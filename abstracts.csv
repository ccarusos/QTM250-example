1	After reaching their highest levels of the 20th century, homicide rates ill the United States declined precipitously in the early 1990s. This study examines a number of factors that might have contributed to both the sharp increase and decline in homicide rates. We Use a pooled cross-sectional time series model to assess the relationship between changes in structural conditions and the change in homicide rates over four decennial time points (1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000). We assess the extent to which structural covariates associated with social, economic and political conditions commonly used in homicide research (e.g., urban decay, poverty, and the weakening of family and social bonds) are related to the change in homicide rates. Along with these classic covariates, we incorporate some contemporary explanations (e.g., imprisonment rates and drug trafficking) that have been proposed to address the recent decline in urban homicide rates. Our results indicate that both classic and contemporary explanations are related to homicide trends over the last three decades of the 20th century. Specifically, changes in resource deprivation and in the relative size of the youth population are associated with changes in the homicide rate across these time points. Increased imprisonment is also significantly related to homicide changes. These findings lead US to Conclude that efforts to understand the changing nature of homicide will require serious consideration, if not integration, of classic and contemporary explanations. 
0	In this study, the dystopian story narrated in Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower is analyzed in detail for the purposes of both examining Robert Putnam’s widely accepted theories of social capital and reconceptualizing it. The protagonist of this story, Lauren, experiences in person the disappointing disillusion of a centrally planned community which is mainly based on Putnam’s social capital. The traces of foundational thinking are found in the collapsed community so that utopianism in Putnam’s social capital ultimately leads to a large range of politico-socio-economic inequalities. The negative influences of these inequalities are primarily reflected in the fact that community members' rights of acting and developing their abilities of critical thinking are deprived. After this bad experience, Lauren starts a persistent, self-reflexive, and adaptive pursuit of realism so as to imagine and act an alternative way of living a better life. A utopian impulse is brought to the forefront in order to sustain this painful yet promising pursuit of reconceptualizing social capital. Though a definite reconceptualization of social capital is not raised, two points are especially highlighted to prevent social capital conceptualization from being assimilated to the abyss of utopianism and repeatedly producing injustice: first is to reject determinism and therefore stick to the “immaterial”, inherent utopian impulse which is believed to flourish in this dialectic tension between resistance and repression; second is to depend on a heterogeneous group of common people who are able to both produce alternative knowledge and rebel against any oppressive authorities.
1	The 2008 collapse of the world financial system, while proximately linked to the housing bubble and risk-laden mortgage backed securities, was a consequence of the financialization of the U.S. economy since the 1970s. This article examines the institutional and income dynamics associated with the financialization of the U.S. economy, advancing a sociological explanation of income shifts into the finance sector. Complementary developments include banking deregulation, finance industry concentration, increased size and scope of institutional investors, the shareholder value movement, and dominance of the neoliberal policy model. As a result, we estimate that between 5.8 and 6.6 trillion dollars were transferred to the finance sector since 1980. We conclude that understanding inequality dynamics requires attention to market institutions and politics.
0	Using 2002 International Social Survey Program data, this study examines (1) whether the association between womens economic resources (full-time job, high income, and college degree) and their attitudes toward marriage differ across 31 countries and (2) whether states approaches on womens employment are associated with how economic resources affect womens attitudes toward marriage. Country-level differences in gender inequality in the labor market and in support for dual-earner couples affect how women view marriage, which may have been one of the unexplored factors affecting recent demographic trends across countries. The results show that for women in countries with generous public childcare services, the negative effect of full-time employment is weaker and the positive effect of education is stronger than those in countries with poor public childcare services. In contrast, the availability of a long parental leave strengthens the association between womens high income and their negative attitudes toward marriage. These findings suggest that states commitment in challenging the gendered division of laborrather than expecting employed mothers to take time off of their workis a vital element in making marriage more attractive to women with more economic resources.
1	Explanations of variability in public opinion on crime have drawn disproportionately from the literature on specific symbolic orientations including religious fundamentalism and racial prejudice. In contrast, this article hypothesizes that public opinion is linked to the strength of a general cultural axis of nations: survivalism vs. self-expressionism. Data are from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey. Hierarchical modeling techniques are used to sort out the bi-level effects of survivalist culture on the approval of prostitution. Controlling for all other predictors, the personal survivalism index was the most powerful predictor of prostitution acceptability, followed by the country-level survivalism index. Unlike previous investigations, which relied on specific symbolic orientations, the present results suggest that attitudes about criminality are linked to a generalized cultural axis.
0	This paper focuses on two Colorado immigrant rights organizations’ repertoires of activism in an unfriendly political climate. This paper highlights how organizations and activists negotiate tactics and strategies in a major election year, when topics such as comprehensive immigration reform are often avoided due to their polarizing effect on voters. I conducted both participant observation and interviews in order to ascertain how activists negotiate framing strategies and interact with broader audiences to garner further support for their goals. Interview and observation data also highlight how immigrants and non-immigrants work together in these movements. Analyzing immigrant rights activism provides insight into how undocumented immigrants, who lack formal political rights, are able to participate in, and attempt to influence, politics on the local, state and national level.
0	National contexts provide very different arenas in which exclusionary attitudes toward immigrants arise and play out. Research suggests that a nation’s political context, as characterized by extreme right-wing party vote, plays an important role in promulgating exclusionary attitudes, particularly in countries with large immigrant populations. In contrast, studies focusing on demographic context assert that the larger the outgroup population in a country, the more potential there is for intergroup contact. Such contact mediates outgroup threat by way of increased familiarization between native and non-native groups. Results from an analysis of public attitudes in 22 OECD countries show that a nation’s demographic context exerts a strong influence on anti-immigrant attitudes, whereby outgroup threat is significantly mediated by familiarization between groups. In contrast, the effects of political context are the reverse of that expected by the extreme right. The public’s anti-immigrant attitudes appear to decrease with the rise of extreme right-wing parties once taking demographic effects into account. Additionally, results show that more specific theories of cultural outgroup threat are only supported in Western European countries, and cannot broadly be supported cross-nationally.
1	"In 2005, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued an official brief on lesbian and gay parenting. This brief included the assertion: ""Not a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents"" (p. 15). The present article closely examines this assertion and the 59 published studies cited by the APA to support it. Seven central questions address: (1) homogeneous sampling, (2) absence of comparison groups, (3) comparison group characteristics, (4) contradictory data, (5) the limited scope of children's outcomes studied, (6) paucity of long-term outcome data, and (7) lack of APA-urged statistical power. The conclusion is that strong assertions, including those made by the APA, were not empirically warranted. Recommendations for future research are offered. "
0	According to prior research, first intercourse during adolescence is a precursor for early union formation.  This research examines whether romantic and nonromantic contexts of adolescent first intercourse increase rates of union formation, controlling for their potential endogeneity.  Utilizing the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth, this research employed discrete-time, competing-hazards models to analyze entry into first co-residential unions among women (n= 8,142).  Both romantic and nonromantic contexts of adolescent first intercourse increased the rate of cohabitation, but not the rate of marriage.  Women who had nonromantic first intercourse during adolescence had lower rates of marriage, while the effect of romantic first intercourse during adolescence reflected endogeneity.  The results suggest that adolescent first intercourse is a precursor of cohabitation, not marriage.
0	I illustrate a number of the deficiencies that currently exist in our understanding of womens participation in prison education, and to offer alternative methods to reduce such deficiencies.  Through a review of studies that examine the conditions of womens prisons and two trend studies examining womens participation in prison education programming between 1979 and 1997, I illustrate a number of the constraints that restrict womens participation in prison education.  Structural conditions of womens prisons are shown to be factors that are known to restrict womens participation.  However, I argue that while structural factors can offer much in our understanding of these phenomena, they do not offer a complete picture.  Since very little is known about the unique and personal motivations of any particular inmate who manages to break through structural barriers that restrict her participation, I argue that new methodologies need to be developed to address these concerns.  Suggestions are made concerning how relevant theoretical perspectives can be used to guide these new methodological techniques.  This research project is designed to be a call to arms that attempts to persuade researchers to move beyond limited methodological procedures that examine the influence of prison education programs on recidivism, and onto projects that examine why some inmates participate and succeed in prison education and others do not.  Only through new methodologies can we begin to understand if these motivational characteristics that may influence participation in prison education can also influence recidivism above and beyond the impact of the educational program itself.
1	This paper uses recent data on tenth graders' performance, and school and family lives to provide a current assessment of generational disparities in math and reading scores, and to evaluate the roles played by a broad range of predictors in creating the observed relative performance of immigrant, second- and third-generation students. In the presence of a wide range of predictors, we find that preschool-aged immigrants outperform the third-plus generation in reading, while the third-plus generation scored higher than school-aged immigrants in reading and outperformed the second generation in both math and reading. We also find that all children of immigrants benefit from very high parental expectations, and that recently arrived immigrants have strong feelings of school attachment which they manifest in pro-school behaviors. In contrast, third-plus generation students socialize more heavily and are relatively indifferent toward school, but have access to more and stronger forms of between-family social capital. These generational differences in attitudes and social capital, and their subsequent effects on generational disparities in academic performance, lend considerable support to the immigrant optimism hypothesis.

1	This study suggests that multitasking constitutes an important source of gender inequality, which can help explain previous findings that mothers feel more burdened and stressed than do fathers even when they have relatively similar workloads. Using data from the 500 Family Study, including surveys and the Experience Sampling Method, the study examines activities parents simultaneously engage in and how they feel when multitasking. We find that mothers spend 10 more hours a week multitasking compared to fathers and that these additional hours are mainly related to time spent on housework and childcare. For mothers, multitasking activities at home and in public are associated with an increase in negative emotions, stress, psychological distress, and work-family conflict. By contrast, fathers' multitasking at home involves less housework and childcare and is not a negative experience. We also find several similarities by gender. Mothers' and fathers' multitasking in the company of a spouse or children are positive experiences, whereas multitasking at work, although associated with an increased sense of productivity, is perceived as a negative experience.
0	This paper is a theoretical exploration of the relationship between beliefs, attributions, and public policy.  The problem statement I am working with is, What accounts for the relationship between beliefs about causes of a characteristic and attitudes towards public policy options in regard to that characteristic?  For the purposes of this paper, a characteristic may be any social category.  Examples include race, gender, social class, sexual orientation, and religion.  Public policy is defined as a guideline or principle intended to influence or determine governmental decisions or actions. I propose that attribution of responsibility for a characteristic (as internal or external) mediates belief and public policy.  I also outline one possible empirical test of this proposition.
0	Parenting is a multifaceted and complex process involving a wide range of knowledge, skills, experiences and activities to encourage childrens development. Indeed, Zigler (1995, p. xi) calls parenting the most challenging and complex of all the tasks of adulthood. Parenting is a major source of identity that profoundly shapes life experiences; however, little sociological work has been done to understand parental satisfaction with their parenting experiences. Existing research has yielded contradictory results, since parents seem to experience both high degrees of personal satisfaction and negative effects on both their satisfaction with life in general and their psychological well-being (Rogers and White 1998; Arendell 1997; Goetting 1986; McLanahan and Adams 1987).  This paper complements previous research by providing rich qualitative data about the nature and meaning of parental satisfaction. It develops a grounded theory of what parents enjoy about parenting, based upon interviews with 32 parents from diverse race and class backgrounds. Parental enjoyment involved five themes, including connecting in interactions with children; profoundly affecting childrens lives; having fun adventures; spending special time doing daily activities where they felt close to their children; and being challenged to learn about themselves and their children by trying new things.
1	Sociologists of religion have often connected secularization to science, but have rarely examined the role of religion in the lives of scientists or how the sciences have changed religiously over time. Here we address this shortcoming by comparing religiosity between two samples of elite academic natural and social scientists, one in 1969 and one in 2005. Findings show an overall decline in religiosity among university scientists as well as a change in their religious composition. Attendance rates were lower for social scientists in 1969 compared to natural scientists, but in 2005 growing parity in attendance occurred between the two fields. Findings also show a decline in the proportion of Protestant scientists and a growth in Catholic scientists. Demographic factors associated with religiosity in the general population, with the exception of age and having children, had no impact among elite academic scientists. Overall, findings challenge and revise older studies on the role of religion in the lives of scientists. Specific results are connected to theories that pose science as a master identity, which may be mitigated by some institutionalized aspects of religion. They also lead to new directions in the sociology of religion that take seriously the role of religion in the lives of elites and connect societal religious changes to differences between institutional spheres, particularly those, such as the academy, that play a leadership role in society.
1	Research on racial-ethnic portrayals in television crime news is limited and questions remain about the sources of representations and how these vary for perpetrators versus victims. We draw from power structure, market share, normal crimes, racial threat, and racial privileging perspectives to further this research. The reported race or ethnicity of violent crime perpetrators and victims are modeled as functions of: (1) situational characteristics of crime stories and (2) contextual characteristics of television market areas. The primary data are from a stratified random sample of television newscasts in 2002-2003 (Long et al. 2005). An important innovation of our work is the use of a national, more generalizeable, sample of local news stories than prior researchers who tended to focus on single market areas. Results indicate that both the context of the story itself and the social structural context within which news stories are reported are relevant to ethnic and racial portrayals in crime news. We find limited support for power structure, market share, normal crimes, and racial threat explanations of patterns of reporting. Racial privileging arguments receive more extensive support.
0	Low-income women are often treated as a homogenous category. For example, research shows that low-income women as a group are at greater risk of having no or inadequate insurance. Yet welfare reform illustrates the diversity of low-income women’s experiences; while some low-income women have gained new access to private insurance since 1996, others have lost access to both public and private insurance. Prior research suggests that continuity of coverage shapes women’s health, but how might unstable work, family, welfare and health insurance factors differentially affect categories of low-income women? Results from a logistic regression analysis of 1,662 women from 1999-2005 provide evidence of a hierarchy of risk among low-income women. Compared to those with stable welfare, work, and family attachments, low-income women who experience welfare, work, and family changes over time are at greater risk of being uninsured or having unmet health needs. Results suggest that poor women’s reliance on public insurance creates different risks for them than their near-poor peers who rely on private insurance. I argue that recent health care reforms have the potential to significantly improve low-income women’s access to insurance, thereby altering the hierarchy of risks low-income women face under the status quo.
1	The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of three different modeling approaches for exploring structural theories of violence. Specifically, ordinary least squares regression, geographically weighted regression and data envelopment analysis will be utilized to evaluate violent crime. This type of analysis expands upon traditional theory testing by deepening our understanding of differences in crime generation and its underlying demographic and socio-economic stimuli via different methodological lenses. A case study for the city of Cincinnati, Ohio is presented and the results suggest that a combination of approaches is likely the best strategy for evaluating violence in urban areas. 
0	This article considers the impact of electoral systems on the structure of politics by exploiting a natural experiment -- the transformation of the Italian political system from pure proportional representation to a mixed proportional/first-past-the-post system. The mixed system is shown to amplify thew perverse characteristcs of each electoral regime; yielding an explosion in the number of parties, a complete transformation of the structure of alliances, and a murky non-ideological politics in which all parties rush to the center of the political landscape, giving rise to a gigantic interconnected component of linked parties.
1	"During China's Cultural Revolution, a large proportion of urban youth were forced to go to the countryside as a result of the state's ""send-down"" policy. Past research has been ambivalent about the long-term social consequences for the Chinese youth who experienced send-down. Some scholars have suggested that the send-down experience may have yielded beneficial effects. To test this claim, we analyze data from the Survey of Family Life in Urban China, which we conducted in three large cities in 1999. Questions available in this data set allow us to ascertain the send-down experience of both the respondent and a sibling and educational attainment at the times of send-down and return. Our analyses of the new data show that the send-down experience does not seem to have benefited the affected Chinese youth. Differences in social outcomes between those who experienced send-down and those who did not are either non-existent or spurious due to other social processes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0	Activities, like child beauty pageants and enrichment learning classes, have attracted a great deal of media attention, usually depicted as examples of parental exploitation and self-fulfillment.  What is not often portrayed is the self-sacrifice on the part of the parents and the discipline required of the children.  This paper explores the question of why parents enroll their children in these activities, based on evidence from four years of fieldwork and in-depth interviews (n=68). The selection of these two groups of parents for study may seem surprising given the presumably vast differences between parents who enroll their children in beauty pageants and those who enroll their children in enrichment courses. But, as I will show, these parents are not entirely different, especially because their underlying motivations are the same, which are to teach their children how to succeed in an increasingly competitive, hierarchical, adult society.  Most importantly though, I identify a parental worldview based on the socialization model of Melvin Kohn that stresses the importance of particular skills that parents believe children need to acquire in order to attain personal and professional success.  In the end I suggest a typology of organized childrens activities to help guide further research.
1	"Using growth curve modeling techniques, this research investigates whether military spending improved or worsened the economic well-being of citizens within the American states during the post-Vietnam War period. We empirically test the military Keynesianism claim that military spending improves the economic conditions of citizens through its use by politicians as a countercyclical tool to reduce the negative effects of economic downturns. However, due to deindustrialization and the emergence of the ""new military,"" there are reasons to believe that military spending will not effectively improve economic well-being during the post-Vietnam War era. Using longitudinal data we find that states with high levels of military spending are better equipped to stave off the deleterious effects of economic recession than are states with lower levels of military spending."
0	Travel ties the global economy with culture, social relations and national images. Although research on it is widespread, macro-structural analysis is largely absent. This article uses an original data set collected from the UNWTO, IMF, World Bank, and UNESCO in order to analyze its global structure and discovers its deep asymmetries – travel is not in fact global but occurs within and between relatively few countries. The degree to which globalized travel is concentrated among a handful of countries is surprising and not obvious. Furthermore, I find that the effects of globalization are neither universal nor consistent but depend upon the identities of countries involved and their relationships with one another. Although inequality differs depending on the relationship, institutional links and cultural wealth are significant across all models.
0	The debates about the relationship between Islam and feminism are lengthy and complicated. It is often assumed that religion that takes on particularly pious forms necessarily contributes to conservative politics. So, what are the implications for womens movements of the more pious forms of Islam that have emerged in the past quarter century? And does pious Islam always produce anti-feminist politics? This paper, based on ethnographic research, argues that Indonesian Muslim women activists draw inspiration from Islam for a variety of political reform projects. These women activists, with their twin attachments to political activism and to religion, embody the new pious Indonesian Islam, whether they are feminist or not, liberal or conservative. For these women, Islam is a crucial resource for political mobilization. Islam also supplies educational and career opportunities and provides motivation for their beliefs about democracy and gender equality. Some women activists see no inherent contradictions between feminist ideas and Islam, because gender equality is central to their notions of being pious Muslims. The Indonesian women I studied reveal that their political action is not an instrumental extension of faith, but an expression of their religiosity itself.
0	In 2009, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill was filed in the Ugandan Parliament. This bill would grant the death penalty for homosexuality in some cases, and life imprisonment in others. The LGBT rights and Anti-Homosexuality movements in Uganda are both part of transnational advocacy networks with connections to Western countries including the United States. As such, they provide a case study of opposing transnational social movements that are engaged in strategic framing struggles. Given that Uganda is a postcolonial sovereign state, the accusation of having politics that are operating under excessive “Western influence” has become an immense liability for both movements. This character of political culture has been exploited in strategic framing, with each movement attempting to paint the other as a pawn of the West. This dynamic has required movements to downplay their own transnational ties, as they emphasize those of the opposition. It has also complicated the efficacy with which movements can deploy “boomerang strategies.” A shift in the political opportunity structure in the Ugandan Ministry of Health has provided an opportunity for LGBT rights activists to alter framing to the domain of public health, and the anti-homosexuality movement has responded in turn. Nonetheless, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill remains pending.
1	We examine the influence of an interstate network created by intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) on the global diffusion of democracy. We propose that IGOs facilitate democracy's diffusion by transmitting information between member states and by interpreting that information according to prevailing norms in the world society, where democracy is viewed as the legitimate form of government. We employ a network autocorrelation model to track changes in democracy among all of the world's countries from 1815 to 2000. We find that democracy does diffuse through the IGO network and that the influence of democratic countries is stronger than that of undemocratic countries. Evidence indicates that the IGO network serves as a basis for normative diffusion. This is an important contribution to sociological accounts of globalization, which tend to emphasize diffusion divorced from network structure or diffusion dependent on the coercive influence of a small set of international organizations.
0	This paper attempts to explain the generation of emotionsthe formations of emotional syntaxby synthesizing Durkheimian ritual theory and Freudian psychoanalytic model.  In this attempt, contemporary theories of emotions, (1) Randall Collins interaction rituals theory, (2) Jonathan Turners evolutionary perspective, and (3) Thomas Scheffs psychoanalytical approaches are applied.  The objective of this paper is to present an idea and model for finding patterns of what Turner calls emotional syntax in empirical encounters.  Finding these patterns of how people present their emotions in encounters has theoretical implications to explain the effects of emotions for social solidarity.  In particular, the study would contribute to the understanding of how positive and negative emotions effect social solidarity.
0	This paper examines one way in which to demonstrate to introductory students the notion of public sociologies.  Exposing students, as early as possible, to the value and strength of sociology in action ultimately facilitates students understanding of the discipline in a way that is engaging, compelling and even at times, ambiguous.    One Introduction to Sociology class (50 students) was paired with 50 agencies in the immediate and surrounding community of Brunswick, ME.  The community agencies were selected by working with the Community Service Resource Center at Bowdoin College.  The Center, only three years old, was struggling to adequately assess the needs of the community agencies and to work with faculty to establish relationships which could fuel stronger campus-community connections.  Introductory students compiled a survey tool by which to ask agencies their needs and interests in working with Bowdoin College.  Furthermore, students then interviewed agency members and conducted field research on the agency, its mission, its immediate research needs and its long- term goals and objectives.    This data was compiled and delivered to the Community Service Research Center, which has used the data to assist agencies and faculty in forging relationships for service, research and community based learning.    For purposes of teaching introductory sociology students this exercise helped to demonstrate the value of sociology as a public good and has given students an important educational experience in understanding the connection between classroom and community.
1	Previous studies suggest that there are strong differences in the rates of youth poverty across European countries. Rather surprisingly, it is found to be high in Scandinavian countries, and relatively speaking, lower in Mediterranean and Anglo-Saxon countries. This somewhat unexpected finding prompts the question whether the incidence of poverty is an appropriate measure of youth disadvantage. Instead of considering poverty rates we consider the length of recorded poverty spells, taking into account explicitly the temporal sequencing of the episodes of poverty. Using the European Community Household Panel, individuals are classified into different groups of poverty permanence, each reflecting severity of social disadvantage. Based on these categories we implement a generalized ordinal logit model to assess the various factors associated with social disadvantage among youth. We find that cross-national patterns differ from those found in previous studies. In particular from our findings it does not result that poverty is highest among young people in Social Democratic countries. Our analysis shows important gender differences, though they are not the same across the countries included in the study. For some countries it turns out that being a woman is a protective factor against long-term poverty. As previous studies suggests, young individuals' living arrangements matter. 
0	Comparing neighborhood efforts to oppose gentrification in the Mission District and West Oakland areas of the San Francisco Bay Area, this paper presents a new twist to a classic debate in the social movement literature between whether movements have more to gain from winning the support of political elites who control material resources, versus mobilizing the discontent of the downtrodden masses to disruptive action.  Framing theories have not yet directly addressed this debate between resource mobilization theorists and their critics from the mal-integration perspective (i.e., Piven and Cloward).  The Mission District adopted a radical frame of communitarian class struggle that alienated elites, yet mobilized its base into a mass movement.  In contrast, the West Oakland movement, which gained elite support while its base remained apathetic, employed a liberalist frame, emphasizing individual-level solutions within the market.  Applying the discursive opportunity structure concept to analyzing these two cases, I suggest that 1) poor peoples movements face a trade-off between resonant frames likely to garner elite support versus radical frames that tap into mass discontent; and 2) anti-gentrification movements and other local efforts to respond to globalization may find that the more radical communitarian frame carries more potential for catalyzing social change than the more resonant liberalist frame.
1	"Furstenberg et al. (1995) suggested that one unanticipated consequence of current high levels of divorce might be a ""matrilineal tilt"" in intergenerational wealth flows. This research uses six waves of the Health and Retirement Survey (1992 to 2002) to investigate this possibility with respect to financial transfers from parents to their adult children. We find that although divorced single fathers continue to make transfers to their adult biological children, remarriage substantially reduces fathers' transfers while it increases mothers' transfers to their biological children. Our findings are consistent with both socio-evolutionary and exchange theories predicting women's vs. men's investments in biological vs. stepchildren."
1	"We analyzed data from 50 states and the District of Columbia from 1960 to 2005 to study how the unemployment rate and the divorce rate are related. Unemployment is positively related to divorce in a bivariate analysis, but the association is not significant when state and year fixed effects are included in the statistical model. When the sample is divided into time periods, unemployment is negatively and significantly associated with divorce after 1980. These findings provide the strongest support for a ""cost of divorce"" perspective and suggest that a high rate of unemployment decreases the rate of divorce, net of unobserved time-invariant state characteristics and period (year) trends.

1	"This paper provides new estimates of Hispanic-white residential segregation in new destinations and established Hispanic places. New Hispanic destinations are defined broadly to include metropolitan Cities, Suburban places, and rural communities with unusually rapid Hispanic growth rates. The analysis is framed with the spatial assimilation and place stratification perspectives and is based on block data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses. The analysis confirms our basic hypothesis - that Hispanics are highly segregated in new Hispanic destinations. often at levels greatly exceeding those in established places. Hispanic suburbanization or exurbanization into new destinations is no marker of spatial assimilation. Consistent with the place stratification perspective, differences in Hispanic-white segregation between new destinations and established Hispanic areas cannot be explained by place-to-place differences in ecological location, Population composition, economic growth, employment, or Hispanic-white income inequality. Hispanic segregation in new destinations is especially sensitive to the size of the foreign-born Population and to preexisting ""minority threats"" in communities with large black populations. Segregation levels in new destinations also are less responsive to income disparities between Hispanics and whites; economic assimilation does not insure Hispanic spatial assimilation. Understanding how newcomers are spatially incorporated in new destinations will be a continuing challenge for scholars concerned about the spatial diffusion and apparent geographic balkanization of America's growing Hispanic Population.

1	The relative income or income status hypothesis implies that people should be happier when they live among the poor. Findings on neighborhood effects suggest, however, that living in a poorer neighborhood reduces, not enhances, a person's happiness. Using data from the American National Election Study linked to income data from the U.S. census, the authors find that Americans tend to be happier when they reside in richer neighborhoods (consistent with neighborhood studies) in poorer counties (as predicted by the relative income hypothesis). Thus it appears that individuals in fact are happier when they live among the poor, as long as the poor do not live too close.
0	This article examines internal dissent (i.e., infighting), a ubiquitous empirical reality in political organizing, to advance a theoretical impasse in the sociology of culture related to the abstract nature of how culture works. The data comprise 1191 newspaper articles, 44 interviews, and hundreds of archival documents that compare infighting across previously unstudied cases of mass protest, namely, 2 lesbian and gay Marches on Washington punctuating a period of 20 years. Analyses reveal that activists use infighting as a cultural carrier to transport ideologies of political organizing. The mechanism by which this occurs is the coupling of infighting with a series of recurring organizing tasks. This coupling concretizes cultural concerns, imbuing logistical decisions with symbolic carrying capacity that gives voice to conversations of identity and strategy once perceived as ineffable. This concretization mechanism opens up a theoretical space that releases the concept of culture from its status as an amorphous, indescribable mist which swirls around society members, in Gary Alan Fines famous words.
0	This exposition analyzes lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer subculture(s) in terms of the reproduction of gendered hierarchies and stratification that mirrors the dominant, heteronormative Western culture. It is found in literature pertaining to identitiy politics and the body politic which LGBTQ subcultures utilize in attempts to resist dominant culture, hierarchies that reproduce and cater to heteronormatives are found pervasive. Utilizing the theories of Pierre Bourdieu, reproduction of gendered stratification is found in habitus and fields through cultural restraints, practices as a means of capital, ownership of LGBTQ identities as specialization, and the marketing of the Queer as a rational, money-making means.
1	Acceptance by the dominant group reveals the current standing of racial groups in the U.S. hierarchy, as well as the possibility for assimilation. However, few researchers have addressed the gendered nature of racial preferences by whites. We examine whites' exclusion of blacks, Latinos. Asians, Middle Easterners, East Indians and Native Americans as possible dates, using a sample of profiles collected from an internet dating website. We find that white men are more willing than white women to date non-whites in general, yet, with the exception of their top two preferences for dates, whites and Latinos, the racial hierarchies of males and females differ. Among daters with stated racial preferences, white men are more likely to exclude blacks as possible dates, while white women are more likely to exclude Asians. We argue that exclusion relates to racialized images of masculinity and femininity, and shapes dating and marriage outcomes, and thus minority groups' possibilities for full social incorporation. 
0	Much existing work in the sociology of culture assumes actor motivations of status and domination.  This tradition highlights important notions of power and inequality, yet it elides those moments when people deploy culture, not only in some social mobility project, but to connect to others.   Based on a three-year ethnography of childrens consumer culture in three diverse communities, I argue that children use commodified goods and experiences less to triumph over others than to belong  both to connect to others, and to achieve a fundamental visibility in their social worlds.  Using insights from Goffman and Randall Collins, I find the children use processes of facework to manage their differences from others, including their differences in commodity possession.
1	"This article examines the origins of tax systems. Through a historical comparison of France and the United States, and analysis of several shadow cases, the article explains why the United States has relied more heavily on progressive income taxation than France, which has favored regressive sales taxes. This study traces the origins of these two tax systems to the early 20th century, arguing that decisions about tax structure were shaped by resistance to the concentration of economic power in the United States and the centralization of state power in France. In the United States, the rapid concentration of economic power in the late 19th century spurred a political movement for a tax with clear redistributive purposes. In France, resistance to the centralization of state power and concomitant fears of ""fiscal inquisition"" weakened the drive for an effective income tax, leaving the state to rely on consumption taxes to meet its revenue needs. These 19th-century movements of resistance to modernization shaped the foundations of contemporary political economy."
1	This research investigates the child care preferences of poor White, African American and Hispanic parents. Using the factorial survey method, this research examines the impact of race and ethnicity on child care preferences and definitions of child care quality. The findings do not support the conclusion that race and ethnicity are a major source of division in preferences for child care. Rather there was consensus around desired core care attributes associated with child care quality. Across racial and ethnic lines, parents wanted safe and regulated care that was evaluated by a government agency with warm and trained caregivers. Findings suggest that differences in child care use by race and ethnicity may not be due to different preferences for particular types of care, but for bundles of care characteristics people may believe are associated with particular care situations. Different child care choices may not stem from cultural differences, but more from market constraints and lack of information. 
0	I examine patterns of educational and social background of the elite over time as well as the effects of social and educational background on stratification within the corporate elite. I ask: Are some fields more likely pathways to the inner circle membership than others? Is there educational stratification by field of study? I investigate associations between education, social background, and inner circle membership using data on members of the Finnish corporate elite in 1980, 1992, and 2004. Using loglinear models, I find that the association between social background and elite changes over time. The proportion of Swedish-speaking elite members plummets over time, while the share of foreign directors soars. Moreover, I find significant changes in the educational background of the elite. Most notably, there is a steep decline in the proportion of lawyers, and a rise in the share of elite members with degrees in business or engineering. I find an association between education and inner circle membership. Social background, however, has no significant effect on elite stratification. In other words, social origin may provide differential access to the elite, but no additional advantages once in the elite.
1	"Based on both archival research and two and a half years of ethnographic fieldwork in an Argentine shantytown with high levels of air water and ground contamination, this article examines the social production of environmental uncertainty. First, we dissect residents' perceptions of contamination, finding widespread doubts and mistakes about the polluted habitat. Second, we provide a sociologically informed account of uncertainty and the erroneous perceptions that underlie it. Along with inherent ambiguity surrounding toxic contamination, the generalized confusion about sources and effects of pollution is the result of two factors: (1) the ""relational anchoring"" of risk perceptions and (2) the ""labor of confusion"" generated by powerful outside actors. We derive two implications from this ethnographic case study: (1) Cognitive psychology and organizational sociology can travel beyond the boundaries of self-bounded communities and laboratory settings to understand and explain the collective production and reproduction of ignorance, uncertainty, and error (2) Research on inequality and marginality in general, and in Latin America in particular should pay close attention to the contaminated spaces where the urban poor live."
0	Collectivist group norms in for-profit firms encourage and reward prosocial behavior to accomplish tasks requiring a high degree of interdependent collaboration. Paradoxically, when prosocial behavior is rewarded, employees may act prosocially for egoistic rather than altruistic reasons. The paper investigates not only the motivations for prosocial behavior but also how these motivations are perceived by coworkers. Two theoretical propositions are developed.  First, coworkers in collectivist workgroups are expected to attribute egoistic motivation to other coworkers, since prosocial behavior in such groups is extrinsically rewarded.  Moreover, egoists are expected to be particularly inclined to make such attributions.  Second, the attribution of egoistic motivation reduces employees’ willingness to trust coworkers and to reciprocate help. While most recent studies of prosociality focus on the effects of prosocial behavior, supporting the view that only actions matter, not intentions, this paper attempts to better understand how individuals perceive others’ motivations and how these perceptions may affect trust and cooperation.  This paper thus argues that intentions matter as well insofar as they have concrete implications for interpersonal trust and reciprocity.
0	Against the recent challenge to qualitative research from evidence-based research, it is worthwhile to ask, how we can account for the success story of qualitative research since the 1970s. Therefore this paper relates the rise of qualitative research to social changes. The analysis shows that the rise of qualitative research is related to the neoliberal regime, in which government works through the creation, shaping, and utilization of human beings as subjects. Thus power works through, and not against, subjectivity. Qualitative research and its interest in subjectivity and experience is an adequate response to this. By way of conclusion, the paper discusses the critical potential of social research.
0	Coercion is a powerful way of organizing collective action.  The self-reinforcing dynamics of coercive mechanisms, such as peer sanctioning or normative enforcement, create strong incentives that produce very high levels of participation.  In the absence of coercive incentives, voluntary collective action can sometime succeed in mobilizing participation, but frequently suffers free riders, who reap the benefits of the collective action without contributing.  I show that although coercively organized systems of collective action may have stronger incentives for participation, and therefore produce greater levels of cooperation than voluntary systems, they have a greater likelihood of failure to due destabilization from accidents, errors and external shocks. Using a threshold model of collective action, similar to previous formal models, I prove that systems of voluntary collective action with free riders have greater long term stability than comparable coercive systems that enjoy stronger incentives and higher levels of cooperation.  This result highlights important features of the micro-macro dynamics in collective action, specifically the surprising consequences of strong individual-level incentives on the stability of the collective action as a whole.  I also demonstrate the significant differences between using discrete time versus continuous time threshold models of collective action, which predict contradictory outcomes and thus make it important to use the more empirically plausible (continuous time) model.
1	We use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine how access to financial resources in the extended family affects the accumulation of wealth among non-owners and how these resources subsequently affect transitioning into homeownership. Our findings show that economic conditions of the extended family have substantial effects on non-owners' wealth accumulation and likelihood of becoming homeowners, even after adjusting for individual sociodemographic and economic characteristics. We find significant effects of extended-family wealth for both black and white households, but effects of extended-family income insufficiency for blacks only. Consequently, limited access to wealth and greater level of poverty in the extended family hamper blacks' transition to homeownership. Our results show that the level of extended-family wealth necessary for black householders to equalize their likelihood of becoming homeowners with whites is very high. In fact, our findings indicate that white householders embedded in extended families with no net wealth are just as likely to make the transition to ownership as are black householders with affluent extended families. These findings support arguments related to the importance of extended-family resources in processes of residential attainment but also point to important racial differences in not only levels but also consequences of these family resources. 
0	How individuals choose their friends is a core question in personal choice and interpersonal relationship. The objective of this paper is to investigate the preference principle in friendship choice. In this paper, we theoretically disentangle the preference effect into identity homophily and status asymmetry, and hypothesize (1) the preference on identity homophily works through identity overlaps with a monotonic effect, (2) the preference on status asymmetry works through a social capital concern on binding with higher status individuals. In the social contexts, however, the data limitation obstructs researchers to identify the net preference effect from structural constraint induced homophily and the reverse relationships between status and friendship choice, which impedes both certifying whether preference matters and by how it works. We first use field experiment method on Internet Society to solve this problem, by conducting an online field experiment in one of the largest Social Network Sites in China, Renren.com. We first register fictitious accounts in Renren.com. After that, we use these accounts to send “adding friend” requests to real users, manipulating the social identity overlaps between fictitious applicants and subjects and the university status of applicants. Then, we continuously record the successful rate of friendship requests. In total, we have 688 cases. This field experiment causally estimates the preference effect on identity homophily and status asymmetry free from other compounds. And the result from the experiment supports our hypotheses. Additionally, we suggest some further implications of field experiment method and utilizations of cyber space for future interpersonal relationship research.
0	There is limited attention to the relationships between various concepts of social capital. This paper fills in this gap. It asks whether two concepts of social capital, network resources and civic networks, represent the same latent construct, and examines their causal relationships. It constructs structural equation modeling analyses, and uses unique two-wave longitudinal data from a national U.S. sample. Results from confirmatory factor analyses show that network resources and civic networks do not reflect a single latent social capital. Results from structural equation modeling further demonstrate the causal flow from civic networks to network resources, while disconfirm the causal flow from network resources to civic networks. These findings imply that a stringent theoretical approach to social capital is preferred. Social capital as a mixed combination of related but distinct social factors can only constrain the heuristic quality of social capital, and obscure the complex social processing involving these factors.
0	Ugandas success in the HIV prevalence rate decline is well documented in the literature.  Although studies pertaining to the impact of the ABC of HIV in Uganda are lacking, some scholars attribute this decline to the ABC strategy that stands for abstinence (A), being faithful to one sex partner (B), and using a condom (C).  Other scholars dispute the success of this strategy in reducing the HIV prevalence rate in Uganda.  With the focus on university students, is the ABC of HIV appears to be the solution to prevent infection among the youth?  Based on data recently collected in Uganda (2007), this study looks at university students sexual behavior and the ABC strategy influential factors.  Findings in this study may shed light on the implications of the ABC of HIV strategy.  Some of the questions answered in this study include: What are the social normative sexual behaviors of university students in Uganda?  Should variations in sexual behaviors of university students be attributed to the ABC program?  What agencies have been influential in shaping the students sexual behavior?  Frequency and cross tabulation phi statistical techniques are utilized to analyze the demographic percentage distribution patterns and associations of variables that predict ABC behavior.  In addition, logistic regression is employed to further isolate agencies such as religion, parents, schools, and media that may have influenced the ABC behavior.  The cross tabulation results reveal that the largest percentage of those that support abstinence is that of the younger respondents (78%) and females (71%).  On the other hand, more males (32%) indicate having more than one sex partner as compared to females (21%).  The majority of the respondents (86%) indicate that religion has been the biggest influence in shaping their attitudes towards ABC behavior, followed by fear of AIDS (84%), and parenthood (83%).  Overall, the effect of ABC on sexual behavior among university students is minimal because 91% of the 299 respondents indicated that they are single but had sex.  Twenty percent of the respondents indicated to have more than one sex partner.  Moreover, 61% indicated that they never or sometimes use a condom.
0	"An image threat occurs when an organization’s audiences or reference publics are given reason to doubt its reliability or claimed conformity to socially acceptable behaviors, norms and values. We examine organizational responses to image threats created by social movement boycotts.  Consumer boycotts, while ostensibly trying to cause a decline in a firm's sales revenue and force them to change a policy or practice, have a pronounced negative impact on their targets' public images. Boycotts may elicit increased efforts by the firm to engage in positive impression management and to reinforce positive audience perceptions. We argue that firms frequently use corporate responsibility initiatives as part of their ""image repertoire"" when dealing with the threat of boycotts. CSR initiatives are especially likely to be used by firms that have built their reputation around being a ""virtuous company."" We draw on social movement theory, a social actor conceptualization of organizations, and institutional theory to examine the conditions in which firms will respond to boycotts with increased levels of CSR. We use a data set of boycotts that were reported in major national newspapers from 1990 to 2005."
1	The migration of Latinos to nontraditional settlement areas in the United States is renewing interest in how an established low-skilled work force is affected by the inflow of a minority group whose members tend to have a weak basket of human capital. Some scholars focus on how the incoming group creates head-to-head competition with established workers. An alternative view posits that, depending on the context of the receiving labor market, incoming workers may primarily fill roles that complement preexisting labor market arrangements. I study these issues in the region of the country that has experienced the most pronounced in-migration of Latinos during the past few years. The findings indicate migrating Latinos tend to complement preexisting labor market conditions rather than spark job competition and undercut the earning power of non-Latinos. 
1	"This study explores how firms shape labor markets and career paths using employee non-compete agreements. The sociology of work has overlooked non-competes, but data indicate that nearly half of technical professionals in the United States are asked to sign such employment contracts. Fearing loss of investments in talent and trade secrets, firms use non-competes to ""strike back"" against technical professionals' increased mobility following the decline of internal labor markets. In-depth interviews with 52 randomly sampled patent holders in a single industry, coupled with a survey of 1,029 engineers across a variety of industries, reveal that ex-employees subject to non-competes are more likely to take career detours-that is, they involuntarily leave their technical field to avoid a potential lawsuit. Moreover, firms strategically manage the process of getting workers to sign such contracts, waiting for workers' bargaining position to weaken. These findings inform our understanding of the social organization of work in the knowledge economy."
0	Prevailing theories of multiculturalism in higher education propose that racial equity can be achieved through a collection of activities to transform or create access, curriculum, institutional diversity and support programs and services for students, faculty and staff of color. Scholars and practitioners have advanced these initiatives through a vast body of literature demonstrating the need for, benefits of, and steps necessary for achieving multiculturalism on campus. Much of this work has depended upon individual level analyses, and has emphasized educational interventions as sufficient for transforming campus culture and achieving racial equity. This paper investigates these claims at the macro-level, using data collected by the National Center for Educational Statistics that annually administers the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System to all post-secondary degree granting institutions in the U.S. The results of a series of OLS regression models are reported which challenge some of the claims of multiculturalism and suggest that more systemic analyses and initiatives are necessary to achieve racial equity in higher education.
0	This paper contributes to the existing literature on the political role and influence of Evangelical Protestants in the United States by comparing them alongside Canadian Evangelicals using both quantitative and qualitative data.  Our findings contrast with those of previous studies in several ways:  First, we find, using survey data, that American Evangelical Protestants are not necessarily as fiscally conservative or anti-government as previously thought; Second, our interview data show that, in some ways, Canadian Evangelicals are actually more devout, more committed to their religious identity than their American counterparts, contrary, again, to common belief.  In sum, we find surprising similarities in the political/moral values of Canadian and American Evangelicals but also surprising dissimilarities in their professed political affiliations and goals.  Theoretically, these results are reminiscent of Gorskis (2000) observations about the changing relationship between the religious sphere and other social spheres in post-Reformation Europe: Amidst an increasingly secular Canadian society, Canadian Evangelicals have become both more religiously devout and more politically mainstream.  In the US, by contrast, Evangelicalism is rather mainstream, while, at the same time, Evangelicals have used matters of faith as rallying cries for political upheaval and electoral mobilization.  These trends are a result, we believe, of the small numbers and marginal social profile of Evangelicals in Canada, in contrast to their widespread presence and influence in the United States.  The different construction of political parties and federal-local jurisdiction in these two polities has also influenced the role of Evangelical religious networks in the political sphere.
1	This article explores the extent to which macro-level characteristics of destination countries, origin countries, and immigrant communities help explain differences in immigrant children educational achievement. Using data from the 2003 PISA survey, we analyze the mathematical performance of 7,403 pupils from 35 different origin countries in 13 Western countries of destination. While compositional differences offer some explanatory power, they cannot fully explain cross-national and cross-group variance. Contextual attributes of host countries, origin countries, and communities are also meaningful. In this regard, strict immigration laws explain immigrant children better educational performance in traditional immigrant-receiving countries. Results further suggest that origin countries' level of economic development can negatively affect immigrant children educational performance, and that immigrant children from more politically stable countries perform better at school. Finally, socioeconomic differences between immigrant communities and a native population, and relative community size, both shape immigrant children scholastic achievement.
0	The following is a discussion of the modernization process in relation to the Kyrgyz Republic.  Kyrgyzstan is a former Soviet Republic bordering China to the east, Kazakstan (worlds 9th largest nation) to the north, Uzbekistan (population over 25 million makes it the second most populous of former Soviet Republics) to the west, and Tajikistan to the south.  Kyrgyzstan gained independence in 1991 and its citizens practice Islam with various levels of diligence.  Identity-based elements are historically discussed culminating in their modern form.  Emphasis is ultimately placed on the Kyrgyz village of At-Bashi.  The goal of this paper is to introduce the significance of the village of At-Bashi in light of modernization and national identity.  Kyrgyz citizens are traditionally nomads and At-Bashi uniquely reflects their nomadic cultural roots.
1	Latent class analysis (LCA) has been hailed as a promising technique for studying measurement errors in surveys, because the models produce estimates of the error rates associated with a given question. Still, the issue arises as to how accurate these error estimates are and under what circumstances they can be relied on. Skeptics argue that latent class models can understate the true error rates and at least one paper (Kreuter et al., 2008) demonstrates such underestimation empirically. We applied latent class models to data from two waves of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), focusing on a pair of similar items about abortion that are administered under different modes of data collection. The first item is administered by computer-assisted personal interviewing 
1	Conventional wisdom holds that friends protect against depression through the social support they provide; however, depression likely has a role in structuring friendship networks. In particular, we investigate friend selection mechanisms responsible for similarity in depression among friends (i.e., homophily). Preference is one explanation, yet several correlates of depression make homophilous selection among depressed individuals unlikely. We propose two alternative mechanisms-avoidance and withdrawal-that can produce depression homophily in the absence of preference. These alternative mechanisms create homophily indirectly by limiting friendship partners available to depressed individuals. We test the preference, avoidance, and withdrawal mechanisms using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and a dynamic network model. Results provide support for the withdrawal mechanism. These findings help explain how depression affects friend selection and have broader implications for understanding selection mechanisms responsible for network patterns such as homophily.
1	This study documents and explains historical variation in U. S. criminal deportations. Results from time-series analyses suggest that criminal deportations increase during times of rising unemployment, and this effect is partly mediated by an elevated discourse about immigration and labor. An especially strong association between deportations and unemployment emerges from 1941 through 1986, a period in which the federal law enforcement bureaucracy and deportation laws were well established and judges retained substantial discretion. After 1986, changes in criminal deportation rates mirror the trend in incarceration rates. The study connects the burgeoning sociological literatures on immigration and punishment, revealing a historically contingent effect of labor markets on the criminal deportation of non-citizen offenders.
0	This paper is a response to Lucas' (1999) recommendation that other researchers test some of his hypotheses using data across time and from other time periods. It examines the meritocracy of  high school course taking patterns before and after the unremarked revolution' in tracking. Data come from the transcripts of four graduating classes from 1960 to 1975 in one upper middle class suburban high school very homogeneous in the class and ethnic background of the students. The relationship of ascriptive (gender) and achievement criteria to the placement of students in high school English and math courses in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades is investigated. The study focuses on whether the basis of course taking was dominated by prior achievement in one domain, prior to 1965, as opposed to being based on prior achievement in each subject area, subsequent to 1965, which is Lucas' hypothesis about the nature of course taking before and after the unremarked revolution' in tracking. Thus, the relative strength of achievement in English and math on placement in English courses and math courses is examined. The results indicate that gender is more strongly and consistently related to math than to English course enrollment. Whether course taking is meritocratic at West Suburban depends on the subject of the course and the level of the course. Further, prior English achievement dominates enrollment in both subjects in all graduating classes for both advanced college prep English and math. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed
0	This paper explores how the introduction of policies, both private in the form of work/family policies offered by individual corporations, and public in the form of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), have come to alter men and womens perceptions regarding the intersections between their work and family lives. Findings suggest that since the 1990s with the adoption of work/family policies at many workplaces and the adoption of the FMLA in 1993, women have come to perceive work/family conflict as a public responsibility at higher rates than men.  Gender differences in perceptions of work/family conflict as a public or private issue are significantly different regardless of individuals ratings of their employers family friendliness or if their workplace is covered under FMLA or private work/family benefits. These findings suggest that gender differences between men and women, when controlling for demographic as well as workplace characteristics, remain significantly different regarding perceptions of work/family conflict as a public or private issue.
1	This article examines how widely shared cultural values shape social problem construction and, in turn, can reproduce social inequality. To do so, we draw on a comparative case study of American news reporting on eating disorders and overweight/obesity between 1995 and 2005. In the contemporary United States, thinness is associated with high social status and taken as evidence of moral virtue. In contrast, fatness is linked to low status and seen as a sign of sloth and gluttony. Drawing on an original data set of news reports, we examine how such social and moral meanings of body size inform news reporting on eating disorders and overweight. We find that the news media in our sample typically discuss how a host of complex factors beyond individual control contribute to anorexia and bulimia. In that anorexics and bulimics are typically portrayed as young white women or girls, this reinforces cultural images of young white female victims. In contrast, the media predominantly attribute overweight to bad individual choices and tend to treat binge eating disorder as ordinary and blameworthy overeating. In that the poor and minorities are more likely to be heavy, such reporting reinforces social stereotypes of fat people, ethnic minorities, and the poor as out of control and lazy. While appreciation for bigger female bodies among African Americans is hailed as protecting against thinness-oriented eating disorders, this same cultural preference is partially blamed for overweight and obesity among African American women and girls.
1	This article extends theories of social movement diffusion to encompass other kinds of cultural modeling. Using a comparison of two cases of food protest in the United Stales the health food movement of William Sylvester Graham (1830s) and the early organic movement (1960s-1970s)-I emphasize similarities in underlying grievances and in the general advocacy of natural food alternatives. The two movements differed dramatically, however, in framing and tactics. I focus on contrasts in the religious significance they assigned to diet, in their democratic commitments, in the relationship they constructed between personal transformation and social change, and in their use of state-centered strategies. These frames and tactics transposed to food reform more general scripts associated with cultural institutions and movements of the time, particularly evangelical churches and temperance (Grahamites), and environmentalism, the New Left, and the wider counterculture (organic advocates).
1	Tests of the racial threat hypothesis, linking the racial composition of place to various measures of social control, find that where there are greater percentages of blacks, more punitive criminal justice policies are implemented. Just as the criminal justice system continues to get tougher on crime despite stagnant crime rates, it is also clear that schools are becoming harsher toward student misbehavior and delinquency despite decreases in these school-based occurrences. However, only a very limited number of studies have been able to partially explain this trend of intensifying social control in schools. Using a national sample of 294 public schools, the present study is the first to test the racial threat hypothesis within schools to determine if tire racial composition of students predicts greater use of punitive controls, regardless of levels of misbehavior and delinquency. Results of multivariate analyses support the racial threat perspective, finding that schools with a larger percentage of black students are not only more likely to use punitive disciplinary responses, but also more likely to use extremely punitive discipline and to implement zero tolerance policies. They also use fewer mild disciplinary practices and restitutive techniques: In addition, racial threat is more influential when school delinquency and disorder are lower.
0	In light of recent economic events in the United States, there has been widespread discussion about the morally questionable actions of financial elites.  It would be beneficial to address these questions, and examine the relationship not only between morality and social class, but also taking into consideration the effects of religion on moral attitudes and the behaviors these attitudes provoke.  For the purpose of simplicity, morality is taken to mean behavior and beliefs that conform to moral law or socially accepted moral standards.  Likewise, the U.S. class structure is identified as a multidimensional construct that relies equally upon economic and social identity; the class structure is less a group of distinct categories, but rather more of a continuum that, generally speaking, contains upper, middle, and lower levels.   Also, we will look at how intragenerational mobility may be related to this issue:  Do standards of morality become more flexible if an opportunity for upward mobility or gain is perceived, and how does this vary across the continuum of the class structure?  Finally, how does this influence peoples actions in the realms of politics and the economy, particularly in pecuniary matters that are likely to have a large scale effect on society?
0	Scholars who study the development of democratic institutions in China have generally assumed that market reforms facilitate this development. This paper examines management practices in Chinas workplaces, an area in which market reforms haveon the contraryundermined democratic institutions. After the Communist Party came to power in 1949, it transformed urban workplaces into communist-style work units based on permanent employment. Power was concentrated in the hands of party cadres, but the party made democratic management a central legitimating slogan of its workplace administration. It organized employees into small teams that managed their own affairs and it mobilized work unit members to monitor management cadres. Based on interviews with scores of factory workers and cadres, as well as analysis of contemporary documents, we examine what democratic management actually meant in practice and consider the impact of the recent market-oriented restructuring of state-owned enterprises. We first develop a model of paternalistic democracy to describe labor relations under the work unit system, and then show that this model has been systematically undermined by market reforms, which have eroded workers membership rights and led to much more coercive labor relations.
1	In this study we examine the social and economic factors driving internal migration flows in Mexico. We pay particular attention to the effect that economic liberalization has had in encouraging migration to border cities. Our analysis of the origin and destination of migrants is carried out at a finer level of geographical detail than ever before. Microdata files from the 2000 population census allow us to distinguish urban- and rural-origin migrants to the largest 115 cities and metropolitan areas in the country. Our results indicate that economic liberalization, measured by the level of foreign investment and employment in the maquiladora export industry, strongly influences migrants' choice of destinations. However, economic liberalization fails to fully account for the attraction of the border, as do the higher emigration rates to the United States from border cities. Our analysis also reveals that migrants to the border region and to cities with high levels of foreign investment are younger, less educated and more likely to be men than migrants to other parts of Mexico. Rural migrants are significantly more likely to move to the border and to cities with high levels of foreign investment than urban migrants. The results of our study have important implication for other countries opening their economies to foreign investment and international trade. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	Aura is a concept often cited in studies of culture but one that is under-theorized. Field theory, once popular in the social sciences, has fallen from favor. Cognitive psychological approaches are treated by most sociologists with trepidation. This paper brings together the concept of aura, principles of field theory, and cognitive approaches to perception into a theory of aesthetic fields.
0	Neither “migration” nor “immigration” adequately defines the life trajectories of all people transcending and attempting to integrate into globally networked, transnational spaces.  In this essay, I suggest the promotion of and use of the transnational, global term “im/migrant,” pronounced “im/my-grint,” rather than the nationalistic “we” and “them” designations of “migrant” and “immigrant.” We have transnational im/migrant capital, transnational im/migrant commodities, and transnational im/migrant culture, so the logical next step is to legitimate the transnational im/migrant body.  Using the “gap hypothesis” of Cornelius, Tsuda, Martin, and Hollifield (2004) as an analytic frame, I demonstrate that the gap between structural policy and structural outcomes runs parallel to the gap between immigrant agendas and immigrant outcomes and migrant agendas and migrant outcomes.  Therefore, transnational actors are neither “migrants” nor “immigrants,” but im/migrants, which transcend and exist in a transnational, globalized world.  Data consists of fifty-two semi-structured interviews with Yucatec-Mayan im/migrants from Yucatán State, México, over a three-year period.  The focus is on one generalizable im/migrant agenda, and one strategy from which the “migrant” and the “immigrant” become interchangeable designations, therefore evoking a new, global “im/migrant” designation.  1) The agenda of obtaining permanent residence in the United States, and the gap between that agenda and actual outcomes.  2) Marriage serves as one strategy for shifting from a migrant agenda to an immigrant agenda, thereby evoking the perpetual, im/migrant actor.  I suggest that the term “im/migrant” is a more accurate representation of the transnational individual.
1	"Using 2006 General Social Survey data, the authors compare levels of segregation by race and along other dimensions of potential social cleavage in the contemporary United States. Americans are not as isolated as the most extreme recent estimates suggest. However, hopes that ""bridging"" social capital is more common in broader acquaintanceship networks than in core networks are not supported. Instead, the entire acquaintanceship network is perceived by Americans to be about as segregated as the much smaller network of close ties. People do not always know the religiosity, political ideology, family behaviors, or socioeconomic status of their acquaintances, but perceived social divisions on these dimensions are high, sometimes rivaling racial segregation in acquaintanceship networks. The major challenge to social integration today comes from the tendency of many Americans to isolate themselves from others who differ on race, political ideology, level of religiosity, and other salient aspects of social identity."
0	This paper investigates organic agriculture in Maine, with a comparative eye turned to the opposite coast.  Californias organic agriculture has been the subject of intense scrutiny (Guthman 2004; Mello 2006; Pollan 2006) and many have reached the conclusion that organic agriculture is bifurcated into an organic industry and an organic movement.  Recent analyses have also shown how the organic industry has come to dominate organic agriculture and to replicate many of the undesirable features of conventional agriculture.  The analysis of organic agriculture in Maine reveals that, at present, Maine has avoided many of the negative consquences of the organic industry, largely because of the smaller size and scale of the organic sector in Maine and through a deliberate (and state-supported) strategy of localization.  Maines organic agriculture remains closer to the organic ideal type and to its movement origins, and hence provides one model for an alternative and sustainable agriculture.
0	In this paper, I wish to discuss G. H. Meads reaction to the First World War, an episode in the history of sociological ideas in which the complex relation between the twin projects of modernity and sociology comes to the fore. As we shall see, Meads radical democratic ideals and his scientific approach to the human consciousness were put to the test and resisted in an exemplary way. The First World War constituted a challenge for the intellectuals and scientists of the beginning of the twentieth century. It is fair to say that a whole generation of social thinkers, including sociologys classic figures, was offered the chance of superseding particularistic and non-scientific prejudices in the name of scientific objectivity and impartiality. Most of them, however, failed to meet that challenge. In what follows, I will try to show that this was not true of Mead.

I address the theoretical underpinnings of the migration-development model through world-systems theory, power-transition theory, and the TCC perspective to explain the dichotomy of the model in the cases of China, India, South Korea and Taiwan. While some governments, NGOs, and intellectuals in the South posit that the migration development model is counter-hegemonic; I argue that it is not necessarily a successful counter-hegemonic strategy to combat Western economic domination.
0	Cultural sociologists cant seem to resist psychology. Durkheim relied on crowd psychology and Mesmerism, Alexander on Freud and theories of psychological flow. Only practice theories forego psychology, but at the expense of analyzing motivation (Smith 2003: 143). Cultural sociology needs psychology because it needs to theorize internalization and motivation in order to explicate how culture influences daily life. Recent work in cognitive neuroscience and psychology provides valuable resources for cultural theorists, because it specifies psychological phenomena associated with ritual behavior, and shows how culture is internalized in neural networks fusing cognitive and bodily modalities.
0	Why are Muslim immigrants in Europe perceived as contentious while Latino immigrants in the United States are often perceived as passive? What explains these different perceptions? This project uses surveys and multi-sited ethnography to study the avenues for political voice and integration of immigrants. It takes into account the role of the sending community in individual meaning-making as well as the socialization and institutional practices of the receiving community. The transnational circuit of Mexico-New York is compared with those of Algeria-Paris, and Morocco-Barcelona. The results point to the importance of the state in creating perceptions of belonging and exclusion and how they get translated into different forms of contentious politics.
0	Drawing on accounts from interviews with 15 lesbian couples with children born using DI living in the California Bay Area, this paper focuses on the use of parental terms, such as “Momma” and “Mommy,” as a means of enacting and displaying motherhood. The use of these terms have deeply personal and emotional meanings for parents in building unique parent-child relationships that must at the same time be reconciled with their legibility in public spaces. In both these internal and external contexts the legibility and emotional meanings tied to terms are connected to biologically essentializing views of motherhood and kinship. In particular, the selection of parental terms is both informed by couples wishing to inter-personally and publicly acknowledge the mother identity of non-biological mothers while at the same time limiting the terms that  some parents use.
1	Qualitative and quantitative research has Suggested that married couples handle the increasing demands of intensive parenting norms and work expectations by reducing spousal time (e.g., the time that spouses spend alone with each other). Using nationally representative time-diary data, this study examined whether married individuals with children at home lost more spousal time in the years 1975-2003 than individuals without children at home. The analyses showed that on average married individuals have reduced their spousal time by 50 minutes a day. Contrary to expectations, however, individuals with minor children at home had lower time declines than individuals without children. The strategies that assisted married individuals with children to protect their Spousal time differed between weekdays and weekend days.
1	A popular explanation for race and ethnic disparities in academic achievement is that minorities are exposed to different peers and have different opportunities to make friends with high-achievers. Although we know that adolescents from different race and ethnic groups attend different schools and that they choose different friends, we do not know how these different opportunities affect the friends they make. This paper fills this gap by studying how the opportunities within adolescents' schools affect race and ethnic differences in the academic characteristics of friends. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the conditional logit and opportunities framework, I account for adolescents' different opportunities to make friends both within and across schools. Ignoring their different opportunities, Black and Latino adolescents' nominated friends have significantly lower levels of achievement than white adolescents. After accounting for their different opportunities to make friends within and between schools, race and ethnic differences in the achievement characteristics of friends disappear. If Black and Latino adolescents' opportunity structures were identical to white adolescents', their probabilities of nominating high-achieving friends would not differ. 
1	"Throughout much of 2001 the Mobilization for Global Justice Coalition (MGJC) planned a series of mass demonstrations targeting the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to occur in Washington. DC in late September The terrorist attacks of September 11 created a crisis for the 117 social movement organizations (SMO) involved in the broad-based coalition and forced protest leaders to reevaluate their coalition strategy. This analysis chronicles the dissolution of the MGJC and explains the decisions made by SMO leaders to abandon or disband the coalition. By leading their organizations in ways they expected to be perceived as legitimate in the eyes of key allies and supporters, leaders sought to preserve their SMO's core exchange relationships through the 9/11 crisis. At a minimum, leaders sought to insulate their organizations from irreparable harm and position them competitively for the uncertainties of the post-crisis environment. Many organizations made decisions commensurate with homophilous or exemplary organizations in a process resembling ""social contagion"" while others capitalized on the crisis enhancing their influence. This research relies upon participant observations of pre- and post-9/11 organizing meetings, examination of coalition documents, and interviews with key MGJC leaders."
1	We used adopted and biological children from Waves I and 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households to study the links between parents' marital conflict, divorce and children's behavior problems. The standard family environment model assumes that marital conflict and divorce increase the risk of childrens behavior problems. The passive genetic model assumes that parents' and children behavior are linked because of genetic transmission from parents to children. The child effects model assumes that parents' marital distress is the result of (rather than the cause of) children's behavior. Our analysis shows that the associations between parents' divorce and marital conflict and children's behavior problems are comparable for biological and adopted children. Moreover, the primary direction of influence appears to run from parents to children. Taken together, these results Provide support for the standard family environment model.
0	The social movement literature offers several approaches to understanding governments policy response to the demands of movement activists.   Not all of these explanations specify how the independent variables should shape government decision-making, and if they do, they too often fail to demonstrate such a process.  The framing approach tends to exhibit such shortcomings.  Framing analysis seems particularly unsuited to explaining government policy response, although it has proven useful for illuminating the important role played by audience perceptions of movement issues, events, and actors.  Its broad definitions and loose hypotheses render it difficult to prove wrong.  Therefore, I present a set of hypotheses based on the framing approach that can be falsified, and then test them against data from the nationalist movement in Quebec (1960-present).  The framing approach fails to explain the major concessions offered to Quebec by the Canadian government, although it can shed light on the attitudes of the domestic population toward Quebecs autonomy attempts.  An alternative approach to understanding government response to regional movements is briefly discussed.  The intent is not to dismiss the framing approach, but merely to suggest that we define and operationalize it more precisely to determine which questions it is most suited to answer.
1	Underage drinking among American youth is a growing public concern. However, while extensive research has identified individual level predictors of this phenomenon, few studies have theorized and tested the effect of structural social forces on children's and youths' alcohol consumption. In an attempt to address this gap, we study the effects of residential environments on children's and youths' underage drinking (while accounting for personality and familial processes). Integrating informal social control and opportunity explanations of deviance, we first suggest that while neighborhood collective efficacy prevents adolescents' underage drinking, individuals' access to local alcohol retail shops encourages such behavior. Focusing on the interactive effects of communal opportunities and controls, we then suggest that high presence of alcohol outlets and sales in the neighborhood is likely to increase youths' probability of alcohol consumption in the absence of communal mechanisms of informal social control. We test our theoretical model using the unprecedented data design available in the PHDCN. Results from a series of multilevel logit models with robust standard errors reveal partial support for our hypotheses; specifically, we find that alcohol sales in a given neighborhood increase adolescents' alcohol use. In addition, while the direct effect of collective efficacy is insignificantly related to children's and youths' alcohol consumption, our models suggest that it significantly attenuates the effect of local alcohol retailers and sales on underage drinking. 
1	"Using a model of student dropout with only two possible outcomes - ""still in school"" or ""dropout"" - hides the complex reasons that students leave high school. We offer a model with three outcomes: in school, pushed out or pulled out. Using data from the Educational Longitudinal Survey, we find that for black students, differences in SES explain higher likelihoods of being either pushed or pulled out as compared to white students, but Latino students remain more likely to be pulled out even after we control for SES. We also find that SES moderates the relationship between race/gender and being pushed out, and that higher levels of SES may be detrimental to students of color in the context of high poverty schools."
1	This article offers a theoretical and empirical analysis of legal endogeneity-a powerful process through which institutionalized organizational structures influence judicial conceptions of compliance with antidiscrimination law. It finds that organizational structures (e.g., grievance and evaluation procedures, antiharassment policies) become symbolic indicators of rational governance and compliance with antidiscrimination laws, first within organizations, but eventually in the judicial realm as well. Lawyers and judges tend to infer nondiscrimination from the mere presence of those structures. Judges increasingly defer to organizational structures in their opinions, ultimately inferring nondiscrimination from their presence. Legal endogeneity theory is tested by analyzing a random sample of 1,024 federal employment discrimination opinions (1965-99) and is found to have increased over time. Judicial deference is most likely when plaintiffs lack clout and when the legal theories require judges to rule on unobservable organizational attributes. The authors argue that legal endogeneity weakens the impact of law when organizational structures are viewed as indicators of legal compliance even in the face of discriminatory actions.
1	"The subjective assessment of personal income, insofar as it reflects or sheds light upon the (potentially different) economic incentive structures facing workers of different demographic groups, has far-reaching implications for public policy and private decision-making alike. This paper explores the impact of personal income on financial satisfaction and on perceived income, focusing on demographic differences across the following groups: white males, black males, white females and black females. The results indicate that different race/gender pairs do respond to income differently. For both financial satisfaction and perceived relative income, white females, black females and black males all have lower returns to personal income than do white males. White males, in other words, appear to reap more ""bang for the buck"" in terms of both of the outcome variables, even after a host of control variables are introduced. The possibility that social comparison among (racial and gender) ingroups is driving the observed demographic differences is discussed. "
1	Based on studies showing health advantages for breastfeeding mothers and their infants, pediatricians and other breastfeeding advocates encourage new mothers to breastfeed their babies for at least the first six months of their infants' lives, arguing that breast milk is best for infants, families, and society, and it is cost free. Few empirical studies, however, document how the decision to breastfeed instead of formula-feed is associated with women's post-birth earnings. This is an important omission, given that the majority of women today work for pay, and many work in job environments incompatible with breastfeeding. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, our results show that mothers who breastfeed for six months or longer suffer more severe and more prolonged earnings losses than do mothers who breastfeed for shorter durations or not at all. The larger post-birth drop in earnings for long-duration breastfeeders is due to a larger reduction in labor supply. We discuss the implications of these findings for gender equality at home and at work.
0	Mexico and Morocco share many common characteristics as labor migrant pools for industrialized countries to the north.  However, comparisons between migrants from each country are few, particularly with respect to economic outcomes using nationally representative data.  Using recent immigrant surveys from Spain and the United States, this paper presents the first quantitative analysis to compare Moroccans and Mexicans, testing for the effects of human and social capital on employment, occupational attainment, and wages.  Although the lower employment levels of Moroccans compared to Mexicans would seem to suggest greater labor market discrimination against Moroccans in Spain, inspection of the returns to various forms of capital and other inputs yields a more mixed picture.  Both methodological and social explanations for these mixed findings are discussed.
0	Previous research shows that low-income, minority, female-headed households have greater difficulty returning to their homes after a disaster like Hurricane Katrina, but it may be that these groups are more likely to be displaced from their pre-disaster homes because they live in rental housing. This research focuses on how housing tenure influences displacement from a pre-Katrina home among a sample of low-income parents in New Orleans. We find that pre-Katrina renters were twice as likely, and renters of publicly subsidized housing were three times as likely, to be living in a new home than were homeowners about a year after the hurricane. After controlling for housing tenure and housing-related variables, participant’s socio-demographic characteristics become insignificant suggesting that housing tenure accounts for much of the vulnerability of these socio-demographic groups. Our study untangles some of the links in the causal chain connecting pre-disaster housing tenure to return to a pre-disaster home. It also contributes to a growing body of sociological literature about the non-financial advantages associated with homeownership and disadvantages associated with renting.
0	This paper describes an initial attempt to integrate aging content into two required research courses via a qualitative research experience for students.  The model employed required collaboration between the disciplines of social work and sociology in a small rural program. Students, receiving initial instruction in qualitative research, were required to work in groups to develop an interview schedule around an assigned topic and complete qualitative interviews with older adults. Continuing into the second course, students analyzed and produced a paper regarding. Additionally, an analysis of their learning process was completed. Implications of the model and lessons learned are explicated.
0	Using a multi-method approach (including a survey, interviews, and observations), this paper compares the fathering of a group of professionals (physicians) to working-class men (emergency medical technicians--EMTs). First, we show that these two groups of men practice different types of fatherhood. Physicians emphasize public fatherhood which entails attendance at special events but little involvement in the daily care of their children. In contrast EMTs are not only involved in their childrens public events but also emphasize private fatherhood which entails involvement in their daily care. Second, we suggest that these differing types of involvement can be explained by the contrasting employment conditions of each group as well the characteristics of their families, especially the divergent labor market positions of spouses and the gendered division of parenting. We suggest that working class fathers are undoing gender while professional fathers reproduce the conventional gender order.
1	This paper examines the factors associated with the tempo of low-income couples relationship progression into sexual involvement and coresidence. Data come from a recently-collected survey, the Marital and Relationship Survey (MARS) that obtained information from low- to moderate-income married and cohabiting couples. Over one-fifth of male and female respondents reported becoming sexually involved with their current partner within the first week of dating. Entrance into shared living was also quite rapid; about one-third of respondents moved in with their partner within 6 months. Furthermore, about two-thirds of married respondents initially cohabited with their partners. Indicators of family disadvantage accelerated entrance into sexual involvement and coresidence; these effects are more pronounced for women than men. Our results also suggest that the pace of relationship progression, into sexual involvement as well as shared living, has accelerated among unions formed more recently. 
0	This study examines how institutional arrangements and policy trajectories typical of a country interact with structural positions to affect attitudes to government redistribution through analysis of data from a national representative sample survey conducted in China in 2004. Four structural cleavages in attitudes that bear the imprints of distinct institutional and policy history in pre- and post-reform China are found: urban-rural variation, regional difference, SOE (state-owned enterprise)/non-SOE cleavage, and cohort effect. Older people and SOE employees are more likely to support governments role in reduction of income gap and welfare provision, a finding consistent with interest-based model. However, urban people who have been at an advantaged position express stronger preference for government responsibility for provision of an array of welfare benefits than rural people, and less developed middle and west regions are more reluctant to endorse governments role in either narrowing of income gap or in provision of welfare than the most prosperous east coastal area. These patterns, although seemingly contradicting self-interest assumption, are explained by group variations in expectations of and dependence on state protection, which are shaped by the institutional contexts in which different groups are situated. This study sheds light on developing comprehensive theories of public opinions about the welfare state.
0	Based on 42 in-depth interviews with members of three former Colombian guerrilla organizations, M-19, EPL, and CRS, reasons why they stayed in these organizations through several years, if not decades, of violent confrontation with government forces are examined. From a micro-level perspective, the study identifies four important motivations for members to remain in these groups: personal dependence on their organization, shared values with other members and the group, the clandestine life-style, and self-identity, which is boosted by the subjects feeling that their work in the group matters.
1	Previous studies indicate that school friendship networks of sexual minority students (students with non-heterosexual orientations) consist mostly of straight peers, but little is known about these straight friends. This paper examines what background characteristics predict straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends by analyzing friendship nomination data from two large high schools included in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Straight females are more likely than straight males to have cross-orientation friendships particularly with sexual minority males. Like friendships among straight students, cross-orientation friendships show a strong homophilous tendency-straight students choose sexual minority friends within their grade levels, racial groups, and academic aptitude levels. Beyond homophily, white race and high levels of academic aptitude and parent education increase straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends in some gender combinations, consistent with previous research showing the links between these backgrounds and positive attitudes toward sexual minorities.

0	Women have made significant inroads in the academy and have increasingly garnered success in higher education; however, as researchers, we need to complicate the notion of success in order to interrogate how women faculty continue to exist in a precarious state at the university. This study attempts to address how women faculty, particularly those who also identify as racial minorities, daily negotiate their presentation of self in academic spaces by examining processes of embodiment. In order to elaborate the idea of performing bodies in relation to academic governance, I entered the field with a set of two primary research questions. First, how do women negotiate their presentation of self as faculty at a university? Second, how does the embodiment and performance of gender, sexuality, and race shape their daily decisions about their appearance? In order to properly undertake this study, the body becomes a central text to read the experiences of women faculty in the academy. In this paper, I draw from in-depth, qualitative interviews to highlight three case studies. Consistent with the literature, the findings from the interviews overwhelmingly show evidence for the embodiment of professionalism, particularly regarding decision making processes about appearance and presentation. In addition, issues around how gender, race, and sexuality influence the subjects presentation of self manifested in more inexplicit ways than anticipated at the beginning stages of this project; rather, gender, race and sexuality seemed to be more prominently embodied through issues around competency, authority, and respect.
0	Are humans motivated solely by self-interests? Or are they also driven by values concerning altruism and equality? Those are among the fundamental questions long under debate in social sciences. The observation that humans routinely perform acts that are cooperative or other-benefiting does not resolve the controversy easily, as such behaviors could just be strategies to maximize self-interest in the long run or in response to incentives in the social environment. It thus has been a challenge for researchers to demonstrate empirically that other motives, such as altruistic or prosocial values internalized by individuals, exert non-negligible influence on actual behavior, net of any long-term self-interested strategic calculation. This research examines the value-behavior relation using games with non-trivial monetary incentives. Firstly, individuals value priorities are measured through the Schwartz value questionnaire. Then, self-focus interventions are employed to enhance individuals self-awareness without their knowledge. Finally, participants play the one-shot dictator game where one unilaterally decides how to divide a given sum of money between oneself and another person. The games structure offers no incentive for a purely self-interested player to allocate money to the other player. The results, however, show that a non-trivial portion of the money is allocated to the other person. Furthermore, we find significant correlations between individuals self reported value priorities and their non-egoistic allocation behavior. But we do not find self-awareness to differentially impact people whose value priorities differ. Instead, aroused self-awareness seems to enhance individuals prosocial tendencies regardless of their value priorities.
1	This study examines endorsement and authorization as two social mechanisms that can induce perceptions of legitimacy for individuals who manage work teams. Endorsement is the support of a manager by one's own team members, whereas authorization is the support of a team manager stemming from a higher bureaucratic level. Applying these mechanisms to specific work teams we hypothesize that (1. a team member who observes that other team members endorse a manager and the upper management authorizes the manager will perceive that manager's acts to be more legitimate; (2. in the context of the team environment the effect of endorsement will be greater than that of authorization; and (3. perceived legitimacy will mediate the effects of endorsement and authorization on positive outcomes such as team members' efficacy and commitment. These hypotheses were tested using 320 respondents from 56 Korean work teams. The results provide overall support of these hypotheses. As predicted, endorsement and authorization are key mechanisms significantly enhancing legitimacy. Further, the effect of endorsement on legitimacy is greater than that of authorization, and legitimacy partially mediates the effects of both endorsement and authorization on team efficacy and commitment. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of prevailing theories of legitimacy.
0	This study challenges the conventional wisdom that elderly, child and overall poverty are divergent.  Comparing the official U.S. measure with the Luxembourg Income Studys (LIS) measure, I show that the official measure underestimates elderly poverty by a significant amount and child poverty by a lesser amount.  The elderly were considerably more likely to be poor than children in the 1970s, children were more likely to be poor 1984-1997, but the elderly were more likely to be poor in 2000.  Both the elderly and children are much more likely to be poor than the overall population.  Analyses of 18 rich Western democracies show that overall and child poverty are very strongly positively correlated, while elderly poverty is moderately correlated with those two.  Multivariate analyses show some commonalities and some differences in the sources of these three.  Two measures of the welfare state significantly reduce overall, elderly and child poverty.  While female labor force participation reduces all three, manufacturing employment, economic performance and demographic variables only influence one or two of the dependent variables.
0	This paper will examine the debate surrounding the use of flow cytometry and preimplantation genetic diagnosis to sex select children for social reasons in order to interrogate the meanings of sexed sperm and embryos.  By analyzing this specific node within the larger domain of both sex selection and the new reproductive technologies, I hope to create an initial site of entry into the complex webs that have constructed this controversy.  A sample of written publications from May 2001  May 2002, appearing in newspapers, popular magazines and science/medical/bioethics journals, have been examined. This paper will begin by mapping the social worlds that have represented their positions within these media on preconception sex selective technologies; specific focus will be paid to the meanings that sorted sperm and sexed embryos have to each group.  I hope to further problematize the ethical debate surrounding sex selection by considering whose voices were not articulated in the resolution of this debate in order to highlight the role of power.  The paper will conclude with a discussion of how divergent groups came together to translate the diverse meanings of sex selected sperm and embryos during a key historical moment in both the technical and sociocultural trajectories in order to maintain the project of sex selecting children.
0	This study investigates the characteristics of assault victimization within the United States, the Netherlands, and Northern Ireland.  Using data from the International Crime Victimization Survey I highlight differences between countries in the prevalence of assault victimization and other characteristics of assault, including the location of the attack, force used, and injury as a result.  A regression of routine activities variables on assault victimization emphasizes the importance of examining lifestyle measures of the respondents, including living arrangements, age considerations, and area of residence.  Of interest in this study is the applicability of routine activities theory to countries other than the United States in efforts to further criminological research.
0	For the last three decades global capitalism has been marked by the financial logic of accumulation. From developmentalist liberal ideology, it moved to neoliberal monetarist ideology, with important consequences for relations between society and state. However, it was not at this time that the old liberal ideals of the minimal state were realized. Paradoxically, the new liberalizing order was not a project that could renounce the state; instead the state would move strongly on the macroeconomic level. This paper discusses ways in which fiscal and monetary policies implemented in Brazil after the Real Plan interfered in class relations and how they reveal a financial class character of the state. The fiscal policies analyzed are the release of federal government resource entitlements, the so-called fiscal responsibility and the figures of the primary and nominal fiscal results. In the context of monetary policy, I analyze the priority given to inflation control and the inflation targeting system as its means of control. The results show a picture of favoritism to the financial fraction of capital through such policies, which form, in whole, an institutional apparatus for the protection of credit and income which the finance respectively provides to and obtains from the state.
0	Previous research has explored in depth the fertility desires and intentions of women.  Yet, little is known about the fertility desires of men, and in particular, gay men.  Using nationally representative data from the 2002 and 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth, I examine men’s fertility preferences and intentions, including how these desires vary across race, class and sexuality groups, and whether the variation is similar for women.  Preliminary findings using 2002 data suggest education has a positive effect on men’s desires for children, when controlling for age.  Black and Hispanic men are more likely to want children than white men, and the effects of race vary by education and age.  In addition, sexual orientation is significant in predicting men’s fertility desires, in that men who identify as homosexual are much less likely to want children as compared with their heterosexual counterparts, perhaps due in part to the fact that homosexual men face greater barriers in achieving parenthood and have fewer models for parenting.  The final paper will also examine the effects of various measures of sexuality.  For example, preliminary analysis indicates there are portions of men who indicate a sexual attraction mostly or only to men, and women who are attracted mostly or only to women, who identify their sexual orientation as heterosexual.  This suggests that people understand their sexual identities in varying ways, which may play a role in how they conceptualize their fertility intentions and future family formation.
0	Early work on European immigrants showed a positive relationship between acculturation and a persons quality of life.  More recent work suggests a complex relationship between the two that challenges the traditional conception of acculturation as a one-dimensional construct, synonymous with assimilation and divorced from the concept of ethnic identity with which it is tightly bound theoretically and empirically.  Building on the work of Gans (1997) and Lieber, Chin, Nihira, & Mink (2001), this study has three goals: 1) to empirically test the two-dimensional approach to acculturation and ethnic identity formation (i.e., the identity reconciliation process) in an Hispanic immigrant community; 2) to test the previous socio-demographic findings in the quality of life literature with a sample of immigrants from a new destination community; and 3) to test the importance of neighborhood effects in determining perceived quality of life in immigrant communities.  A significant interaction effect is observed for acculturation and ethnic identity, but when the results are compared with the findings on neighborhood effects a paradox arises.  The contradiction between the negative effect of increased in-group contact and the positive effect of stronger ethnic identity is briefly discussed in context of the other significant findings.
1	Recent evidence indicates that contrary to some criminological theories, immigrants are less violent than native-born Americans. The relationship between immigrant status and reduced violence appears to hold at both the individual and neighborhood levels of analysis. This phenomenon has been referred to as the immigrant or Latino paradox. It has been suggested, although rarely examined, that cultural differences and strong social networks among immigrants account for their lower violence rates. These factors even appear strong enough to counterbalance the crime-promoting effects of economic disadvantage. This study investigates whether such patterns extend to intimate partner violence. Consistent with research on other forms of violence, we find that neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have lower levels of intimate partner violence. This relationship appears to be partially mediated by cultural norms and social ties.
1	Between 1945 and 2005, nation-states around the world revised their criminal laws on sexual activities. This global reform wave-across countries and domains of sexual activity-followed from the reconstitution of world models of society around individuals rather than corporate bodies. During the post-World War II period, this process rearranged the global cultural and organizational underpinnings of sex, eroding world-level support for criminal laws aimed at protecting collective entities-especially the family and the nation-and strengthening world support for laws aimed at protecting individualized persons. To make our case, we use unique cross-national and longitudinal data on the criminal regulation of rape, adultery, sodomy, and child sexual abuse. The data reveal striking counter-directional trends in sex-law reforms, which simultaneously elaborated regulations protecting individuals and dissolved laws protecting collective entities. World-level negative-binomial regression analyses and country-level event-history analyses confirm our main propositions. The findings demonstrate a sweeping revolution in criminal-sex laws, rooted in the intensified global celebration of free-standing personhood.
1	A growing literature reveals that parental divorce and marital discord can have undesirable effects on the mental health and social well-being of children, some of which extend well into adulthood. Our study augments this body of work by focusing on the interplay of divorce and discord in shaping the religious and spiritual lives of young adults. Several discrete subgroups of young adults are identified in terms of parental marital status and degree of parents marital conflict, and multiple religious and spiritual outcomes are considered. Data are taken from the National Survey on the Moral and Spiritual Lives of Young Adults from Divorced and Intact Families, a nationwide US telephone survey of approximately 1500 young adults ages 18-35 conducted in 2001. Findings confirm that persons raised by parents in intact, happy, low-conflict marriages tend to score higher on most religious and spiritual outcomes. However, offspring from divorced families and those from intact high-conflict families differ on some outcomes, but not others. Indicators of traditional institutional religious practices and beliefs appear more vulnerable to the effects of parental divorce and discord than personal spiritual beliefs and practices. Overall, findings reveal a rich but complex set of relationships between family background and religious and spiritual lives among young adults. 
1	"First proposed by Mueller, the theory of the ""rally effect"" predicts that public support for government officials will increase when an event occurs that (1) is international; (2) involves the United States; and (3) is specific, dramatic, and sharply focused [Mueller, J.E. 1973. War, Presidents, & Public Opinion. New York: John Wiley & Sons., p. 209]. Using the natural experiment of a large (N = 15,127) survey of young adults ages 18-27 that was in the field during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, we confirm the existence of a rally effect on trust in government as well as its subsequent decay. We then use a predictive modeling approach to investigate individual-level dynamics of rallying around the flag and anti-rallying in the face of the national threat. By disaggregating predictors of rallying, we demonstrate remarkably different patterns of response to the attacks based on sex and, particularly, race. The results confirm expectations of national threat inciting a rally effect, but indicate that the dynamics of this rally effect are complex and race and gender-dependent. The article offers previously-unavailable insights into the dynamics of rallying and trust in government. "
1	Using a data set of public and private relief spending for 295 cities, this article examines the racial and ethnic patterning of social welfare provision in the United States in 1929. On the eve of the Depression, cities with more blacks or Mexicans spent the least on social assistance and relied more heavily on private money to fund their programs. Cities with more European immigrants spent the most on relief and relied more heavily on public funding. Distinct political systems, labor market relations, and racial ideologies about each group's proclivity to use relief best explain relief spending differences across cities.
1	"Using data from the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN) 1977-2000, we examine sex segregation in a paradigmatic female-dominated occupation-nursing. We find that contrary to the vertical pattern of occupational stratification implied by the ""glass escalator,"" men are not disproportionately represented in administrative posts. Instead, we find a pervasive pattern of horizontal sex segregation, whereby men and women are disproportionately clustered in particular gendered specialties. Using in-depth interviews with a sample of registered nurses, we show that male nurses tend to gravitate toward areas of nursing they perceive to be more "" masculine."" Our findings have implications for other female-dominated occupations because the bottom-heavy structure of most occupations limits the number of men ( as well as women) from reaching the top positions within the field, meaning that horizontal sorting processes of acclimation sort most male employees in female-dominated professions."
0	This paper outlines a research proposal for the analysis of the state-by-state repeal of interracial marriage restrictions, and particularly the role of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1967 decision in this process.  Rosenberg (1991) argues that the Supreme Court actions are largely inconsequential to progress and social reform.  This proposal develops the repeal of interracial marriage restrictions as an important test case for Rosenberg's theory.  What happened at the state-level in the years leading up to and after the Supreme Court's 1967 decision declaring interracial marriage prohibitions unconstitutional?  Was this decision a key moment in ensuring the repeal of these laws in Southern states?  Alternatively, was Loving v. Virginia (1967) nothing more than a punctuation mark in the already advancing progress of state-level reforms?  This project has the potential to make three important contributions: update our knowledge on the history of state-by-state repeal of interracial marriage laws; confirm, modify or extend Rosenberg's thesis from The Hollow Hope; and provide valuable insights for contemporary activists who continue to work for social reforms.
1	In a departure from most studies of the causes of racial residential segregation that focus on the three main factors of economics, preferences, and discrimination, this paper examines one of the mechanisms through which segregation may be perpetuated: the housing search process itself. Data come from a 2004 face-to-face survey of an area probability sample of African American and white householders living in the three counties of the Detroit metropolitan area (n = 734). These data are used to address three research questions: (1) What are the strategies people use to find housing, and are there racial differences in those strategies? (2) Do whites and African Americans report similar or different experiences in the search for housing? (3) Do the locations in which people search for housing vary by race? Results show that once controlling for the type of search and background characteristics, the search strategies are generally similar for whites and blacks, though more so for buyers than renters: for example, black renters use more informal strategies and networks than do white renters. Analyses that look at the features of these strategies, however, reveal some significant racial differences. Search experiences are similar in terms of length and number of homes inspected, but other objective and subjective questions about the search show blacks at a disadvantage compared to whites: African Americans submit more offers/applications for homes, report more difficulties, and are much more likely to feel they were taken advantage of during the search. The racial characteristics of the communities in which blacks and whites search are quite different: whites mainly search in white communities, while African Americans search in communities with a variety of racial compositions. The paper concludes with a call for further research on housing search strategies, with particular attention to the role of social networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	What do recent trends toward increasingly ambitious educational expectations and rising college completion rates mean for the stratification of higher education? This article shows that the odds of achieving expectations for a bachelor's degree increased across 15 cohorts of young adults, and to a lesser extent, for expectations to attend graduate/professional school. Gender-related constraints on realizing expectations for a bachelor's degree weakened, while constraints associated with minority racial/ethnic and lower socioeconomic statuses did not. Recent trends in educational stratification were thus a mixture of fulfilled expectations for growing proportions of some young adults, but continued social constraints for many others. Note, these results are derived from the experiences of high school seniors successfully reinterviewed over time, who are advantaged relative to school dropouts and nonrespondents.
1	This study investigates the changing racial diversity and structure of metropolitan neighborhoods. We consider three alternative perspectives about localized racial change: that neighborhoods are bifurcating along a white/nonwhite color line, fragmenting into homogeneous enclaves, or integrating white, black, Latino, and Asian residents into diverse residential environments. To assess hypotheses drawn from these perspectives, we develop a hybrid methodology (incorporating the entropy index and majority-rule criteria) that offers advantages over previous typological efforts. Our analysis of 1990-2000 census tract data for the 100 largest US metropolitan areas finds that most neighborhoods are becoming more diverse and that members of all groups have experienced increasing exposure to neighborhood diversity. However, white populations tend to diminish rapidly in the presence of multiple minority groups and there has been concomitant white growth in low-diversity neighborhoods. Latino population dynamics have emerged as a primary force driving neighborhood change in a multi-group context. 
0	An increasing body of evidence suggests that the division of domestic tasks varies systematically across socio-political contexts, but we are only beginning to unravel the mechanisms by which this occurs.  Using longitudinal data and following couples marrying between 1990 and 1995 in the former East and West regions of Germany, we find evidence of direct, indirect and residual policy effects across the regions, and that the negotiation of the division of childcare appears qualitatively different than that for other domestic tasks.  For domestic tasks, time availability and womens relative resources prove significant, and a residual policy effect remains after controlling for these such that East German men perform a greater share than West German men.  For childcare, time availability is significant, but only for men and East German women, and wives greater earnings predict a decrease, rather than increase, in fathers share. There are no residual policy effects.  These findings further our understanding of how the state shapes, rather than simply reflects, societal gender hierarchies.
0	"This paper will illustrate how and why sexual harassment has been constructed as a social problem in Japan. In 1999, the Equal Employment Opportunity Law (EEOL) amended the employer's responsibility to create a ""sexual harassment free"" work environment in Japan. Sekuhara (a Japanese coined word for sexual harassment) received tremendous national attention with the Fukuoka case  a landmark case for sexual harassment in 1989. Japanese society understood sekuhara as a social issue by the time the EEOL included the employer responsibility for sexual harassment. The legal amendment, however, came not only with an increasing social awareness, but also with an international pressure to improve womens status. For instance, since the first passage of the EEOL in 1985, Japan has reformed the EEOL as the Convention for Elimination for all the forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) pressured for change. Interestingly during the same time, the national media covered sexual harassment scandals caused by Japanese firms operating in the United States. How have these influences from outside shaped Japanese understanding of sexual harassment? I will use sekuhara as a case to investigate how Japanese has shaped their gender culture. Drawing examples from the cases in the U.S., I intend to illustrate legal and social definitions of sexual harassment, as well as, social responses to the issue in Japan."
1	In most families today, childcare remains divided unequally between fathers and mothers. Scholars argue that persistence of the gendered division of childcare is due to multiple causes, including values about gender and family, disparities in paid work, class, and social context. It is likely that all of these factors interact, but to date researchers have not explored such interactions. To address this gap, we analyze nationally representative time-use data from Australia, Denmark, France, and Italy. These countries have different employment patterns, social and family policies, and cultural attitudes toward parenting and gender equality. Using data from matched married couples, we conduct a cross-national study of mothers' and fathers' relative time in childcare, divided along dimensions of task (i.e., routine versus non-routine activities) and co-presence (i.e., caring for children together as a couple versus caring solo). Results show that mothers' and fathers' work arrangements and education relate modestly to shares of childcare, and this relationship differs across countries. We find cross-national variation in whether more equal shares result from the behavior of mothers, fathers, or both spouses. Results illustrate the relevance of social context in accentuating or minimizing the impact of individual- and household-level characteristics.
0	The impact of military service on the status attainment of World War II veterans has been studied since the 1950s; however, the research has failed to come to any consensus with regard to their level of attainment. Analyses have focused on cross-sectional or longitudinal data without considering the effects of service over the life course. We argue that World War II veterans had greater attainment, measured in terms of education, income, and occupational prestige, over their lifetimes; and that black World War II veterans attained more than white World War II veterans relative to their non-veteran peers. We use census data from the 1950 through 2000 Public Use Microdata Sample. Military service afforded White veterans significant advantages through their early and middle working years; however, their non-veteran peers eventually did catch up. Black veterans attained more social status than their non-veteran peers throughout their lives.
1	According to behavioral genetics research, the intergenerational correlation in weight derives solely from shared genetic predispositions, but complete genetic determinism contradicts the scientific consensus that social and behavioral change underlies the modern obesity epidemic. To address this conundrum, this article utilizes sibling data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and extends structural equation sibling models to incorporate siblings' genetic relationships in order to explore the role of families' social characteristics for adolescent weight. The article is the first to demonstrate that the association between parents' obesity and adolescent weight is both social and genetic. Furthermore, by incorporating genetic information, the shared and social origins of the correlation between inactivity and weight are better revealed.
0	We use data from a two-wave survey of rural youth to examine the role and significance of socioeconomic status (SES), and family, school, and community attachments in the stress process. We test the extent to which the above social attachments explain or condition the effects of SES and stressful life events on two outcomes: depressed mood and overweight status. Results reveal that, compared to high-SES youth, low-SES youth are more depressed and overweight. Stressful life events mediate partly the relation between SES and depressed mood; yet, stress does not affect the SES-overweight relationship. Community attachment explains partly the SES-depressed mood link, and self-esteem explains partly the SES-overweight link. Net of personal resources (self-esteem, the sense of mastery, and the assertion of autonomy), family attachment buffers the harmful effects of SES on depressed mood. Based on our results, we recommend that health policies and practices consider the importance of social attachments for youth well-being.
1	The Washington State Achiever (WSA) program was a large-scale educational intervention of scholarships, mentoring, and school redesign designed to encourage students from moderate and low income families to attend college in Washington State. Using a quasi-experimental design based on pre- and post-intervention surveys of high school seniors in program and non-program schools, we find a significant WSA effect on educational outcomes, net of the demographic and socioeconomic composition of students across schools. Across the three intervention high schools, the program is strongly significant in one school, significant after a lag in another school, and not significant in a third. We speculate about the potential reasons for the differential program effect across high schools. 
1	We develop and test a new hypothesis about how the race of a college freshman's roommate affects the racial composition of the student's ego network. Together, three principles of social structure proximity, homophily, and transitivity logically imply that college students assigned a roommate of a given race will have more friends (other than their roommate) of that race than will students assigned a roommate not of that race. A test with data collected from 195 white freshmen at Stanford University in the spring of 2002 supports this prediction. Our analysis advances earlier work by predicting and providing evidence of race-specific effects: While students assigned a different-race roommate of a given race have more friends (other than their roommate) of their roommate's race, they do not have more different-race friends not of their roommate's race. 
1	"The study of institutional myths has been central to organizational sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of education for 30 years. This article examines how the myth concept has been used and develops neglected possibilities by asking: What happens when myths become incarnate, and how does this occur? In other words, what happens when conformity to a rationalized cultural ideal such as ""accountability'' is no longer symbolic but is given tangible flesh? Data from a two-year ethnography of an urban elementary school provide answers and reveal ""recoupling'' processes through which institutional myths and organizational practices that were once loosely connected become tightly linked. In the school studied here, recoupling accountability with classroom practices created a phenomenon that teachers labeled ""turmoil.'' The findings advance our understanding of the micro-sociological foundations of institutional theory by ""inhabiting'' institutionalism with people, their work activities, social interactions, and meaning-making processes."
0	Recent case study evidence on schools that are successfully educating poor and minority children suggests that a key ingredient of success may be teachers’ sense of agency to overcome hardships in students’ lives. If this is true, teachers’ attitudes of helplessness to overcome students’ social disadvantage may be a missing link in explaining teacher quality and may also pose a significant barrier to broader implementation of “gap-closing” school reform. This paper explores teachers’ beliefs about their capacity to influence student achievement in the face of social disadvantage using the newly-released High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, which contains data on math and science teachers in a nationally representative sample of schools. I examine the prevalence of these beliefs and how they relate to teacher characteristics that are typically employed to measure teacher quality. I also analyze how school characteristics relate to teacher beliefs of helplessness or agency, with particular attention to school diversity and implications for achievement disparities. The paper contributes to a broader understanding of the importance of teacher beliefs and attitudes, particularly the perspective that believing in students’ potential is critical to their success. Understanding whether teachers’ beliefs are systematically related to other teacher traits and school contexts is important for assessing the implications of case study evidence that emphasizes teacher attitudes and school culture as central to school reform. The paper therefore contributes to identifying whether beliefs are an overlooked—or potentially overhyped—aspect of teacher effectiveness.
0	ABSTRACT:  Understanding neighborhood emergence, stability, and change is an important goal in the study of social stratification.  The neighborhoods people live in affect their quality of life, future life chances, and how they are judged by others (e.g., Wilson 1996, Bourgois 2003).  Thomas Schelling (1971) proposed a model of neighborhood self-organization in which agents search for neighborhoods with some proportion of similar agents.  In Schellings model, agents choose neighborhoods based on their desirability, while Schelling assumes that all neighborhoods are equally accessible.  This contrasts sharply with observed patterns, in which the most desirable neighborhoods are often the least accessible and agents income tethers their residential aspirations.  I relax Schellings assumption of perfect accessibility in a simple wealth and status-based model of residential choice.  The cost and desirability of neighborhoods is based on the wealth and status of nearby agents.  Agents stochastically search the lattice for the most desirable cell they can afford.  I manipulate the affordability of housing and the distribution of wealth, measuring the effect of these variables on residential self-organization.  Findings include a non-linear effect of affordability on class segregation, as well as suburbanization-like patterns showing dense central clusters of poor agents surrounded by rings of wealthier agents.
1	In industrialized nations, sibship size generally depresses educational attainment: the larger the number of siblings, the lower the educational attainment. This association is much less consistent in developing nations, however. This article examines the effect that the number of siblings has on educational attainment in China, a nation that has experienced sharp vacillations between policies designed to promote equality (between urban and rural residents and between men and women) and policies designed to promote economic development. The implementation of these policies in the educational arena has alternately reduced and increased competition for educational resources and, as we show, has correspondingly reduced and increased the effect of sibship size on educational attainment.
1	"We capitalize on inter- and intra-state variation in state welfare rules regarding new immigrants to simulate a ""natural experiment"" that provides evidence on the impact of post-reform welfare (TANF) participation on immigrant women's economic self-sufficiency. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (1996-1999 and 2001-2003 panels) and textual data on state welfare rules. we examine three measures of economic well-being - employment. employment stability, and wage trajectories - to obtain a comprehensive picture of immigrants' post-welfare experiences. Findings suggest that immigrant TANF-leavers are no more or less likely to be employed than either TANF-eligible (but not receiving) or TANF-ineligible immigrant women (statistical and natural control groups, respectively). However, given employment. TANF-leavers have substantially longer spells of stable employment and steeper wage trajectories than immigrant women in both control groups. "
0	The United States military has a “zero tolerance” policy toward sexual harassment and sexual violence.  Despite the existence of these policies, the military continues to produce high rates of both sexual harassment and sexual violence.  We argue that this paradox exists because the military is a masculinized institution that has been organized to promote specific ideals of masculinity. We also argue that although the entire U.S. Military participates in the construction of a masculine identity, it is not monolithic; there are variations across military contexts, producing significant differences in rates of sexual violence.  This paper will explore the varying rates of sexual violence against women in the military, explaining the different rates of violence through an analysis of the shifting significance of the military’s combat masculine warrior ideal across varying contextual and individual factors.
1	We extend research on black-white gaps in the subjective quality of life by exploring recent General Social Survey data, focusing attention on Latinos, and probing the value of partial proportional odds models for ordinal quality-of-life measures. Results indicate a declining but discernable black-white gap for four measures-marital happiness, overall happiness, health status and trust-and the persistence of a gap for another-satisfaction with finances. Although Latinos as a whole have a lower quality of life than non-Latinos, significant differences between Mexican-origin Latinos and those from other countries emerge for only two quality-of-life measures, overall happiness and financial satisfaction. The partial proportional odds models overcome technical problems common to the analysis of ordinal dependent variables and establish both the magnitude and location of inequalities.
1	The link between migration and STD/HIV risky sexual behavior has been well documented. Research of risky sexual behavior that addresses the issue of gender-migration interaction or employs a multilevel perspective is still limited in China. Using data from a probability survey and applying multilevel modeling, this paper examines gender differences in (1) the link between migration and risky sexual behavior and (2) individual and community correlates of risky sexual behavior. Results suggest significant interaction between gender and migration. Being a temporary migrant is associated with significantly more risky sexual behaviors for females but significantly fewer for males. There are also significant interactions between gender and marriage and living arrangement. Being married and living with others both appear to be more powerful deterrents to risky sexual behavior for females than for males. Single migrant women who live alone have the most risky sexual behaviors while married nonmigrant women who live with others have the least. Risky sexual behavior is further influenced by family and peers and conditioned by community contexts. Prevention programs are urgently needed for female temporary migrants and must address the issue of gender and pay attention to social influences of family and peers and community contexts.
0	Shotgun marriage – in which a marital union occurred post-conception but pre-birth – has largely disappeared from the family formation landscape. Here, we identify a new type of relationship that may have supplanted shotgun marriage: shotgun cohabitation, in which couples began cohabiting after conception but prior to the birth. We use data from the first ten rounds of the National Longitudinal Survey 1997 (NLS97) to analyze household relationship types at the time of a first birth. We find that 12% of parents are in a shotgun cohabitation relationship, compared to 6% in a shotgun marriage. Shotgun cohabitations also account for nearly one-quarter of all unions. Contrary to expectations, relationships which began as a result of a pregnancy were not more likely to dissolve than relationships that did not. However, both shot-gun cohabitations and cohabitations that existed before a birth dissolved much faster than both types of marriages.
1	Are children's statements about their futures related to outcomes in middle age? In 1966 almost 13,500 children ages 12-13 were asked whether they thought their futures would be worse, similar or better as compared to others of their own age. It was shown that children with low, and surprisingly high, expectations did suffer from increased mortality, economic hardship and weak labor market attachment risks in middle age. Although it cannot be ruled out that expectations worked as self-fulfilling prophesies, the analyses showed that expectations essentially reflected facts known to the children (i.e., upbringing conditions and their own abilities and achievements).
0	Individuals who attain higher education, whereas both their parents did not, embody the realization of intergenerational educational mobility. They are referred to as first-generation higher education students. Previous analyses have often portrayed them as succeeding despite their family background. This research suggests that despite the many challenges they face, the families of first-generation students are often facilitators of their success. Data were drawn from the National Educational Longitudinal Study 88/2000. Only individuals whose parents had not attained post-secondary education were selected, and comparison was drawn between the ones who had become first in their families to attain higher education and those who had not (N=7,040).  The analysis reveals that breaking the intergenerational cycle of educational level inheritance requires a family investment that prioritizes education through non-material resources on a daily basis – an investment that I conceptualized as family capital. A better understanding of this contribution is valuable for developing an efficient policy.
0	Communities affected by environmental health concerns frequently request health studies from their local or state departments of public health. Such studies are challenging to design and execute, and often return inconclusive findings. Activists and community stakeholders are often unhappy with or frustrated with the response. This study grows out of a project designed to improve communication among stakeholders typically involved in health studies: community residents, activists, public health officials and scientists.  Three focus groups were conducted with residents of two communities north of Boston, Massachusetts that had recent experience with health studies. Findings suggest that participants struggle to reconcile their direct experience of tangible evidence of environmental health with the findings of studies that contradict their experience of exposure and illness. Tangible evidence influences not only perceptions of environmental quality but also the veracity of studies conducted to assess environmental health. Additionally, dynamics of trust and power influence how residents may respond to the findings of a health study. Taken together, tangible evidence, trust, and power influence the expectations a community has for how a health study should optimally be conducted, especially with respect to the degree of community involvement, and with respect to the types of data they find acceptable.
0	Few social science researchers examine how long people expect to live.  Using the fifth wave of the Harlem Longitudinal Study of Urban Black Youth 1993-1994, I explore the extent to which established predictors of subjective life expectancy, identified in white and mixed-race samples, predict subjective longevity among African-Americans living in an urban area.  The analysis reveals that some established predictors, such as health are associated with subjective life expectancy for this sample.  However, other predictors such as socioeconomic status are not associated with how long African-Americans expect to live.  Additionally, I examine unexplored predictors of subjective life expectancy.  I find that the size of the network and the proximity of friends have positive associations with subjective life expectancy while some measures of social strain have a negative relationship with how long people expect to live.
1	Research has extensively examined matching on race and other characteristics in cohabitation and marriage, but it has generally disregarded sexual and romantic relationships. Using data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine the tempo of key transitions in the recent relationships of young adults ages 18-24. We focus on how the racial mix of partners in relationships is associated with the timing of sex, cohabitation and marriage. We find evidence that relationships between white men and minority women proceed more rapidly from romance to sexual involvement and from sexual involvement to cohabitation compared to relationships involving other racial combinations. Our findings have important implications for social exchange perspectives on mate selection.
1	Export-only diffusion occurs when innovators do not adopt an innovation themselves, but rather promote it to others for adoption. Potential adopters do not take their cues from early adopters, but rather from diffusion professionals who make it their job to spread a practice or institution. The global spread of national-level, population-control policies during the Cold War is one such instance: developed and promoted by wealthy countries that did not themselves adopt such policies, they came to be widespread among poorer countries, thanks in large part to the mobilization of diffusion professionals. This article offers an analytical account of this diffusion, as well as an event-history analysis of 163 countries over the period 1950-1990 demonstrating the importance of linkages between policy adopters and the non-adopting institutions of diffusion professionals.
1	Current theories in the sociology of emotions posit contradictory expectations regarding the relationship between status and the relative experience of anger, with some predicting a negative relationship and others proposing a positive one. We test the compatibility of these opposing hypotheses by examining the relationship between anger and a key dimension of socioeconomic status the occupational status score of an individual's occupation for a representative sample of Americans. We connect different strands of theory and research in the social psychology of emotions to posit a non-linear relationship between occupational status and the experience of anger. Analyses of data from the 1996 General Social Survey's emotions module (N = 1460) are consistent with this integrative account. Individuals located at the two opposite ends of the status and prestige hierarchy are more likely to experience anger than those of middle status. We use insight from Blau's macro-structural theory to help elucidate this complex relationship.
0	"Dr. Moore has made a major contribution to the social sciences in the area of crime, drugs and gangs. No scholar is as widely cited as is Dr. Joan Moore in this field.  She has numerous articles, book chapters, and books in this area. Her two books Homeboy: Gangs, Drugs and Prison in the Barrios of Los Angeles (Temple University Press, 1979) and Going Down to the Barrio (Temple University Press, 1992) are widely respected for their insights into Mexican American gangs. Homeboys is considered by many a ""classic"" in this field. More recently, her ""Drug Posses, Gangs and the Underclass in Milwaukee"" study  focuses on the African American community.  Methodologically these studies expand the Chicago  School's community  research  approach  by  incorporating actual gang members into the research team. More importantly, Dr. Moore's findings have provided important theoretical insights into deviance and social problems."
0	Recent research indicates that nearly one in five workers is now engaged in working something other than a fixed daytime schedule. Moreover, one in five mothers of pre-school age children work night or evening shifts. This paper examines how married and unmarried parents who have nonstandard work schedules perceive their parenting responsibilities. Using data from Wave I of the National Survey of Families and Households, results show that shift workers are more likely than day workers to have lower wages and lower levels of job satisfaction. Parents who work nonstandard shifts are also significantly more likely to report being dissatisfied with their parenting responsibilities than those who work the day shift, regardless of their marital status. These findings suggest that shift work is a choice born of economic necessity rather than, as some suggest, an opportunity to balance work and family.
1	Racial threat scholars have long argued that racial prejudice is motivated by threat. This literature identifies two types of threat: individual threat and group threat; however, actual arguments tend to focus on only one of the two types of threat. Consequently, there has been no assessment of whether both threats are simultaneously associated with prejudice. This paper uses data from the 1994 General Social Survey (GSS) to examine the relationship between perceptions of individual threat, perceptions of group threat, and opposition to policies aiding blacks. Results from multinomial logits demonstrate that both threats are associated with opposition to race-equalizing policies, suggesting that single-threat theories should be reevaluated and that studies incorporating racial threat should include both types of threat.

0	A major objective of the Affordable Care Act passed in March 2010 is to ensure access to care for millions of uninsured Americans.  This paper expands on existing work, which finds differential patterns of insurance coverage and access to healthcare based on race and ethnicity or nativity. I examine inequities in health access for children across immigrant generations for four major U.S. racial/ethnic groups, testing explanations of racial differences, generational differences and the interaction of the two.  Using data from the 2007 National Survey of Child Health, I discuss patterns of health care access among children that differ by race/ethnicity and immigrant generational status.  More time in the country (across generations) does not mean equal increases in likelihood of access for the children of all groups.  Multivariate regression models test to what extent these patterns may be explained.  This paper expands on factors that may account for differences in access starting with characteristics commonly assessed in the literature such as: age, income, parents education, language spoken in the home, family structure, work status, and adding receipt of government aid.  With the growing number of children of immigrants in the United States, this project establishes a crucial baseline on equity of access by which to evaluate implementation of future health care reform.
0	In 1996 Walmart established its first retail store in China. Since then it has grown to 71 retail outlets in 34 cities throughout the country, employing over 36,000 workers. China has for over a decade been Walmarts foremost supplier of manufactured goods, importing products from subcontracted factories employing the sweated labor of young migrant women. It is now poised to become Chinas largest retailer, with a bid to purchase Trustmart, a Taiwanese retail chain with 200 stores in China. As it faces restrictions on growth in the U.S., Walmart is taking its everyday low prices on the road, eyeing China as its next major retail market. Walmart has especially focused its expansion in Chinas western regions, where economic growth has been relatively slow.  This paper examines the effects on employees of multiple strategies used by the retailer to minimize labor costs and maximize efficiency. The paper is based upon participant observation research conducted in a Walmart retail outlet in Kunming, a southwestern Chinese city that is host to four Walmart stores. Two major strategies will be explored for their impact on the retail shopfloor labor regime. First I examine the externalization of labor supply in two forms: the use of vendors as a source of shopfloor sales labor and the use of a cleaning agency for its custodial services. Second, I investigate the rationalization and perpetual speed-up of cashiering among workers directly employed by the retailer. The paper argues that the use of surveillance and information technology replaces the direct observation of managers as a tactic of despotic control. In this labor regime customers are unwittingly recruited to partake in the direct control of employees. Work on the Walmart retail shopfloor takes on the cast of an assembly-line.
0	Data from the Association of American Medical Colleges 2004 Graduation Questionnaire are utilized to predict the odds of entering different medical specialties. The data suggest women still face inequality in entering the medical profession. Controlling for educational debt, type of medical school attended, and race/ethnicity, women are more likely than men to enter specialties like psychiatry, pediatrics or dermatology, and obstetrics and gynecology, but less likely to enter the prestigious field of surgery. Furthermore, doctors that reported mistreatment in medical school were more likely to enter psychiatry and much less likely to enter surgery than those that did not report mistreatment. Suggestions for future research are provided.
0	The labor, environmental, economic, and health consequences of globalization have been well documented. Less clear are the ways in which the same forces of globalization that expose more and more people around the world to environmental health risks are also creating new networks of environmental health activists that link local health social movement struggles to a global network of environmental health activism. This paper reports on research into the roles transnational environmental movement organizations play in local and national campaigns. By examining three campaigns in India and one campaign in Vietnam, I attempt to illustrate how strategies and resources available at the local level influence the relationships that emerge between local and transnational environmental organizations.
1	While much research has documented the pattern and extent of sex segregation of workers once they are employed, few studies have addressed the pre-hire mechanisms that are posited to produce sex segregation in employment. While the notion of a labor queue-the rank order of the set of people that employers choose among-plays a prominent role in pre-hire accounts of job sex sorting mechanisms, few studies have examined the ways in which job candidates are sorted into labor queues. In this paper, we explore the mechanisms by which labor queues contribute to the gendering of jobs by studying the hiring process for all jobs at a call center. Being placed in a queue has a clear gendering effect on the hiring process: the sex distribution of applicants who are matched to queues and those who are rejected at this phase diverge, and among those assigned to queues, women are prevalent in queues for low pay, low status jobs. The screening process also contributes to the gendering of the population of hires at this firm. Females are more prevalent among hires than they are among candidates at initial queue assignment. Among high status jobs, however, males are more prevalent than females. Moreover, there are important wage implications associated with matching to queues. While there are large between-queue sex differences in the paid wages associated with allocation to queues, once allocated to queues the wage differences between male and female candidates are nil. Consequently, the roots of gender wage inequality in this setting lie in the initial sorting of candidates to labor queues. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	Despite the proliferation of scholarship on sexual citizenship, there is a surprising amount of silence on both age and race in the literature.  This essay argues that the exclusion of racialized and teenage subjects not only exacerbates the marginalization of these (often overlapping) groups but also renders existing critiques and alternative visions of sexual citizenship insufficient.  By situating teenage sexual subjectivities at the center of an intersectional theory of sexual citizenship, critical citizenship theorists can not only better account for the normalizing discourses of racialized heterosexism, but also begin to theorize teenage sexual citizenship across multiple and intersecting dimensions of difference.
0	Ingleharts thesis of postmaterial value change is one of the most influential accounts of social and political change in advanced Western nations. This paper uses data from the World Values Survey and the Australian Election Surveys to reexamine the relationship between age and values in 19 advanced industrial nations. We find evidence of a monotonic age structuring of values in a number of countries, but in others, the relationship between age and values is not as Inglehart would predict. In addition, the impact of birth cohort on values differs between countries that are dominated by two major parties and those where there are many smaller parties. The presence of successful Green parties is also important for enhancing the uptake of postmaterialist values. These findings suggest that Ingleharts arguments about generational value change should be modified to take into account national political institutions and political cultures that might enhance or impede generational-based values change.
0	Although previous research has documented the importance of reciprocity for cooperation and solidarity, the questions of whether and how reciprocity can bring about and sustain equality in groups have been largely ignored. This study contributes to the literature by investigating the extent and ways in which the aggregation of reciprocated relations and the structuring of unreciprocated relations determine the distribution of benefits in a large-scale social system. The paper develops a simple theoretical model and shows how that model can be applied to the analysis of the global network of hospitality exchanges based on the online social service CouchSurfing.org.
0	This paper examines one application of Randall Collins Interaction Ritual Chain theory.The analysis of the qualitative interview as an interaction ritual chain is useful for both methodologists, who may gain insights into the successful completion of in depth interviews, as well as theorists looking to expand the implications of Collins' work.  This paper is paper is based on a case study of in depth interviews conducted with homeless youth in a shelter during the summer of 2005.  I examine both successful and unsuccessful interviews in light of the theory and examine how interaction ritual chains are useful ground for advancing method and theory.
0	This paper provokes a feminist reconsideration of the body through an analysis of two lifestyle pharmaceuticals developed with the express purpose to limit the total number of menstrual cycles in a womans life-cycle.  Despite the shared goal of limiting menstrual flow, the two drug companies analyzed here conceptualize menstruation and womens bodies differently.  Seasonale® a birth control pill which women take continuously with four breaks for menstruation a year  frames menstruation as a hindrance to daily life and something to be overcome while Balance Pharmaceuticals, Inc., frames menstruation as a danger to womens health through risky exposure to hormones.  In this paper, we use these two positions as a means to theorize pharmaceutical lifestyle drugs and raise questions about the material and discursive limits of the body.
1	American educational leaders and philosophers have long valued schooling for its role in preparing the nation's youth to be civically engaged citizens. Numerous studies have found a positive relationship between education and subsequent civic participation. However, little is known about possible variation in effects by selection into higher education, a critical omission considering education's expressed role as a key mechanism for integrating disadvantaged individuals into civic life. I disaggregate effects and examine whether civic returns to higher education are largest for disadvantaged low likelihood or advantaged high likelihood college goers. I find evidence for significant effect heterogeneity: civic returns to college are greatest among individuals who have a low likelihood for college completion. Returns decrease as the propensity for college increases.
0	Many studies on the ordering of transition events focus on social-historical determinants. However, few researchers have investigated the impact of psychological factors. Using Banduras self-efficacy theory in the life-course framework, the present study examines the mutual influences between self-efficacy and the ordering of schooling, work, and family formation during the transition to adulthood. The present study makes use of a sub-sample of 386 young people from the first two waves (1987/1988, 1992/1994) of National Survey of Family and Household (NSFH). Research findings indicate that baseline self-efficacy (T1) has no independent effect on the ordering of transition events. Instead, baseline self-efficacys (T1) effect on the ordering of transition events is conditional on gender, and the interaction effect is moderately statistically significant. With respect to the effect of the ordering of transition events on individuals self-efficacy at wave 2 (T2), it was found that the ordering of transition events is statistically associated with individuals subsequent self-efficacy (T2). Further analysis shows that the effect of the ordering of the transition events on self-efficacy (T2) depends upon individuals baseline self-efficacy (T1).
0	In his classic discourse, Weber (1978c) introduces, defines and discusses three legitimate forms of domination: legal (rational), traditional and charismatic. This paper explores the possibility of a fourth legitimate form. I place each of the three established forms into a dual dichotomy that simultaneously incorporates high and low levels of formalization and recognition. The potential for a fourth type is then evaluated by filling the empty cell in that dual dichotomy with innovation. Following Webers discussion of the transitory nature of his established forms, the place of this fourth type in that progression is then found. To establish the legitimacy and existence of this fourth form, examples are provided both from current literature and from arenas to which Weber had access. Additionally, the paper addresses potential reasons for the exclusion of this form from Webers initial treatise.
1	"Firms that do not fit into established business categories tend to be overlooked, but new markets often form around these ""misfits."" Because being seen as part of a growing population makes new populations seem real, counting them is important to mainstreaming new markets. Yet, if firms outside the mainstream are overlooked, how can they be counted? Extending the embeddedness perspective to social cognition about markets, this research exposes the media central role in market formation. Using a new method for extracting data about market networks from media coverage, this study demonstrates that early entrants benefit,from inviting coverage that makes a few-but not too many-links to other entrants, thus helping audiences perceive an emerging category. As the market matures, however references to rivals become unhelpful. These findings illustrate the value of a linguistic turn to empirical studies of meaning construction and the reification of social structure."
1	Although research finds high rates of risky sexual and drug related behavior among homeless young people, little research had examined how the characteristics of their social networks encourage or constrain risky behaviors. Based on a sample of 145 homeless young adults in the Midwestern United States, results revealed that having used alcohol with at least one of their network members and the presence of more conflict was associated with engaging in a greater number of sexual risk taking behaviors. Correlates of engaging in a greater number of substance use related behaviors included having older peers within the network, having used illicit drugs with at least one network member, and the presence of more conflict. The presence of a family member in one's network, however, was associated with fewer sexual and drug related risk behaviors. Overall, the social network characteristics of youth explained significant, additional variance beyond that of youth's own characteristics and their early family histories. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1	This study examined whether the transition into adolescence, proxied by pubertal timing, shaped the transition into adulthood, proxied by union formation behaviors, among contemporary American women. In a sample drawn from Add Health (n = 7,523), early maturing girls reported an accelerated transition to marriage and cohabitation in young adulthood, net of family structure history, academic achievement in high school, and parental education. The link between pubertal timing and cohabitation was strongest among socioeconomically advantaged women; no socio-economic differences were identified for marriage. The tendency for early maturers to have more pronounced romantic orientations during adolescence partially explained their transitions to marriage. In all, the persistence of the pubertal timing effect into young adulthood suggests that early maturers accelerated entrance into the romantic market in adolescence has a cascading, long-term impact on the shape of their lives in young adulthood.
1	Expectation states theory employs several scope statements to specify the situational conditions that must be met for any test of the theory to be considered valid (Foschi, 1997). Collective orientation and task orientation are two scope conditions that researchers frequently implement as selection criteria for a participant's inclusion in an analytic sample. Although excluding participants who fail to meet scope conditions is theoretically consistent, researchers have yet to establish how this practice affects experimental outcomes. I employ meta-analysis to compare studies within the expectation states tradition in which participants are excluded for failure to meet scope conditions to studies in which no similar exclusions are made. Results suggest that studies that exclude participants for scope violations demonstrate a decreased baseline tendency to reject influence. I contend that adopting a more universal approach to the measurement and application of scope conditions would be methodologically and theoretically beneficial to expectation states research. 
0	This study aims to assess the state of the boundaries between the fields of restricted and large-scale film production over time and in various national contexts. This is done through an analysis of the types of film that received attention in elite newspapers in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States between 1955 and 2005. We hypothesize that the fields of restricted and large-scale film production – to varying degrees - have become more intertwined in all four countries and that this shows in the amount of attention French, German, Dutch and American film critics pay to artistic and/or commercial film products. The main research question is: How and to what extent does the alleged shifting of the boundaries between the restricted and large-scale fields of film production between 1955 and 2005 appear in the film criticism published in French, German, Dutch and U.S. newspapers?
1	Migration and stratification are increasingly intertwined. One day soon it will be impossible to understand one without the other. Both focus on life chances. Stratification is about differential life chances - who gets what and why - and migration is about improving life chances - getting more of the good things of life. To examine the interconnections of migration and stratification, we address a mix of old and new questions, carrying out analyses newly enabled by a unique new data set on recent legal immigrants to the United States (the New Immigrant Survey). We look at immigrant processing and lost documents, depression due to the visa process, presentation of self, the race-ethnic composition of an immigrant cohort (made possible by the data for the first time since 1961), black immigration from Africa and the Americas, skin color diversity among couples formed by US citizen sponsors and immigrant spouses, and English fluency among children age 8-12 and their immigrant parents. We find, inter alia, that children of previously illegal parents are especially more likely to be fluent in English, that native-born US citizen women tend to marry darker, that immigrant applicants who go through the visa process while already in the United States are more likely to have their documents lost and to suffer visa depression, and that immigration, by introducing accomplished black immigrants from Africa (notably via the visa lottery), threatens to overturn racial and skin color associations with skill. Our analyses show the mutual embeddedness of migration and stratification in the unfolding of the immigrants' and their children's life chances and the impacts on the stratification structure of the United States. 
1	This study evaluates the empirical merits of a multilevel model of English language proficiency among immigrants. The model represents a synthesis of Blau's theory of intergroup relations and the human capital model. Hypotheses derived from the model were tested using multilevel ordinal logistic analysis with individual and aggregate data from the 2000 U.S. Census for members of 20 non-English language groups. The results lent strong support to predictions derived from Blau's theory. As expected, immigrants' English proficiency was affected negatively by group size and segregation, and positively by linguistic heterogeneity and inequality between fluent and poor English speakers of foreign origin. In addition, individual factors also exerted significant effects on English fluency as predicted by the human capital model.
1	"A quarter century ago, an important finding in stratification research showed that the intergenerational occupational association was much weaker among college graduates than among those with lower levels of education. This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the ""meritocratic power"" of a college degree. Drawing on five longitudinal data sets, the author analyzes intergenerational mobility in terms of class, occupational status, earnings, and household income for men and women. Findings indicate that the intergenerational association is strong among those with low educational attainment; it weakens or disappears among bachelor's degree holders but reemerges among those with advanced degrees, leading to a U-shaped pattern of parental influence. Educational and labor market factors explain these differences in mobility: parental resources influence college selectivity, field of study, and earnings more strongly for advanced-degree holders than for those with a bachelor's degree alone."
0	Recent international surveys in the sociology of work have generally identified the following three themes: 1) economic globalization, the advent of neo-liberalism, and the restructuring of bureaucracy; 2) the shift from a manufacturing economy to a service economy; and 3) social inequality, the rise of identity politics, and the fates of old and new social movements.  The purpose of this paper is to extend the geographical coverage of recent international surveys of the sociology of work on these three global political-economic trends.  Towards this end, we review 32 European, Australian, South Asian, East Asian, and Latin American journals between the years 2000 and 2004.  Our review reveals a cornucopia of research dealing with the three aforementioned themes.  In particular we find a strong current of research on the impact of bureaucratic restructuring on worker livelihoods in East Asia; the effects of labor outsourcing in South Asian and Australian on workplace relations; the impact of globalization, marketization, and privatization on worker livelihoods in post-Communist European nations; and the revitalization of labor movements across all geographic regions.
0	A closer examination of the WTO and the particular ways in which the TRIPS Agreement has been interpreted since its inception reveals that while trade and commerce are indeed its principle focus, the organization has extended its purview to encompass additional areas beyond what could justifiably be described as within its mandate. This paper focuses on one of these additional areas, i.e. public health concerns, and demonstrates how the WTO practice has evolved in recent years to allow more room for public health. Following Webers arguments concerning the formalization of substantive issues, it argues that whether one substantive issue will be formalized and hence incorporated into the WTOs legal structure depends on three factors: the particular nature of the substantive issue in question, the structure of the WTO and the effectiveness of the coalition of interests involved, such as the developing countries, NGOs or other international organizations such as the UN or World Health Organization. Yet, next steps of the WTO towards becoming an institution which pays more attention to the needs of the developing countries in general, and to social issues in particular, remain to be seen.
1	"The impact of Hurricane Katrina was especially dramatic in New Orleans, where catastrophic flooding threatened the lives of thousands of residents who did not or could not evacuate before the storm. To explain the large number of residents who did not evacuate in time, some commentators blame a lack of government aid and assistance for the poor while others fault an excessive dependence of the poor on government. Welfare dependency theorists, in particular, contend that a dependency-induced ""mentality of helplessness"" was prevalent among New Orleans' poor and helps to account for the incomplete evacuation. To gauge the plausibility of this argument, I use data from a unique survey to examine the characteristics of New Orleanians who were trapped in the flooded city. The findings indicate that, contrary to the expectations of welfare dependency theorists, more than half of the New Orleanians in question were employed full time before the storm and most displayed initiative after the disaster. Furthermore, in multivariate analyses, characteristics highlighted by dependency theorists did not predict the odds of pre-storm evacuation. Other explanations for the incomplete evacuation are explored."
1	This paper draws upon structural social psychological theories of small group dynamics to add predictive power to economic theories of discrimination. We first combine economic models of taste-based discrimination with social identity theory and hypothesize that discrimination is driven mainly by preferences or affinities that follow in-group/out-group boundaries. We also bring together status characteristics theory with economic views on information-based discrimination to alternatively hypothesize that discrimination is primarily driven by expectations of competency that are culturally linked to status characteristics. Predictions from both arguments are tested using data from the reality television show Survivor, a quasi-experimental setting that has compelling advantages for the study of discrimination. Specifically, we model the number of votes for elimination a contestant receives using sex, race, age, education, and group membership as explanatory variables. The results overwhelmingly support our integration of status characteristics theory and information-based models of discrimination. In the early episodes, when strategic considerations should lead contestants to value competency, low status individuals (women, minorities, and older contestants), receive more votes for elimination than high status contestants. However, as predicted from our refinement of information-based discrimination, this pattern is reversed in the later episodes. Here, when strategic considerations disfavor competency, it is high status contestants who are targeted more frequently. In contradiction to taste-based theories, discrimination tied to status characteristics is much more evident than voting according to in-group/out-group membership. We conclude by discussing the implications of our research for contemporary theories of discrimination. 
0	The purpose of this paper is to determine how the collective memories of a baseball player’s contributions to his sport change posthumously.  That is, we seek to examine if levels of veneration accorded to an athlete depends on whether he is alive or deceased, the timing of his death, and type of death he experienced. Building upon theories of cultural valorization, we propose that our collective efforts to remember retired athletes are greater if those athletes have passed on; that is, collective memory augments lifetime achievement in the consecration of individuals.  Specifically, we analyze the history of voting conducted by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) on players eligible for induction to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.  The results suggest that a variety of variables such as performance and recognition measures affect the amount of votes a player receives. However, dying exerts a powerful influence on votes received toward entry into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by hitters but not pitchers, offering partial support for our propositions.
0	In the United States, The power to go to war was not left to solitary action by a single executive, but to collective decision making through parliamentary deliberations. (Fisher 4)  While presidents may not have the ability to single-handedly declare war, they have sought other measures of gaining war powers. Hence, as George Edwards notes: Both politics and policy revolve around presidents attempts to garner public support, both for themselves and for their policies. (P. 4)  In other words, presidents often engage in permanent campaigns when pursuing support for given policies. This paper seeks to show that, prior to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration undertook a permanent campaign to persuade the American public that war with Iraq was necessary for the security of the American people. Analysis of the speeches given by members of the Bush administration prior to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and the available poll data reveals that the White House not only engaged in a permanent campaign style of informing the public, but was also successful to some degree in moving public opinion. If one accepts as a goal of democracy the limiting of domination of those less powerful, then the idea that the White House has the power to dominate the discourse regarding whether or not this nation should go to war, perhaps the most important decision facing any nation, should be unsettling to every American.
0	Although the Impoverishment Risk and Reconstruction Model (IRR) has been widely used to study policy maker’s risk evaluation and mitigation efforts in developmental project-induced population relocation process, less effort has been made to understand the effects of risk perception of the relocatees on their relocation outcomes. This study was devoted to the understanding of the role of relocatees’ risk perception in their mental health experiences. Using data collected per-and post- relocation on a sample of Chinese who were relocated to make way for the Three Gorges Dam Project, this study confirmed the hypothesis that risk perception is beneficial to individual relocatees. The lack of risk perception is associated with higher levels of relocation-related depression while risk perception reduces depression by enabling relocatees to mobilize more protective resources and coping mechanisms. Our study indicates that risk evaluation and mitigation by government alone could not guarantee successful relocation. Engaging individual relocatees in the risk evaluation and mitigation process is of great importance to improve relocation outcomes.
1	Despite longstanding interest in the effects of immigration on American society, there are few studies that examine the relationship between immigration and crime. Drawing from social disorganization theory and community resource/social capital perspectives, this study examines the effects of Latino immigration on Latino violence. Data on violence (i.e., homicide, robbery, and Violent Index) and the structural conditions of Latino populations are drawn from the California Arrest Data 
0	Whether or not a student achieves in school can be influenced by many different factors.  Some factors include the students health, the degree of family involvement in school, the school environment itself, as well as the expectations that teachers have of each individual student.  Most research considers the effects that teacher expectancies have on student achievement overall, but other research includes a focus on the effects of students gender and ethnicity as well as teachers race, gender and ethnicity.  Overall it appears that the majority of research supports the notion that teacher expectancies, whether they are high or low, have a significant impact on overall student achievement.  But like many topics there is also some research that refutes the idea and instead suggests that it is not one factor, in this case teacher expectations, but rather a myriad of factors that work together to predict overall student achievement.
1	We use the National Violence against Women (and Men) Survey to examine the effects of region and race on the tendency to carry weapons for protection. We find that Southern and Western whites are much more likely than Northern whites to carry guns for self-protection, controlling for their risk of victimization. The difference between Southern and Northern whites is particularly strong for women. We do not find much evidence for regional/race differences in carrying knives or mace. These findings provide support for the idea that regional differences in weapon carrying reflect a gun culture rather than an honor culture. We see more evidence of an honor culture among blacks: they are more likely than whites to carry knives as well as guns, controlling for their risk of victimization.
0	Women have been very active in all dominant forms of the current collective action that has seized Argentina since late December 2001.  Using data from field observations of womens activism at meetings, conferences, protest events, and other activities collected in Buenos Aires throughout 2002. I employ an analysis of the collective action frames being to show that two types of framing are prevalent: frame extension that connect womens activism to motherhood, and frame amplification that argues for a wider view of the crisis to include issues that have long been of concern to feminists.  The goals and strategies implied by groups which use these two types of frame applications are congruent to the framing choices being made by activists, both leaders and non-leaders.
1	This paper investigates the double standard in attitudes toward courtship and family formation behaviors of sons and daughters. We argue there are strong theoretical reasons to expect that the magnitude of this double standard varies across substantive domains, as well as among parents and non-parents. We also argue key methodological limitations of previous studies likely produce an under-estimate of the gender double standard. We provide empirical estimates of the gender double standard that overcome these limitations, including a random-assignment experiment explicitly designed to control the effects of social desirability. These estimates demonstrate variability in the double standard across domains and reveal key factors contributing to the magnitude of the double standards in parenting attitudes held by individuals. 
1	Using data from Add Health, this Study investigates the role of neighborhood violence in mediating the effects of neighborhood disadvantage on high school graduation and teenage pregnancy. Results show that neighborhood violence is a strong predictor of both outcomes, net of individual, family, community and school controls. Neighborhood violence accounts for almost half the conditional association between neighborhood disadvantage and high school graduation among males and almost all of the association among females. Violence also accounts for about a fifth of the conditional association between disadvantage and teenage pregnancy among adolescents of both genders. Violence is a critical social characteristic of disadvantaged neighborhoods, one that explains a sizable portion of the effects of growing LIP in such neighborhoods.
1	Suicides by young females in rural China contribute substantially to the high rate of suicide and the total number of suicides in China Given the traditional familial structure that remains largely intact in rural China, this research focuses on whether being married is a risk or protective factor for suicide by young women I examined 168 rural female suicides ages 15 to 35 in comparison with 211 rural female controls in the same age range It was found that being married is not a protective factor for suicide in rural China Fertility events are not related to suicide risk for rural young women Social support is stronger for unmarried women than for married women, and risk factors tend to be family-related issues I interpret the findings in light of Durkheim's notion of fatalistic suicide and add the Strain Theory of Suicide to account for the rural young women's suicide in Chinese culture contexts
0	In the past 30 years income generation programs have been established in Nepal to benefit poor women. Their underlying philosophy is that access to credit and its investment in entrepreneurial activities will help strengthen women's position in the family and society. The purpose of this research is to explore participants' perceptions of these programs and how they influence their lives. The study was performed in Ilam district, in far east Nepal, with two women's savings and credit cooperative groups. Using in-depth interviewing and participant observation, data was collected among 20 female participants and 14 family members. Participants appreciated the programs as sources of money to pay for daily expenses; as forums to develop social networks with other village women; and for the exposure they provide to wider society. However, no women  or men related that the programs led to changes in gender relations, while some said access to the groups was constrained by factors related to gender and class structure. The programs' outcomes can be considered small positive achievements that can contribute to the process of empowerment, but to expect income generation programs to penetrate established social structures and enable radical changes in male-female relationships, at least in the short term, is to overestimate their capabilities.
1	Policy reforms and rising income inequality transformed educational and economic opportunities for Americans approaching midlife in the 1990s. Rising income inequality may have reduced mobility, as income gaps increased between rich and poor children. Against the effects of rising inequality, Civil Rights reforms may have increased mobility, as opportunities expanded across cohorts of black students and workers. We compare educational and income mobility for two cohorts of black and white men, the older born in the late 1940s and the younger born in the early 1960s. We find that educational mobility increased for black men, but income mobility declined for both races. Economic mobility declined despite unchanged or improved educational mobility because of increased returns to schooling and increased intergenerational income correlations, independent of schooling.
0	Polygyny has declined throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, while the cultural belief that men desire sex with more than one woman has persisted.  These developments have occurred alongside an emphasis on romance and companionate marriage.  The existence of these concurrent convictions has implications for the formation and context of unions in post-polygynous societies.  We use mixed methods to explore the prevalence, characteristics, and meanings of mens multiple partnerships in urban Kenya, focusing on the widespread formation of Luo mens partnerships with jadiya, or lovers.  Instead of finding a transformation of traditional marital unions to incorporate love and romance, we find the formation of parallel unions for married men.  Men continue to take a wife because of traditional benefits and obligations, while many initiate and sustain jadiya relationships for love.  The prevalence and emotional significance of these relationships suggest that they have become an important social institution in contemporary Kenya.
1	This study shows that the organization of work, particularly the structure of jobs, can sustain or erode gender and racial disadvantage. Restructuring work around team work and weaker job boundaries can improve women's and minorities' visibility and reduce stereotyping and thus should reduce their career disadvantage. Proponents of bureaucratic formalization argue, in contrast, that relaxing formal job definitions and emphasizing social relations at work will deepen ascriptive disadvantage. The reorganization of work in corporate America over the last two decades provides a test case. Using unique data on the life histories of more than 800 organizations, the author examines whether alleviating job segregation leads to better career outcomes for women and minorities. This study finds that when employers adopt popular team and training programs that increase cross-functional collaboration, ascriptive inequality declines. Similar programs that do not transcend job boundaries do not lead to such increases. The results point to different effects at the intersection of gender and race.

1	"Despite their longstanding interest in race, American sociologists have conducted little empirical research on sociodemographic patterns or longitudinal trends in ""racial conceptualization""-that is, notions of what race is, how races differ, and the origins of race. This article outlines key empirical, methodological and theoretical considerations for a research agenda on racial conceptualization. Drawing on in-depth interviews with more than 50 college students, I describe the variety of race concepts among respondents, illustrate the importance of using multiple measures of conceptualization, and demonstrate the malleability of conceptualization, linking it to demographic context and thereby raising the question of its future evolution in the changing United States of the 21(st) century."
0	The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has become an essential feature of daily activity, but these innovations are not evenly accessible for men and women across social groups in Taiwan. Moreover, many studies predict the next generation of workers will need ICT skills to participate in the job market. Since lower education and ICT skills of women in general prevent them from participating and benefiting in the new information society, it is interesting to evaluate the extent of gender gap in ICT use and skills after experiencing a significant increase in education attainment among Taiwanese women. Using 2007 and 2010 Surveys of Digital Divide in Taiwan, we seek to investigate if differences exist between women and men. The results show that gender is associated with the likelihood of access to the Internet but not computer use. Access differences can also be accounted for by sociodemographic characteristics. Although Taiwanese women have caught up with men in ICT use gradually, there is a significant difference in applying specific ICT skills in fulfilling the job tasks in the labor market.
1	Although anti-immigrant attitudes represent a widespread social problem in many European societies, research has only partially understood the role the demographic size of the immigrant population plays for the prevalence of such attitudes. In this study, we use group threat- and intergroup contact theory to derive competing hypotheses on the role the size of the immigrant population plays for explaining the anti-immigrant attitudes of Dutch citizens. To this end, we used structural equation modeling with robust standard errors on nationally representative individual-level survey data enriched with official municipality-level statistics. We found empirical evidence for both group threat- and intergroup contact theory. Objective measurements of immigrant group size corresponded with subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size. Conversely, subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size were associated with perceptions of threatened group interests, which in turn related to anti-immigrant attitudes. On the other hand, however, larger immigrant group size facilitates intergroup contact, which was negatively associated with perceived threat and subsequent anti-immigrant attitudes. 
0	Recent studies suggest that children reinforce dominant racial ideology in their interactions with peers. Our research examines how today's children talk about race, and how that differs by gender and class. Drawing on interviews with 44 middle school children, we find that while some use colorblind rhetoric, most children in our study know that race matters, but offer alternative accounts of why and how. Some explain race as a kind of social inequality, while others offer cultural accounts of racial differences. Our data suggest that for white children, gender matters in the way they talk about race, with girls far more likely to see inequality. For non-white children, class seems to be the key, with middle-class children far more likely to give cultural explanations for race, including negative evaluations of others in their own racial group. We use an intersectionality framework as a theoretical tool to understand race-talk among today’s children.
0	This paper examines the commemoration surrounding the poaching of Samson, a large bulk elk who lived near Estes Park, Colorado.  One of the most infamous cases of poaching in the state's history, the incident galvanized the community and provoked a deeply-felt sense of loss and outrage across the town, state, and nation. In classic Durkheimian fashion, the offense attracted and concentrated people's attention, intensified collective life, elicited expression of affectively-charged sentiments, and prompted calls to memorialize the fallen elk and severely punish the offender. These gestures can be understood as forms of boundary work and collective self-definition.  The memorialization of Samson affirmed a positive boundary between the human community, on the one hand, and wildlife and the natural environment, on the other. Denunciations of the shooter drew a sharp negative boundary between poaching and hunting. But though both forms of boundary work helped clarify and reinforce the community's unique cultural identity, more significant threats to the town's relationship to the natural environment were neglected.
1	It is often assumed that the religious culture of a state can shape policies within the state, particularly concerning morality issues such as abortion or homosexuality. However, the precise manner in which religion shapes these policies has not been clearly specified. Drawing from social movements and policy literature, we argue that the influence of a state's level of evangelical adherence is mediated through mechanisms such as interest groups, issue salience, popular opinion and the political composition of the state government. We assess this theoretical model using data on states' laws regarding sexual orientation. The analysis shows that, as expected, a state's level of evangelical adherence does not have a direct effect on its policies concerning sexual orientation. However, evangelical adherence does have an indirect influence on those policies through mediating mechanisms.
1	In their widely cited study, Shavit and Blossfeld report stability of socioeconomic inequalities in educational attainment over much of the 20th century in 11 out of 13 countries. This article outlines reasons why one might expect to find declining class inequalities in educational attainment, and, using a large data set, the authors analyze educational inequality among cohorts born in the first two-thirds of the 20th century in eight European countries. They find, as expected, a widespread decline in educational inequality between students coming from different social origins. Their results are robust to other possible choices of method and variables, and the authors offer some explanations of why their findings contradict Shavit and Blossfeld's conclusions.
0	The popularity of ballroom dance has ebbed and flowed over the years.  In this paper we argue that the attitude that Americans have toward ballroom dance tends to reflect societys acceptance and rejection of different expressions of femininity and masculinity.  We were curious to know why Ballroom dance, which is predicated upon very rigid gender roles, has become so popular in the past few years.  Is it an indication that the ideals of feminism have diminished in American society? We used in-depth interviews and participant observation to explore how modern ballroom dancers construct gender identities.  The first author interviewed 62 ballroom social and competitive ballroom dancers in the California Bay Area.  There were 32 women and 30 men in our sample.  We found that men and women construct complex gender identities that are both traditional and progressive simultaneously.  Men and women today are creating gender identities according to their own terms, and they are choosing to incorporate both traditional and non traditional traits into their gender identity.  The ballroom dancers we met reinforced this gender complexity and reminded us that neither men nor women are bound to follow one standard of masculinity or femininity.  Rather, each person is free to choreograph their own gender identity.
0	This paper examines how mothers constitute childhood in and through their talk about mundane child-rearing practices.  It relates to a growing body of scholarship, from social historians, psychologists and sociologists, which is concerned with the social construction and historical variability of childhood.  Although there have been some attempts to identify the images of childhood that underpin contemporary social and public policy, there is relatively little empirical work examining how parents constitute the children they rear or the ways in which such images of childhood inform the mundane daily practices that make up contemporary child-care. This paper addresses that gap using data from a longitudinal qualitative interview study of mothers practices around feeding their young children.  A sample of 36 women, stratified by age and occupational class, was followed from late in their first pregnancies until two years after their babies were born.  Their talk about feeding their babies was embedded in broader discussion about the nature of childhood and the implications of this for child-rearing practices.   The analysis presented here focuses upon the images of children and childhood which underpin mothers talk about children in general and their own children in particular.  It examines the links between such images of childhood and the actuality of the womens child-rearing practices.  The extent to which the images employed by individual mothers are consistent or ambivalent and contradictory, and change over time, as their children grow older, is also considered.
1	This analysis combines results and models from prior analyses of ecological effects on educational outcomes to specify a comprehensive path model estimated separately for male and female respondents to the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen. We find that males are exposed to higher levels of violence and disorder than females, and that the gender gap in such exposure grows as the ecological concentration of minority group members increases. At the same time, however, ecological effects on academic performance appear to be stronger for females than males. In the rare cases where females are exposed to high levels of disorder and violence, the effects on college grades are quite large. Nonetheless, relatively few females experience high exposure to violence and social disorder, and, as a result, male grades are more influenced by the ecological disadvantage. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1	"International research shows that both work-family conflict and time pressure are increasing in Western societies. With these increased pressures, precisely those people who are combining work and family obligations may be missing from survey estimates. This study investigates whether the measurement of work-family conflict (WFC) and time pressure is influenced by nonresponse bias. Using the Flemish ""Work, Family and Time use in Flanders""-survey and the Basic Question survey for nonrespondents of this survey, we investigate whether nonrespondents score higher on subjective and objective indicators of WFC and time pressure than respondents. Results show that nonrespondents are indeed those sample units who experience significantly more WFC and time pressure, demonstrating that WFC and time pressure related nonresponse biases exist. Implications and suggestions to reduce bias in data collections are discussed. "
1	"Identity politics arises out of conditions of systematic stigmatization and structural disadvantage, but sharing a social structural position does not guarantee that people will define themselves and their collectivity in the same way. In fact, because identity politics occupies two major points of tension, it gives rise to several alternative ways of conceptualizing the ""we,"" the collective self. Using ethnographic material gathered on American Jews' understandings of anti-Semitism and its relationship to contemporary politics, this article inductively discerns four alternative models of collective selfhood (embattled, relating, political, and redeemed) that correspond to four alternative narratives of identity politics (reified identity, humanistic dialogue, critical solidarity, and evangelism). These narratives help explain the deep emotions sparked by challenges to people's self-definitions. A comparison to studies of LGBT movements further reveals the utility of this conceptualization and elaborates a model not apparent in the first case."
0	Studies have shown religious organizations to be among the most trusted institutions of civil society in Europe.  Similarly, research has shown that, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, church organizations boast far higher levels of trust than government organizations or non-religious civil society institutions.  In this study, the link between religion and trust in democratic institutions among individuals is explored in relation to the size of the largest religious group in twenty-one European countries.  Based on the European Social Survey (Round II, 2004) and using Multi-Level Modeling it is concluded that the larger the size of the largest religious group, the lower the level of trust in democratic institutions among religious minorities.  This finding supports hypothesis that the larger the size of the largest religious group, the more likely the minorities are to fear that the government is dominated by the largest religious group and their interests are not represented.
0	Public discourse often fails to acknowledge that racism is a collective phenomenon and that race itself is a social position in a hierarchy.  In other words, Americans often reduce “racism” to its individual manifestations of prejudice and discrimination and essentialize race.  Despite this narrowed public conception, public discourse on racism often explains not only the actions and attitudes of individuals but group phenomena, like the dimensions of racial inequality.  This paper explores how Americans simultaneously individualize racism and embrace group identity and explanations for group-based phenomenon like racial inequality.  I argue that racial controversies demonstrate this phenomenon.  I define a racial controversy as media coverage where racism becomes the dominant focus at the expense of the specific characteristics of the initial incident that sparked media coverage.  In these cases, public discourse moves beyond blaming individuals for racism or racial problems but instead ultimately blames racial groups.  To illustrate this phenomenon, this paper examines. one of these “racial events” – the Don Imus scandal in 2007 – to demonstrate how an individual incident, one that would be most suited for only individualistic analysis becomes, like most public controversies, a public forum for claims making.  I analyze print media during the two weeks the Imus controversy was in the news.  I find that while media reports cast some individuals as blameworthy, the controversy centers not on the blameworthy racist but on a search for the blameworthy racial group.
0	Relatively little attention has been paid to lower courts capacity to bring about social change, despite the fact that the vast majority of citizens who come into contact with the judicial system will have their case considered (and most likely only considered) by these courts.  Often these citizens experience a range of personal and psychological problems that are social in origin, including precarious employment, welfare dependence, financial hardship and various health problems, including mental health and drug-dependency.  In this context, we suggest a dialectical view of law and social change.  Magistrates courts must respond to social change and its human fallout and, in so doing, can contribute to progressive social change in a local, personal and incremental way.
0	This paper examines the logic of colonialism/neocolonialism in the context of neoliberal globalization and its impact of Filipino women and its implications for the long process of decolonization.  Such examination illuminates how colonial development and its continuing, nuanced manifestations in the context of neoliberal globalization are gendered in ways that configure the intersections of gender, race, and class.  The Philippines with a long history of colonization under Spain and United States, and today continues to be an American neocolony provides a good case in point in which we see how gendered colonial legacies are buttressed by the politics of neoliberal globalization.  Yet, they are contested as the process of decolonization are partly shaped by women.
1	Academic careers have traditionally been conceptualized as pipelines, through which young scholars move seamlessly from graduate school to tenure-track positions. This model often fails to capture the experiences of female Ph.D. recipients, who become tenure-track assistant professors at lower rates than do their male counterparts. What do these women do instead? We use panel data from the 1983-1995 Surveys of Doctorate Recipients to explore the early careers of Ph.D. recipients. Our results show that female doctorate recipients are disproportionately likely to be employed as adjunct faculty or exit the paid labor force, especially if they have young children. Contrary to conventional wisdom, adjunct professorships provide a better opportunity forgetting a tenure-track job down the road than do non-teaching positions inside or outside of academia. Collectively these findings show that the academic life course is both complex and permeable.
0	Gender domination contains elements of a dominance and privilege of gender normativity and a subordination of gender non-normativity. This subordination manifests in subjugations specific to trans and gender variant people, and takes place when gender variation becomes visible or perceptible, or when gender becomes questionable, illegible, indiscernible, non-categorizable. As the practice of gender attribution and conceptions of binary gender categories play an important role in shaping everyday social interactions, people who depart from normative gender identity and/or expression have unique experiences in the process of “doing gender.” Combining observations of and interviews with transgender and gender variant people, I analyze how people who perceive them respond to their gendered appearances, and how my participants feel in response. I find that trans and gender variant people perform emotional labor when they are “othered”: when they encounter blatant hostility, misinterpretations, confusion or discomfort, and microaggressions. Participants experience transgender-specific minority stress in feelings of fear, anxiety, hurt, indignity, exhaustion, frustration, and the feeling of not being seen. Key to this stress is the repetitive and cumulative nature of these various othering interactive responses. In particular, when the interactive process of “doing gender” halts because a gender is non-categorizable, trans people and the people perceiving them experience a feeling of “gender anomie.” I combine methods of grounded theory and narrative analysis to describe the process of microaggressive interaction and emotional labor that my participants face. I find that normative practices of gender attribution and dominant gender optics play an integral role in transgender oppression.
0	Late twentieth century censuses have been interpreted alternatively as impositions of state authority or outcomes of historically new social influences in the form of social movements. We do not deny state or social influence on censuses, but we show that these two particular views of state and social influence are too narrow. States were quite limited in their ability to impose censuses on their populations. Social movements were undoubtedly important, but their appearance was historically contingent. We showed this here is three ways by comparing contemporary censuses in the US, Britain, and Italy. First, the historical pattern of information gathering, not solely states’ demands, were important. Second, highly instrumental censuses that provided usable data to the government, social groups, businesses, and academics developed where there was intense interaction between social groups and different pieces of the state, such as the legislature, local government groups, and the census agencies. Third, the rise of social movements depended on these first two patterns; namely that the census had been historically institutionalized in such a way to involve many parties over a long period of time. Thus, censuses in the US tended to be highly controversial and subject to lobbying by many parties, while censuses in Italy generally provoked little controversy. Britain formed an intermediate case.
0	One striking outcome of the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment was mental health improvements for adults who received housing vouchers to move out of public housing. This finding raises an important question for understanding how neighborhood contexts influence mental health and for understanding the efficacy of mobility policies: Is the MTO finding a neighborhood effect—neighborhood contexts affect mental health? Or a program effect—“winning” a lottery improves one’s mental well-being? Using longitudinal survey data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, this paper explores potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between neighborhoods and mental health—that the act of moving influences one’s mental health; and that neighborhood demographic and social process contexts matter for mental health. Results suggest that neighborhood mobility predicts mental health, but in the opposite direction of MTO findings—moving to a new Census tract increases the likelihood of depression. With regard to neighborhood context, for blacks, moving into a neighborhood with more white residents increases the risk of depression, and for whites, moving into a neighborhood with more foreign-born residents decreases the risk of depression. Changes in poverty rate, even extreme changes like those in MTO, did not affect depression. Changes in social process variables such as perceptions of disorder, crime victimization, and perceptions of violence did not significantly predict depression for those who moved into a new Census tract. My analyses demonstrate the importance of investigating the mechanisms underpinning experimental findings before extrapolating results to assumptions about social life or about policy efficacy.
0	This paper elaborates social closure mechanisms that restrict access to remunerative occupations and investigates how gender inequality in rewards is conditioned by those closure devices using census 2000 data and other secondary sources. Hypotheses are tested to see whether social closure devices, based on group membership and on opportunities for occupation specific skills trainings, work in a gender specific manner or not. Hierarchical linear models regressing gender gaps in earnings on social closure variables are estimated with controls for an array of occupational characteristics and individual-level human capital. Findings suggest that, contrary to the hypotheses, educational credentialing and unionization work to the advantage of female employees while skills training dimension of social closure has no significant effects. However caution is advised as there is no data that allow for separating the rent generating effects of closure devices from the gatekeeping effects for the subordinate groups. Further research is recommended to explore relevant data and develop models to address these sophisticated questions.
0	This study examines the role of the colonial state and the reactions of each social class through the IA project in Early Colonial Korea. The colonial state tried to achieve the economic and political purpose of constructing efficiently dominated structure through the IA project. These efforts were propelled by strong state capacity and the colonial state attempted to attain state capacity by producing a framework for institutionalized interaction with the society that required embeddedness. The landlord class positively responded to such incentive structure in order to maximize their economic interest through the IA project. However, peasants or tenants class, who were structurally excluded from such institutional framework, were opposed to this incentive structure. As the contrived outcome of IA project, the class structure became deeply polarized into landlords and tenants, and this was one of the gravest dimensions of structural distortion that the colonial states colonial policy brought to early colonial Korea. Through this process, we can clearly comprehend the characteristics of colonial modernity in colonial Korea. There is more probability that this structure can bring an overall structural distortion to society, since that colonial modernity is not formed through continual interaction between the state and society, but externally transplanted.
0	U.S. immigration policy has been subject to two contradictory trends: (1) gender equality in eligibility to legally immigrate as permanent residents; and (2) gender inequality in the original 1986 amnesty program and legal labor recruitment or impact of proposed guest worker programs. The key results are the equalization of male and female immigrants sex ratios as a whole and the imbalance of sex ratios in traditional male sojourner immigrant streams and new woman initiated sex ratio imbalanced streams. Increasingly, the labor market is both heterogenized and divided by degree of rights based on citizenship, permanent alien, H2-4 or undocumented status. Academicians need to reach an understanding of the feminization of migration and the impact of heterogenization of the international labor force and virtual migration. Immigration policies proposed in 2006 are based on old thinking which respond to citizen sense of threat but do not recognize global realities or pay sufficient attention to human rights. This paper concludes by suggesting rethinking immigration policy in terms of the new gendering of immigration and global social change.
1	This research addresses the complexity of embedded inter-firm ties. Based on both qualitative and quantitative data from field research in the computer motherboard manufacturing industry, this paper investigates the origins of close ties and committed relationships, and explores the relationships between these two dimensions of embedded inter-firm relationships. The results show that companies establish close relationships with their partners to resolve coordination uncertainty due to a high level of task interdependence in their exchanges, and that firms become more collaboratively committed when they seek to alter a disadvantaged power asymmetry. At the same time, the fieldwork found an underlying conflict between the embeddedness dimensions of closeness and commitment: too much closeness reduces a partner's commitment. These findings have significant implications for the formation of embedded corporate ties as well as the effects of embeddedness on organizations. 
1	Recent studies studies that gender may be less influential on the experience of emotion than originally believed. Most of these studies, however, have focused almost exclusively on gender differences in discrete emotional experiences, paying less attention to the ways in which emotions may co-occur within a relatively short period. Using the General Survey's 1996 emotions module, I examine the cot-relational structure of nine latent emotion factors - tranquility, joy, hope, pride, self-reproach, anger, rage, fear and distress - by gender. Using the technique of shortest path analysis, I find women's most common emotional pathways are longer, more complex, and more likely to use more positive and less powerful emotions titan those most common to men. Implications for emotion management, both personal at id interpersonal, are discussed.
1	Young American workers typically change employers many times in the course of establishing their careers. This article examines the consequences of this mobility for wage inequalities between and among men and women. Using multilevel modeling and data from the 1979 to 2002 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), I disentangle the various ways in which mobility shapes the trajectories of wage growth. Findings caution against accepting the adequacy of prevalent economic models of mobility-models that tend to isolate individual workers' moves from broader patterns of work history and that treat mobility as a decontextualized individual choice. Although workers who frequently switch employers generally end up earning less than their more-stable counterparts, the type, timing, and relative level of changes strongly affect the ultimate wage differential. Differences in the degree,of men and women labor-force attachment and family circumstances are also influential. Workers who are less attached to the labor force benefit less from changing employers, and women who are married or have children also tend to experience less-favorable mobility-wage outcomes.
0	While all types of social contacts can provide social support, contacts who are trained experts allow access to particularly valuable resources in the form of specialized knowledge. Individuals can access experts through formal, contractual relationships, but those who have an expert within their network of close family and friends may benefit from more convenient and lower-cost access to expert knowledge. In this paper, we explore the prevalence and nature of expert contacts within individuals social networks using nationally representative data from the 1985 and 2004 General Social Surveys. About a quarter of Americans count an expert among their network contacts. However, such contacts are unequally distributed across sociodemographic groups. Racial minorities and members of the lower and working classes are less likely to report having ties to experts, and their relationships with experts are weaker than those of whites and members of the upper class. Furthermore, the racial gap in network-based access to expertise appears to have widened over the past twenty years. We urge further research to examine the explanations for and consequences of disparities in access to expertise through social networks.
1	A number of studies have shown that, as a result of the ambiguity of US legal mandates, organizations have considerable latitude in how they comply with regulations. In this paper, we address how the different agendas of the federal and state governments increase ambiguities in state-firm relations and how states are interested actors in creating opportunities for firms to navigate the federal legislation. We analyze the institutional forces behind bank acquisitions within and across state lines in order to illuminate the ways that US states take advantage of federal ambiguity and are able to shape corporate practices to their benefit. We specifically examine how patterns of bank acquisitions are shaped by the crucial relationship between the federal Community Reinvestment Act 
0	Using CPS data from 1976 to 2009 we compare stay-at-home father households with stay-at-home mother and dual-earners households. We examine the differences in the characteristics of stay-at-home father households. We find that stay-at-home father households have older children, and fewer children under age 5 than stay-at-home mother and dual-earners households and older children than stay-at-home mother households. We also find that mothers in stay-at-home father households are much more educated than their husbands and experience the sharpest increase in education over time compared to all spouses in other types of households. Both spouses in stay-at-home father households are older than spouses in stay-at-home mother and dual-earner households. We interpret the results as evidence of greater choice among families to live in a stay-at-home father household arrangement.
0	Capable and accountable public authority has proven elusive throughout the developing world, but not entirely unattainable. Southeast Asia exhibits as much if not more cross-case variation than any other region in terms of both state capacity and levels of democratic accountability. Why have some of this regions states proven so much more capable, particularly at mobilizing tax revenue, than others? And why have some of Southeast Asias authoritarian regimes proven so much more durable than others? This comparative-historical analysis of seven countries locates the answer to both puzzles in the patterns of contentious politics (i.e. labor strikes, ethnic riots, and rural rebellions) that emerged between the end of Japans occupation of Southeast Asia in 1945, and the inauguration of bureaucratic-authoritarian regimes throughout the region between the mid-1950s and the early 1970s. Subtly divergent patterns of contentious politics produced striking divergence in contemporary political institutions. In short, contemporary political institutions (parties, states, and regimes) have all been shaped by patterns of elite collective action, which arose in response to specific types of threats from below.
1	"This paper will address the question of Islamic fatalism. Survey data will be used to assess Samuel R Huntington controversial ""Clash of Civilizations"" thesis and its emphasis on fatalism as an inherent characteristic of Islamic religion. The concept of fatalism is expanded and theorized as a function of both structural and theological dimensions. Findings here suggest that fatalism in the Islamic world remains a largely misunderstood phenomenon. Christians living in predominantly Muslim countries are no more fatalistic than their Muslim neighbors, and in Indonesia, Christians report higher levels of fatalism than Indonesian Muslims. However, Muslims do indicate a higher level of belief that cosmological forces control lifer outcomes than do Christians living in those same Islamic societies. Findings also suggest that the effect of Western influence on fatalism is not as straightforward as that predicted by Huntington theory. Fatalism in the Muslim world is best understood in light of complex historical, cultural, economic and socio-political processes and not as a direct outcome of Western influence and/or religious denomination alone."
0	The 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce was used to investigate the effects of work type on womens lives.  Specifically, it was hypothesized that self-employed women have better work-family fit than organizationally employed women.  It was also hypothesized that as a result of better work-family fit, self-employed women would report better mental health than organizationally employed women.  The analysis shows only limited support for the hypotheses. Of the different dimensions of work-family fit, self-employment directly influenced only positive spillover from job to home.  Work type had no direct influence on mental health.  It appears that work type may indirectly influence work-family fit and mental health through higher job satisfaction and increased autonomy. Implications of the findings are discussed.
1	Standardized coefficients in logistic regression analysis have the same utility as standardized coefficients in linear regression analysis. Although there has been no consensus on the best way to construct standardized logistic regression coefficients, there is now sufficient evidence to suggest a single best approach to the construction of a standardized logistic regression coefficient(1) that can be used in the same way across a broad range of problems as the standardized linear regression coefficient and also to suggest the adequacy of other approaches for limited purposes. This article reviews the state of knowledge regarding the use of standardized coefficients in general and standardized logistic regression coefficients in particular, and makes specific recommendations on how to hest use (and avoid abusing) standardized logistic regression coefficients.
1	Drawing on institutionalist theory, we conceptualize the racial composition of the boards of directors of large American companies as shaped in response to social and political norms. We use new longitudinal and cross-sectional data to test hypotheses about factors that shape the degree of racial inclusion on boards of directors among large public corporations, and we draw upon in-depth interviews with key participants to gain insights into the mechanisms that are likely to have generated the patterns we detect in our statistical models. We find evidence suggesting that large American corporations manage the racial composition of their elite leadership groups in response to these norms. 
1	In this study we focus on the relationship between ethnic diversity and informal social capital. As this refers to rather strong social ties in the intimate domain, it is a strict test of Putnam's claim that ethnic diversity would decrease social capital. In order to explain these relationships, we derived mediating mechanisms from conflict and contact theory. Using data from the European Social Survey (2002/2003), we applied multilevel analyses considering three levels: individuals, regions and countries. Our results revealed a direct positive effect of ethnic diversity at the country level on informal helping, yet no indirect effect via the mediating variables. At the regional level, we only found an indirect effect of ethnic diversity. Here, ethnic diversity increases the likelihood of intergroup contact that in turn is positively related to both informal social meeting and helping. Perceived ethnic threat turned out to have a negative effect on informal social meeting. 
0	In many economically advanced societies, higher education is beeing transformed from elite to a mass system. Massification has been accompanied by institutional differentiation. Systems, which had consisted almost exclusively of research universities have added a second-tier of less selective colleges. These second tier institutions have absorbed most of the growth in enrollments.  At one and the same time, higher education is opening up to the working classes, and is being stratified within. This paper reports results of a 15 country comparative study of the association between the transformation of higher education on the one hand, and changes in educational stratification on the other hand. We capitalize on differences between countries in the extent of higher educational expansion and its forms of differentiation, and study how they are related to changes in the rates of attendance in the first and second tier institutions as well as class, gender and ethnic/racial inequalities therein.
0	Since the 1960s, identity politics have been the organizing force for social movement protest, mobilization, and collective action in the United States.  First, I sketch three general phases of identity politics in order to situate the case study on the emergence of the Chicano to Hispanic/Latino movement.  I conclude by reflecting on some of the conundrums that identity politics foreground in the contemporary period in general.  This paper has dual intents:  it sketches conceptual issues within identity politics broadly, discussing racial, gender and sexual minorities in its introduction and conclusion and uses the rise of Latino as a panethnic category to concretize some of the conceptual issues it raises in the process.
0	The best-known theory of choice is neo-classical economics and it places special emphasis on prices.  This paper develops an alternative, a sociological theory of choice.  This theory is grounded in core issues in sociology: the study of status and hierarchy.  Using restaurant reviews as a case study the paper shows how people use the hierarchies created by published reviews to help them make choices. The hierarchies supply audiences with information when price information is unavailable or uninformative. Price information is weakest for many cultural products and this is exactly where reviews and the sociology of choice are most important.
1	Last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) originated as a way of replacing missing measurements for use in classical repeated measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA) where complete data are required. As mathematical statisticians developed newer methods in the attempt to deal effectively with missing data, LOCF fell largely by the wayside. This paper reports use of simulation methods to evaluate validity of tests of significance for differences in mean rates of change applied to LOCF-completed data and compares results with those from alternative procedures that do not require replacement of the missing values for dropouts. Across several different data structures and dropout mechanisms, tests of significance for difference in means of slope coefficients fitted to LOCF data maintained appropriate Type 1 error protection. In no case where the Type 1 error rates of more complex generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) tests appeared appropriately conservative did the power of those tests exceed power of the simpler test on LOCF-completed data. 
0	Gentrification has been a major factor reshaping North American cities for at least four decades, as well as a vital concern of sociological research. In recent years, there appears to be an increasing awareness of the process among contemporary gentrifiers themselves. This self-conscoiusness is significant on two levels: (1) it is unanticipated by or at least unaccounted for in much of the canonical literature on gentrification, having only recently gained acknowledgement (most notably work by Brown-Saracino that explores aspects of a particular type of self-aware gentrifiier); (2) it is complicating the way many gentrifiers or would-be gentrifiers frame and actively work toward their ideals of neighborhood, community, and place. Responding to existing literature and recent critiques, we combine findings from our own ethnographic research on first-wave “neo-bohemians” in distinct contexts of early-stage gentrification in Chicago and Vancouver. We demonstrate the degree to which these individuals, possessing shared ideals for lifestyle and community and a romanticization of “authentic” and “edgy” urban places, exhibit a sophisticated understanding of the process and complicated attitudes towards their own responsibility for neighborhood change. By focusing on first-wave gentrifiers in rapidly changing neighborhoods - overlooked in Brown-Saracino's work and other recent studies - we address the degree to which these individuals reconcile (or do not) their self-consciousness around their own gentrifier status. Making use of our findings in the two different sites, we also demonstrate the importance of context, by arguing that this activity is shaped both by shared cultural values and specific environmental contexts.
1	To illuminate how race affects the usage of punitive tools in policy implementation settings, we analyze sanctions imposed for noncompliant client behavior under welfare reform. Drawing on a model of racial classification and policy choice, we test four hypotheses regarding client race, local context, and sanctioning. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional multilevel analyses of individual-level administrative data, we find that race plays a significant role in shaping sanction implementation. Its effects, however, are highly contingent on client characteristics, local political contexts, and the degree to which state governments devolve policy control to local officials.
1	When entrepreneurs enter structural holes in networks, they can exploit the related benefits. Evidence for these benefits has steadily accumulated. The authors ask whether those who strive for such structural advantages can maintain them if others follow their example. Burt speculates that they cannot, but a formal demonstration of this speculation is lacking. Using a game theoretic model of network formation, the authors characterize the networks that emerge when everyone strives for structural holes. They find that the predominant stable networks distribute benefits evenly, confirming that no one is able to maintain a structural advantage in the long run.
1	Organizations active in mobilizing low- and moderate-income communities make considerable efforts to combat inequalities and build voice for citizens, despite inherent challenges of obtaining resources, maintaining member interest, and retaining staff. How, then, do such groups remain viable-even thriving-organizations? Building upon research on organizational theory and social movements, we examine patterns of survival among a sample of community-based organizations 
1	The educational, occupational and income success of the racial minority immigrant offspring is very similar for many immigrant origins groups in the United States, Canada and Australia. An analysis based on merged files of Current Population Surveys for the United States for the period 1995-2007, and the 2001 Censuses of Canada and Australia, and taking account of urban areas of immigrant settlement, reveals common patterns of high achievement for the Chinese and South Asian second generation, less for other Asian origins, and still less for those of Afro-Caribbean black origins. Relatively lower entry statuses for these immigrant groups in the US are eliminated for the second generation, indicating they experience stronger upward inter-generational mobility. As well, 'segmented assimilation' suggesting downward assimilation of Afro-Caribbean immigrants into an urban underclass in the US, also receives little support. 
0	Most accounts of maquila workers in the activist and academic literatures present workers as victims. In this paper I present a more nuanced view by examining how the diversity of workers by class, social support networks, family responsibility, age, and sex influences the ability of workers to find better jobs in the maquilas and to resist against poor treatment or poor working conditions in their current jobs.  This research is based on two months of interviews in a typical rural/urban town in Northern Honduras. This region has over 200 maquilas employing over 100,000 workers and is the seventh largest exporter of apparel to the US.  This region also has a diversity of maquilas with a wide range of working conditions and pay that ranges from $25 to $80 week for sewing machine operators.  My research finds that workers with greater family wealth and stronger social support network are able to secure and keep higher paying jobs.  For these workers, maquilas can provide upward mobility through investments in building a home or to pay a smuggler for a trip to the U.S.  Such workers are also more likely to resist or leave dangerous and abusive working conditions.  In contrast, the older and poorest workers with limited social support networks and many family responsibilities are the most vulnerable to dangerous and abusive working conditions.  These workers also tend to be the least likely to resist or complain.
1	Previous research has suggested that men who were exposed to combat during wartime differed from those who were not Yet little is known about how selection into combat has changed over time This paper estimates sequential logistic models using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine the stratification of military service and combat exposure in the US during the last six decades of the 20th century It tests potentially overlapping hypotheses drawn from two competing theories class bias and dual selection It also tests a hypothesis drawn from the life course perspective that the processes by which people came to see combat have changed historically The findings show that human capital institutional screening and class bias all determined who saw combat They also show that net of historical change in the odds of service and combat the Impact of only one background characteristic race changed over time 
0	The theoretical disunity of micro- and macro-level research on consumption has turned the issue of class identity into a perennial open question. A proper test across time and types of consumption is missing. I argue that data on consumer expenditures provide the adequate measure for the test. I use sample data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey for 1960-61, 1982-84 and 2000-02. Separate linear regression models are fitted to five variables of aggregate consumption. The results indicate a moderate statistically significant class effect across time and consumption types. The strongest, slightly increasing class effects are on leisure and clothing expenditures; while the effect on consumer spending on food and transportation declines. Income, education and race also have statistically significant effects.
0	Perceived discrimination, like actual discrimination, has important consequences. For example, researchers have documented a variety of health outcomes associated with perceived discrimination, including anxiety (Kessler et al. 1999; St. Jean and Feagin 1998), psychological distress (Kessler et al. 1999; Sellers et al. 2003), and hypertension (St. Jean and Feagin 1998). A vast literature suggests that because racial minorities are likely to encounter barriers due to their position in society, they are likely to perceive personal discrimination.  Nevertheless, Wilson (1978, 1980) and others contend that Blacks relative disadvantage in contemporary American society results more from structured inequities more related to social class than to race. This study examines race and class as competing explanations for African American male’s perceptions of both lifetime and everyday racial discrimination. Using data from the African American Men Survey (AAMS) we found that when income is the SES indicator, our results, across five types of “lifetime” and “everyday” discrimination, offer little support for the declining significance of race argument (only two of five significant SES associations indicated that lower income African American males perceived greater discrimination—housing and lack of respect). In contrast, when education is the SES indicator, our results, offer no support for the declining significance of race argument (none of the six significant SES associations indicated that lower income African American male’s perceived greater discrimination). Thus, just two of eleven significant SES associations, across five types of “lifetime” and “everyday” discrimination, support the declining significance of race argument.
1	A large body of social science literature has focused on the factors that influence sentencing outcomes within the federal court system A neglected variable in this line of research is the citizenship status of the offender Using the United States Sentencing Commission s Monitoring of Federal Criminal Sentences data from 2006 the present study examines the effect of citizenship status on the likelihood of incarceration and the length of the prison sentence This study extends previous research in three ways first by examining citizenship status using post-Booker data second exploring the differences between citizens, legal aliens and illegal aliens rather than comparing all non-citizens to US citizens and third examining all offenses rather than only drug offenses Most importantly, this study partitions the data by citizenship status to determine if the effects of race/ethnicity and other variables (e g. type of offense and level of education) vary by citizenship status The results demonstrate that both legal and illegal aliens have a higher probability of incarceration than similarly-situated US citizens but that the sentences imposed on illegal aliens are shorter than those imposed on citizens However different results emerged when the data were partitioned by citizenship status Judges imposed shorter prison sentences on Latino citizens but longer prison sentences on Latino illegal aliens These results are discussed in relation to theoretical explanations and policy implications 
1	In this article, using data on traffic volume and fatal accident rates in Israel from 2001 to 2004 a period spanning much of the Second Intifada-we examine the population-level responses to endemic terror to uncover whether societies become habituated so that the response weakens Following repeated attacks or whether they become increasingly sensitized so subsequent attacks have a greater impact. Our analysis, using distributed-lag time series models, supports earlier findings while highlighting the persistence of the response to terror attacks even several years into the violence. There arc, however, signs that the reaction to terror has accelerated. This shift, which is not naturally seen as evidence for either habituation or sensitization, is suggestive of social learning of norms over time.
1	This article studies the relationship between household income and housework time across 33 countries. In most countries, low-income individuals do more housework than their high-income counterparts; the differences are even greater for women's domestic work time. The analysis shows that the difference between rich and poor women's housework time falls with economic development and rises with overall economic inequality. I use a cross-national reinterpretation of arguments from the historical time-use literature to show that this is attributable to the association between economic development and the diffusion of household technologies and to the association between economic inequality and the prevalence of service consumption among high-income households. Results for a direct measure of technology diffusion provide striking evidence for the first interpretation. The findings question the widespread notion that domestic technologies have had little or no impact on women's housework time. On a general level, I find that gender inequalities are fundamentally conditioned by economic inequalities. A full understanding of the division of housework requires social scientists to go beyond couple-level dynamics and situate households and individuals within the broader social and economic structure.
0	In the year 2003, one of the most media-intensive events in thoroughbred racing was the slaughter of Ferdinand, a Kentucky Derby winner, champion and Horse of the Year who had been sent to Japan as an older stallion. Ferdinands death raised many questions about the ethics of care for aged thoroughbreds and, in the United States, the continued slaughter of horses.This essay examines how both media and industry reaction to tragic occurrences involving equine celebrities can motivate legislators and the public to act on behalf of more highly regarded animals. In addition, it may illuminate a path towards helping less visible animals. There is a need to pass federal laws such as the Horse Slaughter Act and to extend its protection so that pet food and rendering as fertilizer are not uncovered options. The need to act will not stop there. Animals need the moral status to receive guardianship and not to be treated as property. There is a need to erode the fiction that animals are things and pursue legislation granting greater social and moral value to animals.
0	Based on the work of social psychologist Milton Rokeach (1973 and 1979:129-147, 179-191), we construct a measure of community value orientation based on the relative emphasis individuals place on two values-freedom and equality--as a guiding principle in their lives. We also understand that this particular apporach to assessing receptivity to meeting civic or community needs has an egalitarian basis. In this poster presentation, we use this two-value model to examine community value orientation and self-reported attitudes toward various issues. Respondents who appear to be high on our measure of community value orientation (i.e. they rank freedom and equality high or equality slightly higher than freedom) should also show more favorable attitudes toward supporting social programs that attempt to reduce inequality. In other words, individuals high on community value orientation will tend to assume there is a collective responsibility for rectifying problems in the larger society.
0	Resurgent interest in strain theories of protest behavior has highlighted the importance of economic threat for political mobilization. However, many of the insights of this approach are derived from case studies of specific movements, leaving open the possibility that the influence of threat is limited to certain contexts.  To remedy the absence of systematic research on economic threat, this study uses a standardized, cross-national dataset to evaluate the recent claims.  Using the unemployment rate as a measure of economic threat, the results suggest that the mobilizing effects of economic uncertainty are limited to those individuals who are most economically vulnerable—specifically, manual workers in liberal and corporatist welfare states.  The findings highlight the relevance of two sources of economic protection: occupational benefits at the individual level and welfare policies at the national level.  The implications of these findings underscore the importance of attending to the institutional environment in which economic threat emerges and suggest the benefits of a comparative, multilevel approach to the study of protest behavior.

0	This paper addresses two questions on the role of the family and social security policies in providing retirement support for the senior generation in an Asian context: (a) Does the traditional vision of the senior generation as aged and family-dependent still prevails in Asia?; and (b) What are the best predictors of family financial support for the senior generation? Two sets of data are used to explore these questions: a comparative analysis of census data and official statistics on family life in ten Asian countries and a subsample of the 1999 National Study on Families in Singapore (N = 400). Findings reveal a process of social transformation and the presence of a new and autonomous generation of seniors; and the tendency of families to provide financial support to only their less autonomous and less able senior members. The implications of these two trends are discussed.
0	? I have  begun exploring the structure and culture of scandal in what I call the no-fault society in a series of articles and  papers (Jacobs 2005, 2006).  In this roundtable presentation, I wish to start exploring its phenomenology.  In terms of practical significance, understanding the phenomenology of scandal is necessary to understand the processes of informal social control that undergird the failed processes of formal control in US corporations.  The first step in approaching this problem is to canvass competing approaches to phenomenology, surveying the alternative postulates they pose.  What is the phenomenology of compromised personal integrity, as seen through the various lenses of symbolic interactionism, psychoanalysis, existentialism, and dramaturgy?
0	Like the United States as a country, the U.S. military organization has overcome many barriers in its history: the end of segregation in the 1950s, fully integrating women in the 1980s, and the end of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy in the 2010s. The goal of this paper is to examine how accepting modern soldiers are toward these groups. Data from the Bi-Annual Survey of Students (BASS) provide insights into the perspectives of military academy and ROTC cadets as compared to civilian students. We compared their perspectives on the role of women in service, having gays openly serve, and whether the services should consider allowing immigrants to serve in the U.S. armed services. Our findings show that military affiliates are generally more conservative than their civilian peers: cadets are significantly less open to having women serve in combat roles in the military, less supportive of gays openly serving in the military,  and they are less open to having immigrants serve as a way of gaining access to American citizenship than their civilian counterparts. However, our data also portray a fairly diverse set of perspectives. That is, there are as many military affiliates who support these forms of diversity than those who do not. Thus, it appears that the incoming diversity will be met with a diverse set of beliefs about it.
1	Pooling National Health Interview Survey 1972-1996 data, this study examines whether the threshold of health is rising, such that individuals are more likely to report poor health based on weaker symptoms. The results suggest that those with some form of disability report poor health more often today than they did in the past. Yet the results also reveal a pattern more complex than a simple rising-threshold story. For one, the results suggest a non-linear trend: the conditional reporting of poor health grew steadily until 1983, as expected, but declined thereafter. The results also point to mechanisms not regularly considered in the current debate. Much of the increase, such as it is, has been due to trends in educational attainment, rather than changes in the organization or practice of medicine. Meanwhile, the post-1983 deceleration and reversal has been due, in large part, to population aging. Implications are discussed with respect to the centrality of education in shaping the meaning of and demand for health, as well as the double-edged nature of contemporary medicalization.
1	Existing research rarely examines the social consequences of poor childhood health from a longitudinal perspective Using data from the British National Child Development Study, I follow a cohort from before birth through middle age to examine whether children s health limitations before and during the educational process predict occupational skill in mid-adulthood, and whether negative consequences are strongest for children in persistently poor health I also examine whether differences in achievement explain the observed associations, and at what point during the schooling process performance begins to play a large explanatory role Poor health is strongly negatively related to qualifications in adulthood particularly for children in persistently poor health These associations are largely explained by differences in performance early in children's academic careers, before the first important transition point The relationship between prenatal maternal smoking and mid-adulthood qualifications is more persistent This article demonstrates that a static conceptualization of childhood health is inadequate to fully understand the dynamic process through which social status and health over the course of childhood have long-run consequences for the adult life course
0	This study focuses on immigrant parenting strategies in South Korea. How do immigrant parents raise children in host societies while facing diverse resource restraints? How do they understand ‘the rules of the game’ that native parents follow and shape their parenting strategies? To answer these questions, this study analyzes data from in-depth interviews with 31 immigrant mothers and 13 native mothers in South Korea. This study found two preeminent strategies among immigrant mothers. Some immigrant mothers emulate native mothers, reasoning that children will not be disadvantaged if they are raised according to the rules of game that native mothers follow. However, other immigrant mothers adopt more proactive strategies called ‘transnational mothering.’ They use diverse transnational resources tied to their homeland, including linguistic and local knowledge. The result shows that these parenting styles are the results of social interaction not only between immigrant mothers and the host society but also between them and their homelands. This study can contribute to understanding immigrant parenting strategies and expand on the previous literature on Western society.
0	Society implements a thinness norm by bombarding consumers with media and magazine images which proscribe an unrealistic body image. Current norms stipulate a Barbie like appearance for females while valuing larger, more muscular imposing males. Few individuals are able to attain this ideal goal, leaving them socially isolated, alienated and labeled as deviant. Although feminist and structural-conflict theories have been utilized to address this issue from the micro perspective, we propose that examining this norm from the cultural perspective might allow us to gain insight into the reason that large groups and specific strata of people are now obsessed with size, weight and image.
0	Substantial conflicts arise over access to and management of finite and uncertain resources within a post-Fordist regulatory context that focuses on participatory decision making and attempts to negotiate efforts toward greater sustainability with entrenched values, perceptions and institutional relationships which were derived through Fordist principles.  We examine how the complexity of these social relationships in Nebraskas Republican River Basin challenge attempts to achieve sustainable water resource management policy.  The social relationships surrounding water resource management are also interwoven with ecological and environmental systems, requiring that scholars and practitioners alike recognize and work within these coupled ecological and social systems to achieve sustainable regulatory policy.  We examine the implications of this model for socio-political structure within and between local communities within the Republican River Basin.  In particular, we look at the role of trust in how it relates to regulatory success and participatory decision making.  Last, this post-Fordist regulatory context represents a transition within the politics of established communities and institutions in Southwest Nebraska.
1	In this article, I propose a three-stage estimation model to examine the effect of parental divorce on the development of children's cognitive skills and noncognitive traits. Using a framework that includes pre-, in-, and post-divorce time periods, I disentangle the complex factors affecting children of divorce. I use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class 1998 to 1999 (ECLS-K), a multiwave longitudinal dataset, to assess the three-stage model. To evaluate the parameters of interest more rigorously, I employ a stage-specific ordinary least squares (OLS) model, a counterfactual matching estimator, and a piece-wise growth curve model. Within some combinations of developmental domains and stages, in particular from the in-divorce stage onward, I find negative effects of divorce even after accounting for selection factors that influence children's skills and traits at or before the beginning of the dissolution process. These negative outcomes do not appear to intensify or abate in the ensuing study period.
0	"Paul Atkinson (1997, 2009) and others have criticized a common practice in contemporary illness narratives:  uncritical embrace of the narrative interview, without subjecting such data to the critical scrutiny other data typically receive. Failure to at least strive for objective, skeptical assessment of the data risks abdicating a sociologist's core duty to explore, understand, and explain the social world in realist terms.  As Sandeloski (2002) has observed, this also limits our potential to offer practical, useful suggestions for improving medical practice and patient care.  This paper therefore proposes a ""forensic"" approach to collecting and interpreting illness narrative data.  Drawing from examples of inquiry such as aviation post-crash investigations, or combat after-action reports, this approach elicits narrative testimony but, rather than stopping there and basing any recommendations on a ""face-value"" acceptance of the narrative, it uses the narrative as its point of departure.  It attempts to collect as much supplementary, complementary data as possible (interviews with family and medical staff, written or other records, etc.) to re-construct the fullest possible picture of the illness.  It privileges no source of data, is unsentimental and objective in tone, and attempts to situate illness narrative testimony in its wider context.  As such, it enables illness narratives to make added contributions to social knowledge and medical practice.  Potential limitations include extra logistical demands of pursuing multiple data sources, difficulties with ethics approval, and the immense sensitivity required to maintain trust and rapport."

The data used are qualitative interviews (N=45) with married couples who had been offered HIV testing in their homes in the course of their participation in the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project, a population-based survey.  This paper explores how women strategize within the constraints of patriarchy to exercise their marital power when presented with the opportunity to be HIV tested.  Three sources of women’s marital power are identified.  First, the act of HIV testing and knowledge of serostatus empowers women in their marriages, and helps them persuade their husbands to get tested.  Second, the occasion of HIV testing gives women an opportunity to discuss infidelity – both directly and through references to the couple’s “shared fate”.  Finally, couple counseling levels the playing field between husband and wife by ensuring equal knowledge in the marriage.
1	The expansion of global trade in the post-war period is subject to various interpretations. Some stress the trade-promoting role of the novel features in the world economy; some insist on the role of traditional factors, such as geographic distance, political difference and cultural dissimilarity, in continuously depressing trade flows; others even argue that the importance of these traditional factors has been on the rise. To adjudicate the divergence, this article applies the gravity model to a large data set on global bilateral trade from 1950 through 2000. Although the global institutional factor does promote bilateral trade and global economic activity indeed becomes more trade-generating, the trade-depressing effects of geographic distance, political difference and cultural dissimilarity remain strong. Moreover, geographic and cultural proximity actually generates greater gravity over time that draws countries together, which may trigger fragmentation in global trade along geo-cultural lines.
1	This study, drawing on approximately 1,100 males from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, demonstrates the importance of genetics, and genetic-environmental interactions, for understanding adolescent delinquency and violence. Our analyses show that three genetic polymorphisms-specifically, the 30-bp promoter-region variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in MAOA, the 40-bp VNTR in DAT1, and the Taq1 polymorphism in DRD2-are significant predictors of serious and violent delinquency when added to a social-control model of delinquency. Importantly, findings also show that the genetic effects of DRD2 and MAOA are conditional and interact with family processes, school processes, and friendship networks. These results, which are among the first that link molecular genetic variants to delinquency, significantly expand our understanding of delinquent and violent behavior and they highlight the need to simultaneously consider their social and genetic origins.
1	Existing sociological theories highlight five explanations of development, which focus on leftist political parties in state power, women's office-holding, state capacity, social capital and resource mobilization, and state expenditure. Increasingly, however, the execution of development schemes by large democratic states of the global South relies on citizen participation in what I define as Redistributive Direct Democracy (RDD). RDD institutions devolve formal authorities and create political opportunities for participants to themselves allocate and claim development benefits. Within India's approximately two million local governments, a permanent RDD institution called the gram sabha offers all participants the formal, constitutional authority to directly select recipients of state benefits such as public housing and latrines. Drawing on fixed-effects, multivariate OLS analyses of data collected in a stratified random sample of 72 Indian local governments with active gram sabhas, I argue for a sixth, complementary explanation of development in democracies of the global South: women's participation in RDD. My analysis demonstrates strongly positive and highly significant effects of women's gram sabha participation on local development and a contrasting absence of support for longstanding explanations. These findings suggest that women's participation in RDD can make these new and popular, but poorly understood institutions matter for development outcomes.
1	This article uses the puzzle of Christian success in Korea to develop a model for understanding religious diffusion beyond national borders. The authors argue that the microlevel network explanations that dominate the research on conversion cannot by themselves account for the unusual success of Protestantism in Korea. Instead, events in East Asia in macrolevel, geopolitical networks provoked nationalist rituals that altered the stakes of conversion to either promote or retard conversion network growth. At the turn of the 20th century, unequal treaties both opened this region to missionaries and provoked nationalist rituals. In China and Japan, these rituals generated patriotic identities by attacking Christianity, and network growth slowed or reversed. In Korea, Christianity became compatible with these rituals, and conversion networks grew. This example highlights the greater explanatory power of nested networks for understanding international religious diffusion, relative to microlevel accounts alone.
0	This article draws from 49 qualitative interviews to explore the contextual antecedents of methamphetamine use in a sample of gay and bisexual Manhattan men.  The paper distinguishes itself from the public health literature on crystal methamphetamine use in this population by shifting the analytic focus from individual-level factors of drug use to the role of social context.  While individual-level factorsincluding self esteem and social awkwardnessare surely related to methamphetamine use, we argue that these factors arise in and are exacerbated by the normative interactional patterns and pressures of Manhattans gay sexual subculture, which revolve around intensive and sustained sexual performance and sexual competition.  Hence, we suggest there exists an elective affinity between Manhattans gay sexual subculture and the use of methamphetaminethe latter which induces psychophysiological effects that help gay and bisexual participants negotiate the interactional pressures attendant to sexual sociality.  In short, we highlight the relationship of Manhattans gay sexual subculture to drug taking motivations, and, in turn, to unsafe sexual practicesi.e., the social conditions that put gay men at risk of risk of drug use and HIV infection (Link & Phelan 1995:85).
0	When China opened its economic borders for trade in 1978, American producers of popular culture pounced on this new market.  American music has taken a prominent place in Chinese society, but the most popular genres may seem odd to cosmopolitan Americans.  The most well-liked genres are easy listening, country, and oldies, and the popularity of these types of music has to do with both their high status as American and English-language products and their themes of home and love, which resonate with much of the Chinese population.  The social world of Chinese culture makes these genres more acceptable than music with harder sounds and controversial themes.  As China emerges as a major player in the international arena, its traditional values find expression in the &#8220;light&#8221; music of America.
0	The school-to-prison pipeline refers to the increased presence of criminal justice control mechanisms such as metal detectors and law enforcement in secondary education institutions and leads one to question its effect on the increasing number of girls encountering the juvenile justice system. The increasing criminalization of young women of color and the increasing presence of police officers on urban high school campuses is disturbing and resemble a modern reproduction of enclosure projects and new terroristic tactics of social control. In this paper I focus on the effect the school-to-prison pipeline has on young females of color. I also examine how girls’ deviance is viewed by School Resource Officers (SRO) and how their relabeling of status as more violent or serious offenses increases the arrest and referrals of young females to the juvenile justice system. I argue that the increasing involvement of girls in the juvenile justice system (either incarcerated or under some form of juvenile justice supervision) is related to the increased presence of SRO’s and other law enforcement tools in urban high schools that heighten policing of girls deviance. I show how the relabeling of status offenses as deviant and the increasing presence of SRO’s in schools are leading to an increase in arrests for girls and resulting in more girls incarcerated. The school-to-prison pipeline is increasing the occurrence of girls’ encounters with the juvenile justice system, leaving them with the label of deviant. This creates additional barriers to education and other life opportunities for young women of color.
1	"Imagined futures, once a vital topic of theoretical inquiry within the sociology of culture, have been sidelined in recent decades. Rational choice models cannot explain the seemingly irrational optimism of youth aspirations, pointing to the need to explore other alternatives. This article incorporates insights from pragmatist theory and cognitive sociology to examine the relationship between imagined futures and present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling, the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort, unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a virtuous identity, claims to be ""one who aspires."""
1	In this study, we measure the contribution of immigrants and their descendents to the growth and industrial transformation of the American workforce in the age of mass immigration from 1880 to 1920. The size and selectivity of the immigrant community, as well as their disproportionate residence in large cities, meant they were the mainstay of the American industrial workforce. Immigrants and their children comprised over half of manufacturing workers in 1920, and if the third generation (the grandchildren of immigrants) are included, then more than two-thirds of workers in the manufacturing sector were of recent immigrant stock. Although higher wages and better working conditions might have encouraged more long-resident native-born workers to the industrial economy, the scale and pace of the American industrial revolution might well have slowed. The closing of the door to mass immigration in the 1920s did lead to increased recruitment of native born workers, particularly from the South, to northern industrial cities in the middle decades of the 20th century. 
0	What happens to service work when organizations change?  This paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork in Hotel BAUEN, a worker-recovered hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, that was occupied by its workers and reorganized as a worker cooperative.  In this alternative service workplace, insights into the dynamics of a “service triangle” made up of worker, owner and consumer shift as workers become worker-owners, providing a different venue to explore how structural variation transforms service interaction.  This article begins by adding dimension to the range of products and services produced and consumed, linking different products to diverse consumers that participate in interactive service work. It, then, considers workers’ emphasis on self-management as a form of emotional labor that is required not only in the service interaction with the customer, but in other sites with different parties to complicate understandings of emotional labor as a standard, commodified or managed effort.  By taking a broader view of the product being sold, the consumer being served and the worker being managed, the case of Hotel BAUEN exposes how workplace structure transforms workers’ experience of their service labor by increasing the emotional demands of work.
1	Rising economic disparities in the United States at the end of the twentieth century make understanding the severity and determinants of residential segregation between the affluent and poor increasingly important. Existing studies are limited, however, by little attention to the spatial configuration of class segregation. Segregation occurs along multiple spatial dimensions-the affluent and poor may be split not only between different neighborhoods, but concentrated over more or less land, more or less centralized, and clustered near or far from other similar neighborhoods. Each dimension affects the amount of contact and shared resources between groups differently, and overlaps between them produce particularly severe social isolation. Theories conflict over the spatial form of class segregation, with the concentric zone model expecting the affluent to be clustered in large-lot developments on the metropolitan fringe and critics proposing alternative spatial forms in a more patchwork pattern. I use U.S. Census summary data for all metropolitan areas in 2000 to test competing theories of the patterns and determinants of the spatial form of affluent-poor segregation using cluster and regression analysis. l identify two dominant spatial forms of affluent-poor segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas in 2000, and find that racial diversity and segregation are key determinants of which spatial form characterizes a metropolitan area. The links between poverty, prosperity, and place were therefore crucially shaped by race as well as economic disparities in the age of extremes.
0	In the context of fiercely debated integration problems and Dutch national identity issues, the Dutch government demanded the construction of a historical canon. In this paper, we show how the past is instrumentalized for national-identity construction by the government. Moreover, we analyse the highly ambivalent attitude of the professional historians, first rejecting the political instrumentalization of the past, followed by an ambiguous embracement of nevertheless doing so. We suggest this ambiguity towards history should be understood as emanating from a specific Dutch national self-image: “decent Dutchness”.
0	This paper examines how rules of exchange, trust, conceptions of fairness in markets, and social organizations shape market structure and actor participation. Empirical work centers on the creation of eBay, one of the largest online retailers. eBay is an excellent real world case for engaging what existing economic and sociological theories have to say about markets, market structure, pricing, information, and market institutions. By examining market formation as a social process, the sociological approach raises the question of how actorsindividuals, organizations, associations, etc.are constituted in markets. The case of eBay in the United States demonstrates that markets including conceptions of fair competition, understandings of trust, uncertainty and collective solutions to those problems, etc. are socially constructed. The case also shows that markets are locally contingent.
0	This paper explores the controversy surrounding former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick and his involvement in dogfighting.  Drawing on a diverse body of work, we discuss some of the ways in which dogs have come to hold vastly different meanings for African-Americans than for whites.  We contextualize the deeply raced responses to dogfighting in these different histories of cultural meaning, and explore the implications of these observations for further study.
1	This article investigates how changes in educational assortative mating affected the growth in earnings inequality among households in the United States between the late 1970s and early 2000s. The authors find that these changes had a small, negative effect on inequality: there would have been more inequality in earnings in the early 2000s if educational assortative mating patterns had remained as they were in the 1970s. Given the educational distribution of men and women in the United States, educational assortative mating can have only a weak impact on inequality, and educational sorting among partners is a poor proxy for sorting on earnings.
0	In response to increases in child obesity in recent decades, reaching 17% of elementary school children by 2006, many states, districts, and schools have limited or eliminated the sale of sweetened beverages at school. The impact of these policies on actual consumption of sweetened beverages and on weight trajectories has not been sufficiently evaluated. Using a large nationally representative longitudinal dataset, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K), this study explores the relationship between children’s access to sweetened beverages at school beginning in fifth grade, their consumption of such beverages and their weight changes over three years. We find that children who can buy beverages at school (according to their own reports or to school administrator reports) are not more likely to be obese and have not gained more weight over a period of two years compared with children who cannot make such purchases at school. In addition, weight trajectories are not different among children who reported that they did purchase sweetened beverages at school compared with those who did not.
1	Using data from two waves of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (N = 8,054), I examine gender differences in psychological adjustment to cancer among older white adults. Results from different types of longitudinal models reveal that cancer has more adverse psychological implications for men than women. Men's higher levels of depression are reduced after adjustment for adherence to masculinity ideals of strength, independence and invincibility. Cancer poses a threat to the masculine identity because it entails lack of control over one's body and other consequences incompatible with traditional masculinity. This study contributes to sociological knowledge of the ways in which gender shapes psychological resilience and vulnerability to cancer through meanings people attach to gender roles.
1	Previous research into the social distribution of early life depression has yielded inconsistent results regarding the causes and course of subgroup depression disparities. This study examines the topic by analyzing National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data, modeling gender and racial/ethnic differences in early life depression trajectories and investigating the influences of stress and socioeconomic status. Results indicate females and minorities experience elevated depressive symptoms across early life compared to males and whites. SES and stressful life events explain much of the racial/ethnic disparities. Blacks, Hispanics and females show greater sensitivity to the effects of low SES, and in the case of females, SLEs. Overall, this study develops a nuanced, dynamic model of the multiplicative effects of social disadvantage on early life depression disparities.
1	Education is weakly related to employment for some groups of US. women. As such, it may be less of a resource for reducing gender inequality than commonly believed. Drawing on ethnographic field notes and in-depth interviews with Arab Americans, we recast the motivations and consequences of female education in terms of cultural schemas and resources and then analyze the processes that underlie the education-employment link in ethnic and religious contexts. Arab American women are a particularly useful case study because they have higher educational attainments but lower employment rates than most other groups of US. women. Our findings shed light on this paradox. Arab Americans universally support female education as a resource, not for economic mobility, but to ensure the proper socialization of children, solidarity of the family, and ultimately the maintenance of ethnic and religious identity. Contrary to the widely held assumption that female education will equalize gender power dynamics, our results highlight how and when women education may reproduce patriarchal gender relations. This is the case in religious and ethnic contexts where women forgo market opportunities to fuffill familial responsibilities, and where parents and children view female education as a collective family resource-a resource to be invested in the home rather than in the market.
1	We draw on conversation analytic methods and research to explicate the interactional phenomenon of requesting in general and the specific case of requesting participation in survey interviews. Recent work on survey participation gives much attention to leverage-saliency theory but does not explore how the key concepts of this theory are exhibited in the actual unfolding interaction of interviewers and potential respondents. We examine interaction using digitally recorded and transcribed calls to recruit participation in the 2004 Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. We describe how potential respondents present interactional environments that are relatively discouraging or encouraging, and how, in response, interviewers may be relatively cautious or presumptive in their requesting actions. We consider how interviewers' ability to tailor their behavior to their interactional environments can affect whether an introduction reaches the point at which a request to participate is made, the form that this request takes, and the sample person's response. This article contributes to understanding the social action of requesting and specifically how we might use insights from analyses of interaction to increase cooperation with requests to participate in surveys.
0	Scale shift –a process that involves the coordination of collective action at a different level than where it began– is assumed to be important for the spread of contention and lawmaking. Empirical research, however, has ignored the role of scale shift, focusing primarily on factors such as social movement organizations, public opinion, political climate or the interaction between them. We investigate how bottom-up scale shift affects the spread of immigration-related legislation. Our preliminary quantitative and qualitative research shows that scale shift played an important role for the spread of anti-immigration legislation, but not for the pro-immigrant legislation. We discuss the main implications and present plans for further developing our research.
0	Individual health is not static nor can it be divorced from the cumulative impacts of lived experience. Because its basic theoretical and methodological insight is to recognize that individual life circumstances and the events that shape them are best understood in the context of previous events and circumstances, the life course perspective has the potential to provide great insight into the factors and processes that shape health. This study examines the impact of early life circumstances on life course health trajectories. Specifically, it investigates the effect of poor infant and childhood health and of parental socioeconomic status on both overall level of adult health and disability as well their trajectories over time. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and latent growth curve models I estimate the effects of early life health and social circumstances on both the overall level (latent intercept) and slope of adult health trajectories.
0	The development of the global gay movement is increasingly visible on the international stage with the multi-national emergence of largely independent gay and lesbian rights movements.  However, the accumulation of comparative cross-cultural research on the gay movement has not kept pace with the development of this topic. One of several likely reasons for this lag lies in the difficulty of conducting meaningfully-comparative studies on movements that take place in different social, political, and cultural circumstances.  By implementing the semantic differential and logic of affect control theory, we provide a means to overcome this research barrier and offer new insight into the mechanisms that enable or impede the development of gay movements.  In this study, we examine gay movements in five countries: Canada, China, Germany, Japan, and the United States.  We compare the affective meanings of identities: man, woman, and homosexual in each of these countries to ascertain the relative favorability of its cultural environment to the aims of its gay movement.  We find that the relative affective meanings of these selected identities closely reflect the actual developmental trends in the gay movements of each country and capture important differences between them.
0	Adolescent peer groups are usually homophilous; individuals tend to be grouped with like individuals. However, what happens when an individuals minority status is (1) not socially visible and (2) developed over time in fluid stages? The likelihood of finding like peers with whom to network most likely decreases leading to a greater chance of social isolation. Peers are vital for Queer adolescents because they often are ostracized from the family, church, and school. Using two facets of sexual identity, Queer attraction and Queer behavior, I more fully examine how Queer identity functions in adolescent social networks. Further, I assess whether social network position differs for Queer boys and Queer girls. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, I conduct the first national analysis of Queer adolescents and social network position. I find that Queer girls are more isolated than Queer boys if they report having a romantic relationship with someone of the same-sex.
0	Does racism explain why perpetrators kill in genocides? In research on the Rwandan genocide, many argue that racism explains why Hutu killed their Tutsi neighbors. In this paper, I argue that while these studies demonstrate that the categories of “Hutu” and “Tutsi” mattered for the unfolding of genocide in Rwanda, few explain the process by which social relationships tore along racial lines, nor do they explain the meanings of these categories for local-level perpetrators- those who performed the majority of the killings. This study uses a convenient sample of 21 local-level perpetrators to identify what motivated perpetrators’ participation in the Rwandan genocide and whether racism inspired their decisions to kill. Findings suggest that three processes made race a salient cleavage and motivated participation in genocide, but racism itself does not explain perpetrators’ motivations. The processes are: (1) a critical event that causes acute insecurity at the local level, (2) explicit communications by political leaders that encourages actors to align with racial, as opposed to other, reference groups, and (3) public displays of Hutu-on-Tutsi violence by hardliners and local authorities that signal racial violence as the order of the day. In many cases, coercion is a fourth factor influencing perpetrator participation, but it is not a necessary one. These findings suggest new avenues of research for investigating the significance of racism for genocide.
1	Although recent scholarship has emphasized the importance of examining the rewards of raising children in understanding variations in psychological consequences of parenthood, empirical research remains focused on the demands of parenthood. Using a sample of parents with children aged 0-22 in the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 6228), this paper examines the association between age of children and parental psychological well-being, focusing on a key element of rewards of parenthood, parental relationship satisfaction with their children, as a mediator of the link. Findings indicate that parents whose oldest child is under age five report higher satisfaction with the relationship with their children, higher self-esteem, higher self-efficacy, and less depression than do parents whose oldest child is school-age or adolescent. When parental satisfaction is taken into account, the differences in self-esteem, self-efficacy, and depression by age of children disappear. 
0	The current sociological literature has only recently begun to reconsider the role of ideas, ideology, cultural signs and symbols in influencing the timing and content of social welfare policies. Little is currently known about the specific processes through which political actors ideas and ideologies interact with their material interests to affect political action and public policy. While recent scholarship has revived the notion that ideas matter in policy-making, more attention needs to be paid to systematically unpacking this relationship. In his review of the literature on the role of ideas in politics and public policy, Campbell (2002) contends that most accounts of policymaking leave largely unexplained exactly how ideas and ideology influence and constrain political actors behavior and decision-making. This paper will seek to help fill this gap in the literature by examining the role the Russell Sage Foundation (RSF) played in crafting and advocating for consumer loan legislation in the early twentieth century. Because the political success of the Foundation depended on its ability to present its recommendations as scientific, neutral and not based on self interest, it provides an excellent case for examining how ideas and ideology, rather than simply material interests, inspire political action and influence social welfare policy making. This paper will also explore how ideas and ideologies change as their advocates are confronted with competing interests, institutional constraints, and new knowledge.
1	This paper examines the effect of climate on migration. We examine whether climate is an influential factor in internal migration. We assume that most persons tend to avoid exposure to bitter and cold winters, and excessively hot and humid Summers, preferring climates between these extremes. When engaging in-migration decision-making, therefore, to the extent possible, considerations involving climate are believed to be brought into the calculus. There is a very limited demographic literature on the effects of climate on migration.
0	The experience of work and retirement in later life has become increasingly varied over the past forty years. However, little is known about how public- and private- retirement provisions impact the transactions between labor force statues in the emergent retirement landscape. This problem is analyzed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling and data from the Health and Retirement Study. Results suggest that both public- and private- benefits generally increase transitions to retirement and decrease transitions to unemployment or to increased work. However, because private benefits are not equally distributed throughout the population, the results is a two tiered system of retirement provisions: a disadvantaged group that relies solely on public provisions, and an advantaged group that supplements their public benefits with private pensions and employer provided insurance.
0	In this paper I address the question of whether and how new occupations emerge amidst industrial change.  I focus on the case of New York Citys new and rapidly changing new media industry, and in particular on the industrys web production workers.  In order to assess occupational formation, I use work history data to develop an analysis of new media labor flows.  A labor flow is an aggregate movement of workers from one shared occupation (or organization, industry, or region) to another, using at least some of the same intermediate steps.  Here I examine labor flows among various types of new media work for continuities and discontinuities that might indicate the presence of occupational boundaries.  Using Abbotts (1995) ideal-typical definition of occupations as a criterion, I find that only one type of new media work constitutes an occupation that is robust across job transitions.  Other new media work is best understood as constituting a single modular occupation, in which each job is built anew from a limited range of standard work types.
1	Research suggests that community-level poverty is associated with access to health care net of individual-level characteristics, but no research investigates whether this association differs by individual-level income. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, the US. Census Bureau and the Health Resource and Services Administration, I find that the negative relationship between the prevalence of poverty in communities and access to health care is much stronger for middle- and high-income individuals than for those in lower-income groups. I suggest that individuals may benefit from living among those in similar economic circumstances because they face similar obstacles to obtaining medical are. For poor individuals, the collective knowledge and experience embedded in poor communities may compensate for the otherwise negative influence of community-level poverty.
1	We suggest that new forms of family households, especially same-sex couples and single parents, are likely to face discrimination in their interactions with rental markets. Following the contact hypothesis, we hypothesize that the geographic distribution of discrimination is likely to vary Specifically, in places with more new family households we are likely to find less discrimination against these households. We investigate these issues in the metropolitan area of Vancouver, Canada, through analysis of 1,669 inquiries made about one- and two-bedroom apartments. Using afield experimental design similar to audit studies, we analyze landlord responses to five different two-person household scenarios, including one heterosexual couple, two same-sex couples, and two single parents. Evidence suggests that male same-sex couples, single mothers, and single fathers all face significant discrimination relative to heterosexual couples. The contact hypothesis was supported for male same-sex couples, but not for single parents. This could indicate that single parents are facing discrimination primarily based upon their economic marginalization rather than other forms of prejudice.
1	"Social activists and especially insurgents have created solidary cultures of resistance in conditions of high risk and repression. One such instance is an episode of contention by Irish political prisoners in the late 1970s. The ""blanketmen"" appropriated and then built a solidary culture within spaces that had been under official control. Their ability to maintain such a collective response was enhanced by an intensifying cycle of protest and violent reprisal, including extreme stripping of their material environment, in which the prisoners gained considerable initiative. This study uses interviews and contemporary writings by prisoners, prison authorities, visitors, and movement activists to examine how the dynamic of protest and repression transformed insurgent prison culture-through material, emotional, and perceptive changes-and the importance of leadership in the transformation. Special attention is given to prisoner activities in appropriated spaces that reinforced the culture of resistance: promoting the Irish language, cultural production, and the production of propaganda."
1	Our research uses two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to analyze the stability of same- and cross-race friendships. We find the following: First, interracial friendships are less stable than same-race friendships, even after controlling for a variety of contextual and dyadic characteristics, such as school racial composition and friends' similarities in attitudes and behaviors. Second, measures of dyadic similarity (aside from race) are weak predictors of friendship stability. Third, measures of reciprocity and closeness are strong predictors of friendship stability and appear to dampen the effects of racial difference. These results indicate that race is of continuing significance in structuring the social lives of American adolescents. They call into question the assumption that the factors that drive friendship formation also drive friendship stability. And, they suggest that more attention should be paid to the quality of interracial friendships, as measured by degree of reciprocity and closeness.
1	The research presented here weighs the ability of two major explanations of social inequality-Massey and Denton's racial segregation explanation and Wilson's emphasis on economic deprivation (concentrated poverty)-to predict environmental inequality. Two sets of logistic regression analyses are used to predict the location of Superfund sites in Portland, Oregon and Detroit, Michigan providing a conditional understanding of environmental inequality within a larger sociological context. The analysis includes a general examination of the two theories in all census tracts in both cities and a set of analyses focusing upon Black neighborhoods in Detroit. The findings indicate that there is support for explanations of environmental inequality that include both racial segregation and economic deprivation, but that the more powerful of the two is economic deprivation. The results suggest that even though African-American neighborhoods disproportionately house Superfund sites, these facilities are more likely to be located in Black neighborhoods that are economically deprived. 
0	This article uses conversation analysis to investigate presentations of depression or other affective concerns in primary care medical visits.  Three broad methods for topicalization of these concerns are identified: (1) Direct presentations, where the patient directly names their concern and provides it as a reason for the visit. (2) Indirect presentations, where a problem with affect is named by the patient but it is provided as a tangential element of the visit. (3) Physician Articulated, where the patient does not articulate an affective concern and the physician does so in response to the patients presentation of physical symptoms.  Through the coordination of the design and placement of these concerns both patients and physicians systematically treat problems with affect as stigmatized conditions.  The implication of this research is that conversational norms, both medical and non-medical, work against topicalization and subsequent identification and treatment of problems with affect in primary care practices.  These presentations can be treated as resources for learning more about barriers to diagnosis and treatment of depression and anxiety.
1	This paper examines how the military drawdown in the early 1990s influenced aggregate trends in employment and college enrollment, evaluating whether the loss of military jobs resulted in observable increases or decreases in employment rates and/or college enrollment rates. Contrary to the expectation of worsening employment among black men in particular, the drawdown had little effect on employment. However, changes in military service did have a considerable impact on college enrollment among black men. The loss of military jobs was actually associated with substantial increases in college going; college enrollments among black men may have been as much as 10% points lower had they served in the military at the same levels observed in the early 1980s.

1	The relevance of family income for religious participation in the United States has been largely ignored in recent decades. Addressing this neglect, we focus our attention primarily upon white Catholics, the poorer of whom we reason have fewer options to participate in the context of an increasingly middle-class Church. Analyzing the 1972-2006 cumulative General Social Survey data, we show that net of all other factors low-income white Catholics attend church less often than other white Catholics, although social integration mechanisms significantly moderate the effects of income. Additional analyses suggest that the effects of income on church attendance are greatest for the younger white Catholic cohort. In contrast, the role of income in Latino Catholics' attendance is relatively weak. In our conclusion, we attempt to integrate our most puzzling finding - having children in the home does not increase the church attendance of low-income white Catholics - with our main theoretical line of argument concerning the central role of social integration in understanding the impact of income on religious participation.
1	Persistent racial residential segregation is often seen as the result of preferences: whites prefer to live with whites while blacks wish to live near many other blacks. Are these neighborhood preferences color-blind or race conscious? Does neighborhood racial composition have a net influence upon preferences, or is race a proxy for social class? This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood's residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all-white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African-Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African-Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition.
1	The ways in which immigrant health profiles change with shifts in acculturation is of increasing interest to scholars and policy makers in the United States, but little is known about the mechanisms that may link acculturation and self-rated health, particularly for Asians. Utilizing the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) and its data on foreign-born Latinos (N = 1,199) and Asians (N = 1,323) (Pennell et al. 2004), we investigate and compare the associations between acculturation and self-rated health for immigrants to the United States from six major ethnic subgroups 
1	"Evidence on the relationship between political contributions and legislators' voting behavior is marred by concerns about endogeneity in the estimation process. Using a legislator's offspring sex mix as a truly exogenous variable, we employ an instrumental variable estimation procedure to predict the effect of voting behavior on political contributions. Following previous research, we find that a legislator's proportion daughters has a significant effect on voting behavior for women's issues, as measured by score in the ""Congressional Record on Choice"" issued by NARAL Pro-Choice America. In the second stage, we make a unique contribution by demonstrating a significant impact of exogenous voting behavior on PAC contributions, lending further credibility to the hypothesis that Political Action Committees respond to legislators' voting patterns by ""rewarding"" political candidates that vote in line with the positions of the PAC, rather than affecting those same votes - at least in this high-profile policy domain.

0	This article explores the use of sacrifice as a mechanism that enhances commitment in egalitarian intentional communities. Using Kanters theoretical framework on commitment mechanisms among utopian groups, this works seeks to understand how contemporary communal living groups are using sacrifice to increase member retention.  As members seek to justify their dietary and monetary sacrifices through a shared belief of moral superiority over the mainstream culture, they enhance their own ideological reasons for joining as well as solidify their commitment to the group. This research is based on ethnographic data collected in four egalitarian intentional communities in the United States.
1	The authors employ multiple theories within a political economy framework to examine the structural predictors of the per capita ecological footprints of nations. Engaged theories include ecological modernization, treadmill of production, treadmill of destruction, and ecologically unequal exchange. Results of cross-national panel regression models indicate that the treadmill of production in the context of economic development increases per capita footprints, which contradicts general claims of ecological modernization theory. Similarly, the treadmill of destruction in the mode of military expenditures per soldier positively affects per capita footprints. Those with relatively higher levels of exports sent to economically developed and militarily powerful nations experience suppressed consumption levels, and these effects are especially pronounced and increasingly so for less-developed countries, many of which consume resources well below globally sustainable thresholds. The latter sets of findings support key elements of ecologically unequal exchange theory. Ultimately, this research suggests that a political economy framework that considers domestic attributes and structural relationships in particular contexts is quite useful for understanding the consumption-based environmental harms of nations.
1	"Ex-prisoners tend to be geographically concentrated in a relatively small number of neighborhoods within the most resource deprived sections of metropolitan areas. Furthermore, many prisoners return ""home"" to the same criminogenic environment with the same criminal opportunities and criminal peers that proved so detrimental prior to incarceration. Yet estimating the causal impact of place of residence on the likelihood of recidivism is complicated by the issue of selection bias. In this study, I use a natural experiment as a means of addressing the selection issue and examine whether the migration of ex-prisoners away from their former place of residence will lead to lower levels of recidivism. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Louisiana Gulf Coast, damaging many of the neighborhoods where ex-prisoners typically reside. The residential destruction resulting from Hurricane Katrina is an exogenous source of variation that influences where a parolee will reside upon release from prison. Findings reveal that moving away from former geographic areas substantially lowers a parolee likelihood of re-incarceration."
1	We examine race differences in delinquency using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. We use a new method that permits an examination of offense specialization. We argue that an examination of offense patterns provides an opportunity for testing theoretical explanations of race effects. If race differences in violent crime reflect race differences in serious crime, then theories of crime can explain race effects. Otherwise, theories of violence are needed to explain the phenomenon. Our results suggest that black adolescents have higher rates of violence, particularly armed violence, but they do not have higher rates of serious (or minor) property or drug crime. Race differences in violence are generally stronger for adolescents who would otherwise be at lower risk: girls and adolescents from educated and intact families. Puerto Rican adolescents also have higher rates of violence than Anglos, but other Hispanic groups do not. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of the empirical literature (including our results) for various theoretical explanations of race differences in violence. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1	"This paper provides new estimates of changing patterns of serial cohabitation, using data from the 1995 and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. Serial cohabitation is defined as having multiple premarital cohabiting relationships. Analyses indicate that rates of serial cohabitation increased by nearly 40 percent over the late 1990s and early 2000s, and rates were especially high among young adults and recent marriage cohorts. A large majority of women - 75 percent - nevertheless lived only with men they eventually married. Although rates of serial cohabitation are higher among never-married women than ever-married women, there is little indication that single women - even older single women - have embraced serial cohabitation as an alternative to marriage or even as an intensive kind of dating. The results show that serial cohabitation is heavily concentrated among disadvantaged populations (e.g., women who grew up in single parent families). Early sexual activity and teen childbearing are especially important ""risk"" factors for serial cohabitation in the never-married population. There is little evidence, however, that recent shifts in the sociodemographic risk profile of the US population have been responsible for observed increases in single-instance or serial cohabitation. Increases in serial cohabitation have been broadly experienced across population groups in America. "
1	"The aim of the factorial survey approach is to uncover the social and individual structures of human judgements of social objects. By having respondents evaluate samples of vignettes (fictive descriptions), in which several factors describing the object of interest are simultaneously manipulated, this approach has a number of advantages over traditional social survey research. The aim of the present article is to provide an easy-to-follow overview of the various ways in which the approach has been applied within sociology between 1982 and 2006. The review, which is based on 106 articles published in central sociology journals, is organised into three different sections: ""factorial survey applications"", ""factorial survey designs"" and ""factorial survey analyses"".

0	By analyzing the Parent and Family Involvement in Education Survey of the National Household Education Surveys Program (PFI-NHES:2007), this study addresses what factors affect parental choice and whether school choice increases parents school satisfaction. This study reveals that the nature of school choice is heavily dependent on a variety of characteristics, including demographic characteristics and socioeconomic background. Black and Hispanic students are more likely to choose schools than White students. As parental education level becomes higher, parents are more likely to choose schools. However, as household income level becomes higher, parents are less likely to choose schools for their kids. Parents in large cities are most likely to choose schools for their kids. Choice parents are more than twice likely to be satisfied with school than nonchoice parents. Parents with female students are more likely to be satisfied with schools than parents with male students. Black parents are least likely to be satisfied with schools. Student academic achievement has a positive impact on parental satisfaction with schools. While parental education level has a slightly positive effect on parental satisfaction, household income level has a slightly negative impact on school satisfaction. How well schools inform parents greatly affect parental satisfaction.
0	Several analyses suggest that states affect the likelihood of broad-based domestic violence.  Such claims, however, are often competing.  Some propose that direct forms of state domination incite nationalist rebellions by reducing local autonomy, while others suggest that direct forms of rule promote high levels of state capacity and thereby limit the possibility of domestic violence.  Unfortunately, the form of state structures has proved difficult to measure historically, and the question of whether and how states affect domestic violence remains unresolved.  In the present paper, we attempt to expand insight into this question.  We operationalize the extent to which state structures are either direct or indirect among a set of 35 former British colonies and show that this measurement is also an excellent historical proxy for the level of state effectiveness.  Using multivariate models that control for other factors, we regress this variable on the intensity of communal conflict, the intensity of domestic rebellion, and the prevalence of civil war between 1960 and 2000.  We find that the structure of states has no significant effect on the dependent variables, suggesting either that states have no effect on domestic violence or that states have competing effects that cancel out one another.
0	In this analysis I examine the spread of Internet Distance Learning (IDL) for graduate education among institutions of higher education.  I posit that IDL is a controversial innovation and thus follows a different pattern of diffusion than the typical pattern described by neoinstitutionalist arguments.  I propose a new theory, Status Contingent Diffusion Theory, which argues that the spread of a controversial innovation is affected by both the status of the organization and the current routines of the organization.  I argue that lower status organizations will adopt IDL first and for a wide range of purposes, while high status organizations will be reluctant to adopt IDL and if they do so will limit the way they offer IDL.  I test this argument with data from U.S. News and World Report and Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS).  The argument proposed by Status Contingent Diffusion Theory is supported by these data.
0	After three decades of suppression, private entrepreneurship became legally permissible in China in the 1980's as part of the market reforms.  This provided social scientists the opportunity to study the emergence  or, more accurately, the construction  of an occupation.  Through ethnographic research at 20 workplaces in the northeast city of Harbin, I discovered that Harbiners understood entrepreneurs not as a single occupation, but as three.  Some entrepreneurs were seen as cadres, and judged by their ability to provide socialist benefits for their employees, rather than their success at generating profits.   Most were considered to be money-grubbing, morally lax peddlers, or getihu.  Yet those who were educated or ran high-tech businesses were never vilified as getihu, but instead seen as good businesspeople.   By living out this three-way division in their own lives, ordinary citizens not only shaped the stratification system in post-socialist Harbin, they also affected the form and direction of marketization.
1	The research reported here used measures of marital success based on both marital survival and marital quality to assess how well first marriages entered at relatively late ages fare in comparison with those entered younger. Analysis of data from five American data sets indicated that the later marriages fare very well in survival but rather poorly in quality. The greatest indicated likelihood of being in an intact marriage of the highest quality is among those who married at ages 22-25, net of the estimated effects of time since first marriage and several variables that might commonly affect age at marriage and marital outcomes. The negative relationship beyond the early to mid-twenties between age at marriage and marital success is likely to be at least partially spurious, and thus it would be premature to conclude that the optimal time for first marriage for most persons is ages 22-25. However, the findings do suggest that most persons have little or nothing to gain in the way of marital success by deliberately postponing marriage beyond the mid-twenties. 
0	Frequently, the terms domination and hegemony are used interchangeably.  Yet, domination has historically involved exploitation and exclusion of subordinate groups in their most explicit and abrasive form.  According to Italian political theorist and activist Antonio Gramsci hegemony allows dominant groups effectively to maintain control and hierarchy but create the illusion of equality by selectively including its subjects and incorporate its opposition.  Accordingly, contemporary black-white relations and race relations generally have shifted away from the racial apartheid of the past, which was based principally on domination.  Formal exclusion based on domination and exclusion increasingly have been juxtaposed with or replaced by hegemonic structures.  Furthermore, the removal of the formal mechanism supporting racial apartheid in turn has led to discussions about the declining significance of race, and the increasing importance of class and culture, as factors that influence social stratification. Through the use of ostensibly colorblind rhetoric many individuals have questioned the necessity of continuing affirmative action and other directives aimed at tracking and eradicating patterns of racial discrimination that supposedly no longer exist.  This rhetoric not only has masked continuing patterns of racial discrimination but also has obscured the selective nature of racial integration, in which a few individuals of colorparticularly from the middle classhave been allowed to gain access to wealth, power, privilege, and prestige.  In fact, there has been a noticeable increased currency of phenotypeparticularly skin coloras a form of racial capital, working in combination with the increasing significance of culture and class.
1	This article demonstrates that value of Foucault's conception of discipline for understanding organization responses to rankings. Using a case study of law schools, we explain why rankings have permeated law schools so extensively and why these organizations have been unable to buffer these institutional pressures. Foucault's depiction of two important processes, surveillance and normalization, show how rankings change perceptions of legal education through both coercive and seductive means. This approach advances organizational theory by highlighting conditions that affect the prevalence and effectiveness of buffering. Decoupling is not determined solely by the external enforcement of institutional pressures or the capacity of organizational actors to buffer or hide some activities. Members' tendency to internalize these pressures, to become self-disciplining, is also salient. Internalization is fostered by the anxiety that rankins produce, by their allure for the administrators who try to manipulate them, and by the resistance they provoke. Rankings are just one example of the public measures of performance that are becoming increasingly influential in many institutional environments, and understanding how organizations respond to these measures is a crucial task for scholars.
1	The degree to which children grow up in crowded housing is a neglected but potentially important aspect of social inequality. Poor living conditions can serve as a mechanism of social stratification, affecting children's wellbeing and resulting in the intergenerational transmission of social inequality. This paper reports an investigation of housing crowding on children's academic achievement, behavior, and health in the US and Los Angeles, a city with atypically high levels of crowding. We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics' Child Development Supplement and the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey to explore the effect of living in a crowded home on an array of child wellbeing indicators. We find that several dimensions of children's wellbeing suffer when exposed to crowded living conditions, particularly in Los Angeles, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. The negative effects on children raised in crowded homes can persist throughout life, affecting their future socioeconomic status and adult wellbeing. 
1	Studies of teen dating violence have focused heavily on family and peer influences, but little research has been conducted on the relationship contexts within which violence occurs. The present study explores specific features of adolescent romantic relationships associated with the perpetration of physical violence. Relying on personal interviews with a sample of 956 adolescents, results indicate that respondents who self-report violence perpetration are significantly more likely than their non-violent counterparts to report higher levels of other problematic relationship dynamics and behaviors such as jealousy, verbal conflict, and cheating. However, we find no significant differences in levels of love, intimate self-disclosure, or perceived partner caring, and violent relationships are, on average, characterized by longer duration, more frequent contact, sexual intimacy and higher scores on the provision and receipt of instrumental support. Finally, violence is associated with the perception of a relatively less favorable power balance, particularly among male respondents. These findings complicate traditional views of the dynamics within violent relationships, add to our understanding of risk factors, and may also shed light on why some adolescents remain in physically abusive relationships. 
1	Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS), this study examines the unique and collective impact of cognitive skills and noncognitive behaviors in high school on educational attainment and earnings for a tenth grade cohort, 10 years later in 2000. The results indicate that students with better social skills, work habits, and who participated in extracurricular activities in high school had higher educational attainment and earnings, even after controlling for cognitive skills. Skills and behaviors in high school also explain a substantial portion of the socioecononomic, sex, and racial and ethnic gaps in educational attainment and earnings. 
0	"The internationalization of contemporary art is not new; what is new is the constitution of a global or worldwide art market, which is organized with two poles: the USA and Europe (mainly Germany, but also Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland and France at a minor level). Considering the art market, the artistic capitals are New York and London for auctions, but also, for art fairs, Basel and, at a minor level, New York, Chicago, Berlin, Cologne, Paris, and Madrid. On one hand, there is thus, at the international level, a high degree of centralization, and on the other hand, a diversity of art worlds and a fragmentation of the art market. The articulation of largely national artistic field (in terms of notoriety or symbolic capital), the art market (economic capital) and the networks (social capital) is becoming more complex. The internationalization of art is based on both the international network of cultural institutions (museums, biennals, etc.) and the international network of galleries and auction houses (Christie's and Sotheby's, international fairs). In our paper, we will analyze the development and function of the international fairs during the last twenty-five years, and we will study more specifically the ""strategies of internationalization"" of American, Canadian and French contemporary art galleries, and their participation to international art fairs."
0	Labor economic literature has demonstrated a consistent positive association between immigrants earnings and their level of proficiency in the host societys language. Sociological literature, on the other hand, has explicated that immigrants abilities to speak the host societys language are affected by structural/ecological factors which shape the linguistic environment of immigrants. This study proposes a logical extension of the two literatures by suggesting that structural /ecological factors affect immigrants earnings indirectly by affecting their ability to speak the host societys language. Using individual and aggregate data from the U.S. Census 2000, we found that structural/ecological factors such as group size, segregation, and linguistic heterogeneity affected immigrants earnings not only directly but also indirectly via their impacts on immigrants English ability. English ability is a key mediator through which structural forces shape individual immigrants economic assimilation outcome.
0	The paper presents the development and the political orientations of both European employment policy and its French counterpart. In particular, the examples of Emploi Jeune and the 35-hour work week will be used to illustrate the relationship between national and European policy. It would be inaccurate to conceive of the European Employment Policy as a concrete set of laws. The guidelines are so broad, that they permit a wide range of employment policies. This is due to the fact that the European Employment Policy was the result of lengthy debates between countries with different political orientations and is, at its base, a compromise. Thus the European Employment Policy has the greatest effect on a symbolic level by imposing its categories and terms upon Member States. Much like European economic policy in general, it determines the legitimate form of intervention in the labor market, which is today heavily influenced by liberal economic ideology.
0	During the nineteenth century, the execution of women emerged as a site fraught with social and political tension. The newspapers wrote incessantly about such executions, reform societies worked hard to save women from the gallows, and legislatures occasionally intervened to save a particular woman from execution. And yet, there has never been a movement organized specifically around the goal of saving women from the gallows. Hence, the protest campaigns against the execution of particular women were ad hoc movements, comprised of a multitude of groups, organizations, and various interested individuals who entered the protest fray from all different kinds of positions, and were guided by a wide range of concerns and interests. This does not mean, however, that these campaigns were devoid of organized movements; on the contrary, what generated and fueled the controversy over female executions were the efforts of two major reform movements at the time: the anti-gallows movement and the movement for womens rights. In this paper I show, first, how the efforts of these two social movements, sometimes separately, sometimes jointly, contributed to turning the execution of women into a problematic state activity, mired in conflict, sensationalism, and embarrassment. It would be a mistake, however, to consider this outcome an unambiguous advantage for either or both of the movements. Instead, and secondly, the analysis shows how the movements at times ended up undermining each other's reform goals. Analytically, this paper suggests that we need to extend our foci beyond the relationships movements have with targets, adherents, and/or opponents, to also include the occasions that bring movements together and that impact the kinds of relationships that movements can and do have with each other.
0	Based on ethnographic research of the lives of Japanese expatriate mothers and children in Los Angeles, this study uncovers a way of being transnational that has not been studied fully in the literatures on assimilation and transnationalism. Deeply concerned about the childrens reintegration into Japans competitive educational system, the mothers and children develop mental transnationalism, which I define as imagining, planning, and strategizing a return home trajectory based on bicultural knowledge. This study examines how the mothers maintain and enact mental transnationalism to facilitate their childrens acquisition of bilingual and bicultural skills that are beneficial to both their adaptation to the present American educational context and the Japanese educational context to which they return in the future. It finds that embeddedness in a resourceful transnational social field, part of which is composed of institutionalized preparation rituals during the pre-departure period and a well-established Japanese community in Los Angeles are the crucial factors sustaining mental transnationalism. It also finds that child-rearing based on mental transnationalism requires mothers intensive labor, which contributes to childrens successful return home yet takes its toll on mothers emotion.
1	"Received wisdom, some sociological theory and a handful of qualitative studies suggest that the ""night shift"" of caregiving work that interrupts sleep is a burden borne disproportionately by women. However, there is no broadly representative evidence to substantiate claims about who takes the night shift in contemporary American households. Analyses using data from the nationally-representative 2003-2007 American Time Use Surveys show that net of age, paid work commitment, partnership status and the presence and age of dependents, working mothers were significantly and substantially more likely to get up for the night shift than working fathers. These results suggest that the sleeping hours, which make up a third of every day, are an understudied but important site for micro-level processes that reflect and reproduce gender stratification."
1	Bullying is an important social problem that occurs within a bounded social setting. As such, it is best understood by analyzing the social dynamics that produce and sustain it. However, previous research has tended to view bullying as a manifestation of personal pathology or amorphous characteristics of contexts. The present study addresses this gap in the literature by applying the construct of collective efficacy to account for variations in the frequency of bullying perpetration within schools. Just as collective efficacy provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the dynamics of bullying in schools, these settings also provide an ideal social context for testing collective efficacy theory. The reason is that schools are clearly defined contexts with regular, ongoing social interactions among students, teachers, school staff and administrators. In the present study, both lagged cross-sectional (LCS) models and fall-to-spring change (FSC) models were estimated to determine the empirical relations between student perceptions of collective efficacy and bullying perpetration, using data collected from 7,299 youth in fifth, eighth, and eleventh grades in 78 schools. Two key results were found: (1) perceptions of collective efficacy were negatively, significantly, and substantially associated with the frequency of bullying perpetration within schools over time, and (2) of the three components of collective efficacy (cohesion and trust, informal social control by adults, informal social control by peers) identified in a principal components factor analysis, cohesion and trust had the strongest estimated effects in all models estimated. Findings suggest that collective efficacy theory can provide a useful framework for capturing important dynamics of bullying in schools with important implications for prevention and intervention.
0	One of the most dramatic social transformations of the latter half of the twentieth century involved the massive influx of women into the paid labor force.  The large scale movement of women into wage labor after World War II has occurred in every OECD country, although the rate of growth in women's entry into the labor force and rates of female employment vary substantially across nations. In this paper we examine women's employment in 18 OECD countries between 1974 and 1999.   We analyze social survey data from a large number of countries using multilevel modeling methods.  We examine labor force participation within countries along demographic and economic lines, and we investigate how the relationship between female employment and the structural features of labor markets depend on the institutional context by incorporating specific information about institutional arrangements over-time and across countries.  This research provides a comprehensive analysis of both structural and institutional arguments for women's involvement in the paid labor force and helps clarify our understanding of cross-national variation in measures of gender equity at the close of the century.
1	We examine the relational model of inequality using samples of employer-employee matched data from manufacturing plants in the United States and Japan. We argue that gender is a salient status characteristic in both the United States and Japan, but because of differences in gender politics, wage inequality will vary more across U.S. workplaces than Japanese workplaces. We find this claim to be supported, and then we model this variation as a function of exploitation and opportunity hoarding processes. Women's exclusion from high-wage plants and gender-linked claims-making resources help to explain between and within plant wage variation in U.S. workplaces. In Japan, where gender distinctions were less locally contested, access to lifetime employment and gender differences in labor supply generate local gender wage gaps. This paper provides evidence on the utility of relational inequality theory and an empirical strategy to observe the exploitation and opportunity hoarding mechanisms.
1	"To mobilize support for war and to control dissent, governments draw upon deeply engrained discourses regarding soldiering and the citizen's duty to support the troops. We identify the cultural and political evolution of the discursive legacy of ""support the troops"" from the Vietnam War through the Iraq War. Using longitudinal and comparative organizational analyses, we analyze how this discursive legacy was engaged by U. S. peace movement organizations (PMOs)."
0	"In this paper we explore a cultural divide between sociology's study of professions during the 1970s and 1980s and the subsequent rise of a professionalism movement within organized medicine -- the latter somewhat ironically taking place just as sociology's analytic interest in medicine's professionalism prospects began to wain.  In turn, sociology appears to be equally disinterested in medicine's current (and ongoing) efforts to reestablish its professionalism credentials.  It is as if two ships have passed in the night -- twice over.    To explore these two waves of inattention, we briefly review the rise of a sociology of professions, with a particular focus on the ""great debate"" of the 1970s and early 1980s between Eliot Freidson and his critics.  Next, we more fully  explore the subsequent rise of a professionalism movement within organized medicine -- largely because its evolution has taken place largely outside of sociological scrutiny.    Here, we take particular interest in the relative (and longstanding) absence of a sociological perspective within medicine's emerging discourse on professionalism, and how recent twists in this discourse may well signal a shift within medicine from an almost exclusive focus on motives (e.g., the call to physicians to rediscover their professional roots) to the recognition of how various structural conditions facing professions, including public policy, payment structures, and different organizational forms may hinder or facilitate agency --thereby offering sociology a strategic seat at the head of the analytic table.    How sociology might respond to this challenge rounds out the remainder of our discussion."
1	This study examines the extent to which geographic variation in Food Stamp Program (FSP) participation is explained by place-based factors, with special attention to the case of the three poorest regions of the United States: Central Appalachia, the Texas Borderland, and the Lower Mississippi Delta. We use descriptive statistics and regression models to assess the prevalence and correlates of county-level FSP participation circa 2005. Our findings show that the economic distress that has long characterized Appalachia, the Borderland, and the Delta clearly translates into greater reliance on the FSP relative to other areas of the country. State-level effects and local-level variations in poverty, labor market conditions, population structure, human capital, and residential context explain much of this reality. Yet, even after taking all of these factors into account, these regional geographies remain home to particularly high FSP participation. Our findings underscore the importance of considering these regions as key cases of study in the stratification of American society and hold a variety of implications for public policy. 
1	Using insights from ethnographic studies of conservative Protestant congregations, the authors propose and test a refined conceptual model of theological conservatism that accounts for three key components of a theologically conservative worldview: (1. epistemology, a belief in the Bible as the inspired word of God, (2. ontology, assumptions about the pervasiveness of human sinfulness, and (3. soteriology, the conviction that salvation is made possible through a commitment to Jesus Christ. Structural equation modeling is used to examine the reliability and validity of this model across data sets and relativity to current approaches used in the study of religion. The proposed measure exhibits a substantial improvement for defining and interpreting the influence of religious conservatism across and within sociodemographic groups in contemporary American society.
0	This paper is part of a dissertation that explores how the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly called Mormons, managed changes in key religious beliefs and practices across their history.  This paper demonstrates how the church managed the sudden death of their founder and economic, social, political, legal, and military leader, the charismatic Joseph Smith, in the absence of any plan for succession and in the context of immense contestation from within and attacks from without.  I argue that Brigham Young was able to gain control of most of the church during this period via a strategy that combined the cultural schema of divine revelation with the material resources of power in the church in a way that produced a new enduring social structure, routinized charisma that remained charismatic.
1	A striking feature of modern societies is the extent to which individual persons are culturally validated as equal and empowered actors. The expansion of a wide range of rights in recent decades, given prominence in current discussions of world society, supports an expanded conception of the individual. We examine the extent to which broad global changes promoting human empowerment are associated with expanded ideas of the status and capacities of students. We hypothesize that there are substantial increases in student-centered educational foci in countries around the world. First, the rights of students as children are directly asserted. Second, an emphasis on empowered human agency supports forms of socialization that promote active participation as well as the capacities and interests of the student. Examining a unique dataset of 533 secondary school social science textbooks from 74 countries published over the past 40 years, we find that textbooks have indeed become more student-centered, and that this shift is associated with the rising status of individuals and children in global human rights treaties and organizations. Student-centered texts are more common in countries with greater individualism embodied in political and socio-economic institutions and ideologies, and with more links to world society. The study contributes to both political and educational sociology, examining how global changes lead to increased emphasis on empowered individual agency in intended curricula.
0	Using server logs from a weblogging system we document patterns in how people contribute, how and with whom they interact, and how long they stick around.  For each participant we study the various ways they participate in the site and their position in local social networks created by social actions like invitation, comment, and association. We find builders who consistently modify their own blogs but seldom make comments or visibly interact, connectors who direct most of their energy to commenting or other visible communications, and lurkers who log in consistently yet seldom make new additions to their own blog or visibly interact with others.  We describe these three types of users, document their prevalence in a Weblogging system, and study how their network position during their first month of participation shapes role they take and how long they stick around.
1	Emotions are essential but little understood components of research; they catalyze and sustain creative scientific work and fuel the scientific and intellectual social movements (SIMs) that propel scientific change. Adopting a micro-sociological focus, we examine how emotions shape two intellectual processes central to all scientific work: conceiving creative ideas and managing skepticism. We illustrate these processes through a longitudinal study of the Resilience Alliance, a tightly networked coherent group collaborating at the center of a burgeoning scientific social movement in the environmental sciences. We show how emotions structured and were structured by the group's growth and development, and how socio-emotive processes facilitated the rapid production of highly creative science and helped overcome skepticism by outsiders. Hot spots and hot moments-that is, brief but intense periods of collaboration undertaken in remote and isolated settings-fueled the group's scientific performance and drove the SIM. Paradoxically, however, the same socio-emotive processes that ignited and sustained creative scientific research also made skepticism more likely to occur and more difficult to manage. Similarly, emotions and social bonding were essential for the group's growth and development, but increased size and diversity have the potential to erode the affective culture that generated initial successes.
0	Current college enrollments are at all time highs, yet inequality in educational attainment and obstacles to social mobility persist.  This paper uses the 2002 Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) to examine how college admissions preparations, as well as the knowledge for navigating the education system that comes with cultural capital, serve to create a “competitive edge” in the college admissions process and impact college destinations.  I focus on inequalities in the selectivity of the college or university one attends.  Using multinomial logistic regressions, I find that attendance at a highly selective four-year college or university increases with cultural capital and college admissions preparations and increases in college preparation increase the selectivity of that college.  These results support the effectively maintained inequality (EMI) hypothesis.  The implications for sociology of education and theories of educational access are discussed.
1	Despite dramatic changes in education and occupational opportunities for Blacks in the United States, facilitated by affirmative action policies, the White-Black earnings' gap has not vanished. Although the literature on this issue has become substantial no one has yet provided a systematic examination of changes in the earnings' gap that takes into consideration the concomitant changes in the occupational structure and changes in the racial composition of occupational labor markets as well as changes in characteristics of the labor force. In the present research, we use 5 waves of IPUMS data and hierarchical linear modeling to estimate changes in the effect of race on earnings between 1960 and 2000. The models focus on the interaction of time and race with earnings while controlling for individual-level characteristics (i.e. education) at the individual-level and the characteristics of detailed occupational labor markets (i.e. occupational socioeconomic status, race and gender composition, occupational earnings inequality) at the aggregate level. In order to evaluate the effect of change over time, both linear and non-linear trends in earning gaps are estimated in the labor market as a whole and separately for the public and private sectors. The data reveal that net of changes in the occupational distributions and market-relevant characteristics of Black and White men, the gaps have generally narrowed but at a declining rate. The data also reveal considerable differences in racial earnings inequality between the public and the private sectors. Whereas the unexplained earnings gap in the public sector has virtually vanished by 2000, in the private sector, the gap is still significant, although it declined over time. The findings are discussed in light of past research in order to re-evaluate the contribution of labor market attributes and sector differences to change in earnings disparities between Black and White men in the US. 
0	This article explores the processes involved in the collective valorization of the FDNY following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  The analysis suggests that medias framing of the firefighters, coupled with the support of key political and cultural elites, created a context that was extremely supportive of the notion of firefighters as heroes and moral exemplars, which, in turn, substantially advanced the firefighters status and prestige.  This exalted status served as a symbolic commodity that the firefighters were able to leverage to great effect within the response and recovery operation at the World Trade Center site and in a variety of other political and social realms.
0	Building on structuralist perspectives of the world economy, a few authors  have expanded the idea of unequal exchange into the area of the unequal distribution of both goods and bads between the worlds rich and poor nations.  The ideas have been verified by a few dedicated researchers documenting that energy and materials disproportionately flow from the global South to the North.  Since extraction of resources and energy are some of the most damaging stages of the chain of commodity production, a logical next step is the mounting cry from the South that they are owed an ecological debt by the North.  The idea has gained wide approval, in part for negotiating reasons for the highly indebted countries and the G77.  Now a  movement for climate justice has spread and is gaining weight in international negotiating for a such as the UNFCCC meetings in Delhi and Bali.  This paper reviews some of the history of these three ideas, and discusses their potential to reshape the discussion of burden sharing in the post-Kyoto world where development is constrained by climate change.
1	Consistent with the hypothesis that heightened visibility and competition lead to greater economic discrimination against minorities, countless studies have observed a negative association between minority population concentration and minority socioeconomic attainment. But minorities who reside in areas with high minority concentration are likely to differ from minorities who reside in areas with few minorities on unobserved characteristics related to economic attainment. Thus, this association may be a product of differential skills, behaviors and networks acquired during childhood or of selective migration. Applying fixed-effects models to a quarter century of panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we find that for Blacks and Latinos the inverse association between minority population concentration and earnings is eliminated when unobserved person-specific characteristics are controlled. The findings suggest that the negative association between Black population size and Blacks' earnings is driven largely by the selection of high-earning Blacks into labor markets with relatively small Black populations. Most of the association between Latino population concentration and earnings is attributable to the level of Latino population concentration experienced during childhood.
1	This paper investigates Mexican immigrant incorporation by examining labor force participation and schooling among Mexican-origin adolescents in the United States. Theoretical perspectives on immigrant incorporation, labor migration-related cultural repertoires and adolescent development considered together imply that studying ethnoracial differences in schooling among adolescents without taking work into account can yield mis-leading pictures of Mexican-origin non-high school completion patterns, thus hampering the assessment of incorporation theories. To avoid this, we analyze Mexican-origin generational differences in the relationship between schooling and workforce participation among adolescents compared to non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Using micro-data from the 2000 US Census, we find that Mexican immigrant boys who are not enrolled in school are more likely to be in the workforce, and conversely that those who are enrolled in school are much less likely to be in the workforce, compared to whites and blacks. Such relative differences in school/work specialization, as predicted, diminish across Mexican-origin generations. Moreover, based on supplementary analyses, we find similar patterns for a cohort of young adults who failed to complete high school during the 1990s. Overall, the results are consistent with the idea that cultural orientations growing out of the nature and experience of Mexican labor migration are important for assessing school enrollment patterns among Mexican-origin youth and for gauging their implications for educational policy and immigrant-group incorporation.

0	Few studies have empirically examined the perceived ages at which various life stages begin or end. The existing literature is limited by its focus on old age and neglect of middle age, as well as by inadequate attention to factors beyond chronological age and gender in shaping perceptions of the timing of life stages. Using one wave of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS; 1995-1996), this study explores how two sets of factors, locations in systems of inequality and family relationships, shape the perceived ages at which middle age begins and ends. This analysis indicate that perceptions of the timing middle age are shaped, in part by age, gender, race and socioeconomic status, as well as various family roles (e.g. parenthood and having an adult child), and the timing of family-related transitions like early marriage and parenthood. However, the effects of these factors vary by perceptions of women’s and men’s timing of middle age, as well as by perceptions of the timing of the beginning and end of middle age, suggesting further research into the significance the beginning and ending of middle age holds for women and men.
1	"Why does the adherence to norms not prevent conflict? While the current literature focuses on the emergence, maintenance and impact of norms with regard to cooperation, the issue of norm-related conflict deserves more attention. We develop a general game theoretical model of ""normative conflict"" and explain how transaction failures on the macrolevel can result from cooperative motives on the microlevel. We differentiate between two kinds of conflict. The first results from distinct expectations regarding the way in which general normative obligations should be fulfilled, the second from distinct expectations as to how the norm should restrain actions based on self-interest. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of normative conflict in a version of the ultimatum game. Our data reveal widespread normative conflict among different types of actors - egoistic, equity, equality and cherry picker. Our findings demonstrate how cooperative intentions about how to divide a collectively produced good may fail to produce cooperative outcomes."
1	In this article, the continuity in music taste from parents to their children is discussed via a multi-actor design. In our models music preferences of 325 adolescents and both their parents were linked, with parental and adolescent educational level as covariates. Parents' preferences for different types of music that had been popular when they were young were subsumed under the general labels of Pop, Rock and Highbrow. Current adolescent music preferences resolved into Pop, Rock, Highbrow and Dance. Among partners in a couple, tastes were similar; for both generations, education was linked to taste; and parental preferences predicted adolescent music choices. More specifically, the preference of fathers and mothers for Pop was associated with adolescent preferences for Pop and Dance. Parents' preferences for Rock seemed to indicate their daughters would also like Rock music, but not their sons. Parental passion for Highbrow music was associated with Highbrow preferences among their children. It is concluded that preferences for cultural artifacts such as (popular) music show continuity from generation to generation.
0	In light of recent proposals to reform US immigration law, it is particularly important to understand how immigrants receive and respond to legal information.  This paper uses a 1996 change to the US Immigration and Nationality Act, which streamlined deportation procedures and raised the burden long-term undocumented residents must meet to avoid being removed from the United States, as a window on the processes of information-sharing and decision-making that shape the impact of immigration laws.  To understand who this particular legal change affected and how, it examines deportation proceedings from an ethnographic perspective, addressing two questions.  First, how did long-time US residents currently in deportation proceedings get there in the first place, and what does this have to do with the way in which they understood their legal rights?  Second, what happens when people encounter state bureaucracy?  The ethnography first uncovers a number of factors which have created a disjuncture between immigrants everyday interpretations of the law and those made by legal professionals.  It then describes the way in which decisions on deportation cases are made in court and the processes and resources that shape those decisions.
0	The Cleveland Cultural Gardens, part of Rockefeller Park in the heart of Cleveland, Ohio, are a contiguous (1.5 mile long) chain of landscaped gardens, many including elaborate stonework and sculpture, each of which represents an ethnic or minority community  most of them European nationality groups. The Gardens continue to exist, albeit in a very different cultural and demographic environment than initially conceived; the surrounding urban neighborhoods were transformed from almost exclusively white to almost exclusively African-American. In this paper I briefly describe and trace the history of the Gardens since their inception in 1926. I then focus on the how the Gardens were part of the impression management, construction, and maintenance of four identities: (1) immigrant-ethnics - as loyal Americans; (2) Americans - as loyal ethnics; (3) Clevelanders - as cosmopolitan role models for the nation and the world; and (4) Whites -- as not Blacks. While data have been collected for the entire history of the Gardens from 1926 to 2001, for this paper the data on identities is drawn mostly -- though by no means exclusively -- from the 1930's.
1	Research shows that peer status in adolescence is positively associated with school achievement and adjustment. However, subculture theories of juvenile delinquency and school-based ethnographies suggest that (I. disadvantaged boys are often able to gain some forms of peer status through violence and (2. membership in violent groups undermines educational attainment. Building on these ideas, we use peer network data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine whether peer status within highly violent groups increases male risks of high school dropout. Consistent with the subcultural argument, we find that disadvantaged boys with high status in violent groups are at much greater risks of high school dropout than other students.
1	In the context of rapidly expanding postsecondary enrollments, community colleges have the potential to play a critical and often overlooked role as a postsecondary safety net for initial four-year students who are ill prepared to successfully complete or finance their college educations. A growing proportion of the population served by community colleges engages in reverse transfer: they begin their college careers in a four-year institution but transfer to a community college prior to earning a degree. We use the National Education Longitudinal Study to examine the causes and consequences of reverse transfer for students who were expected to complete high school in 1992. Using propensity scores to control for selection into a community college, we find that the safety net function of community colleges is especially important for disadvantaged students who are significantly more likely to transfer down or drop out of higher education entirely without completing a bachelor's degree. Although reverse transfers do not fare as well as students with exclusive four-year college enrollment, they have more favorable academic and labor market outcomes than otherwise similar students who drop out of postsecondary school altogether. Community colleges may therefore lower the cost of dropping out of a four-year college.
1	Using data from the US Current Population Surveys 2006-2008, I examine the weekly work hours of Mexican immigrants. Mexican immigrant workers on average work 2-4 h less than non-Hispanic whites per week, which contradicts the popular portrait of long immigrant work hours. Four mechanisms to explain this gap are proposed and examined. Results show that the work time disparity between non-Hispanic white and Mexican immigrant workers is explained by differences in human capital, ethnic concentration in the labor market, and selection process into employment. English proficiency has limited effect on work time after location in labor market is specified, while the effect of citizenship status remains robust. 
0	As certified organic agriculture extends its global reach, in some regions such as the European Union, supportive agri-environmental policies aim to encourage the adoption of this production method through favorable subsidy structures under the rubric of “multifunctional agriculture.”  What is the impact of these favorable incentive-based subsidies in rural communities? In this narrative paper—based on extensive field research, including over 100 in-depth interviews with certified organic farmers in Poland in 2006—I describe ways in which certain EU agri-environmental policies—in this case multifunctional mechanisms designed to protect certified organic land in Poland—are creating perverse incentives there, inadvertently leading to policy contradictions and generating tensions in the organic sector. I suggest ways that these perverse incentives arise in part due to a failure of policy mechanisms to address local social and cultural complexity, including divergent visions of land and land histories. As a result, I argue that perverse incentives reflect a failure to clearly articulate the EU’s vision of multifunctional organic landscapes in a way that is meaningful to many now joining the sector.
1	Environmental issues continue to grow in international prominence, as environmental conditions are recognized as some of the most important problems facing the world. Research examining this globalization of environmental concern shown in public opinion surveys emphasizes the importance of context yet is currently underspecified. To address this gap, this research uses a multi-level, cross-national study to examine individual-level and country-level influences on three measures of environmental concern: environmental threat awareness, environmental efficacy, and willingness to pay. At the individual level, education, age, and gender affect environmental concerns. At the national level, economic, political, and environmental factors affect environmental concerns. Importantly, contextual factors differ in their effects depending on the dimension of environmental concern measured. Results from cross-level interactions for education confirm these complexities across these measures, supporting a dimensionality argument. The importance of the measurement of environmental concern shown in this research is emphasized for future cross-national scholarship. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	Both advocacy for and critiques of the Human Genome Project assume a self-sustaining relationship between genetics and medicalization. However, this assumption ignores the ways in which the meanings of genetic research are conditional on its position in sequences of events. Based on analyses of three conditions for which at least one putative gene or genetic marker has been identified, this article argues that critical junctures in the institutional stabilization of phenotypes and the mechanisms that sustain such classifications over time configure the practices and meanings of genetic research. Path dependence is critical to understanding the lack of consistent fit between genetics and medicalization.
1	Two literatures on work and the labor market draw attention to the importance of non-pecuniary job amenities. Social psychological perspectives on work suggest that workers have preferences for a range of job amenities (e.g. Halaby, 2003). The compensating differentials hypothesis predicts that workers navigate tradeoffs among different job amenities such that wage inequality overstates inequality in utility (Smith, 1979). This paper joins these perspectives by constructing a new measure of labor market success that evaluates the degree to which workers' job amenity preferences and outcomes match. This measure of subjective success is used to predict workers' job satisfaction and to test the hypothesis that some degree of labor force inequality in wages is due to preference-based tradeoffs among all job amenities. Findings demonstrate that the new measure predicts workers' job satisfaction and provides evidence for the presence of compensating differentials in the primary and intermediate, but not secondary, labor markets.

0	This paper presents first-hand evidence of organizational reform in a union local of service workers. I combine participant observation and interviews to study the nature and consequences of reform, and pay special attention to union representatives responses to changes in grievance-handling work. I focus on union representatives views about three dimensions of change: the ideology of union work, the role of formality in relations with employers and union members, and strategies to best represent workers from different national and ethnic groups. My findings contribute to the literature on union renewal by focusing on a union local currently undergoing large-scale reforms to streamline and transform the nature of representation work. Examining these changes and recording the views of different actors involved provides an opportunity to look at an actual alternative to the business model, what contradictions it left behind, and what new tensions have emerged in their place.
0	Regular attendance at religious services has been tied to many positive life characteristics, one of which is lower likelihood of mortality in later life.  While many studies examine the effect of service attendance on correlates of mortality such as social ties, health status, and health behaviors, very few studies evaluate the effect on mortality itself.  Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study 1993 and 2004 graduate surveys, I test the effect of attendance at religious services on mortality in several comprehensive models.  Even when measures of demographics, socioeconomic status, health status, health behaviors, access to health insurance, and social ties are included, weekly service attendance still predicts a 33 percent lower odds ratio of mortality over the 11 year period.  My findings loosely corroborate the results of other studies concerning the effects of the explanatory variables.  While these results do lend understanding to important correlates of mortality, still missing is an explanation for the effect of religious attendance on later life mortality.  Regardless, service attendance does play a strong role in reducing the likelihood of later life mortality.
0	This article has focused on the corporate social giving as an organizational behavior which is not fully explained in terms of the organizational goal of corporations, maximizing their economic profitability. This study reviews previous articles which have concerns in the corporate social responsibility and then point out their weakness, economic-biased explanations caused from paying attention only to the economic consequences of the corporate social giving. Therefore this article tries to give more convincing explanation reflecting social context on why corporate participate in a uneconomic activities, especially in the case of Korean listed corporation. This study makes three different analysis frames, shareholder model perspective, stakeholder model perspective and institutional perspective and tests the arguments empirically. As the result, corporate social giving has no statistically significant relation with economic profitability itself and intra-organizational morality. Otherwise, they have strong relations with institutional circumstance such as the professional or public opinion in amity with the corporate philanthropic activities. In other word, explaining corporate philanthropic giving in terms of profitability or organizational ethics can not be supported statistically. Even if, it is alleged with the economic or ethical reasons, increasing corporate social giving rate reflect the institutional pressures around them not the economic or moral sequences.
0	A major problem for the newly emerging countries of the former Soviet Union has been the development of democracy and the shaping of new social values.  I want to explore, in this sketch of my research, some pre-political conditions of a sense of the connections between civil society and authority. The research uses a dramatic film to initiate discussions of issues concerning democracy, nationalism, and civil values.  The film will be shown four times in the US, and four times in Baku, Azerbaijan, for a total of eight recordings of focused discussion.  The American part of the research has been done.  I have already completed the four American ethnographic observations and focus groups in the U.S., and have transcribed and coded the data.  The Azeri part of the research will begin in February 2003 by administering the four focus groups and coding them. In addition, I will have prepared the American data for discussion. In summary, this study is intended to shed light on Azeri attitudes towards the USA and its cultural products, to explore Azeri attitudes towards a number of key issues connected with the relationship between democratic authority and the sense of civil society, and to further understanding of the formation of a new nation.
1	This study estimates the effects of prenatal poverty on birth weight using changes in state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) as a natural experiment. We seek to answer two questions about poverty and child wellbeing. First, are there associations between prenatal poverty and lower birth weights even after factoring out unmeasured potential confounders? Because birth weight predicts a range of outcomes across the life course, lower birth weights that result from poverty may have lasting consequences for children's life chances. Second, how have recent expansions of a work-based welfare program (i.e., the EITC) affected maternal and infant health? In recent decades, U. S. poverty relief has become increasingly tied to earnings and labor markets, but the consequences for children's wellbeing remain controversial. We find that state EITCs increase birth weights and reduce maternal smoking. However, results related to AFDC/TANF and varying EITC effects across maternal ages raise cautionary messages.
0	"This paper is based upon an ethnographic study of the Israeli-Palestinian subsidiary of a large transnational corporation (TNC) in the high-tech industry. Critiquing the tendency of globalization theorists to conceptualize TNCs solely in terms of their impact on their external environment, this paper looks inward and examines the ideological and practical constituents of the transnational regime of consciousness as expressed through what management titles ""The one company approach."" It argues, that this regime lays foundations for a global form of an ""imagined community"" which does not rival the national one, but in fact internalizes it in a way that creates a new arena of discretionary power for managers: deciding when to activate and when to suppress nationality as a means for enhancing profit and securing home-base hegemony in the transnational organizational universe. This study's unique contextual vantage point helps highlight this complex interrelationship between transnationalism and nationalism inside the organization, the power dynamics at play, and the implications of all this for understanding the role and significance of TNCs for globalization."
0	Past efforts to conceptualize the mental health of African American women have applied traditional mental health models a priori to this and other minority groups; often leading to inconsistent and inconclusive findings related to mental health components and processes. Such research has mainly focused on defining and testing for mental health using an objective set of measures and conceptual definitions of mental health that have failed to consider both structural and individual variables, as well as mental health processes that directly influence mental health. In-depth interviews with 20 African American women identified as having mental health in three U.S. metropolitan cities show that mental health is an active pursuit that is supported through the use of a deconstructive/reconstructive process, in addition to other coping mechanisms. Deconstruction is an interpretive process that involves recognizing and externalizing factors affecting ones mental health and is shaped by ones relative position to her social environment. Participants use the deconstructive process to identify four early childhood socialization practices and three factors shaping their adulthood that negatively impact their mental functioning. I argue that deconstruction alone is insufficient to maintaining a healthy state of mind. Reconstruction, or the ability to transform potential mental health threats into effective counterstrategies is a significant mental health process; this research discusses four counterstrategies used by participants. Reconstruction strategies depend on ones race, gender, sexuality, religious beliefs/practices, mothering and marital status, age and available coping resources.
0	Drawing on the journal writings and newspaper accounts of the 1830s press, this paper argues that the Anglo-American abolitionist movements provide a case study of the spread of tactics from Great Britain to the United States, with limited adaptation of these diffused tactics on the part of American abolitionists. Tactics included petitioning legislative bodies, public meetings, public journal writing, and the formation of public organizations.  I argue that the case study provides evidence to expand Tilly’s concept of repertoire by building on Tilly’s unfinished discussion of repertoire strength and regime type. While Tilly discussed at length the conditions for the creation of a “strong repertoire,” the case of Anglo-American abolitionism provides evidence of a “weak repertoire,” a dimension within Tilly’s concept of repertoire left unexplored. Regime conditions of political repression prevented tactical adaptation by activists, thereby leading to a “weakened repertoire” of tactics characterized by limited British influence and internal confusion, where little was agreed upon among American abolitionists.
1	"This paper employs data from a recent national survey to offer an empirical assessment of core theoretical tenets of whiteness studies. Using survey items developed explicitly for this purpose, we analyze three specific propositions relating to whites' awareness and conception of their own racial status: the invisibility of white identity; the understanding (or lack thereof) of racial privileges; and adherence to individualistic, color-blind ideals. Consistent with whiteness theories, we find that white Americans are less aware of privilege than individuals from racial minority groups and consistently adopt color-blind, individualist ideologies. However, we also find that whites are both more connected to white identity and culture as well as more aware of the advantages of their race than many theoretical discussions suggest. We then combine these results to estimate that 15 percent of white Americans exhibit what we call ""categorical whiteness,"" a consistent and uniform adherence to the theoretical tenets that are the focus of this body of theory. We conclude by suggesting that these findings provide the basis for a more nuanced, contextualized understanding of whiteness as a social phenomenon."
0	"In this paper I present early findings from an on-going qualitative research project designed to explore how ""at-risk"" girls enrolled in a city hospital-based violence intervention project use and experience violence.  Specifically, I use participant observation and in-depth interviews with project participants to explore girls' experience with violence while considering the following questions: 1) What is the context of girls' use of violence? 2) What is the nature of girls' pathways to violence? For example, how does past victimization influence the future use of violence or future victimization? and 3) How do intersections of race, gender and class structure thinkable courses of actions and identities related to girls' use of and experience with violence?"
1	Modernization theory argues that, as societies industrialize and further develop, the influence of social background and other ascribed characteristics on educational and socioeconomic Outcomes declines, while achievement in the education system becomes more important. The purpose of this research is to investigate propositions derived from modernization theory as they apply to Australian society during the second half of the 2 0,h century. Specifically, these are (1. declines in the influence of socioeconomic background on education, occupation and earnings; (2. increases in the occupational and economic returns to education; and (3. decreases in gender inequalities in all three outcomes. These propositions are examined using data from nationally representative surveys conducted from 1965 through 2005. In accordance with modernization theory, it was found that the effects of socioeconomic background on education, occupational attainment and earnings have declined. Gender inequalities in education have been reversed, and the gender gap in earnings has declined. The effect of education on occupational attainment has increased more strongly among men than women. Contrary to expectations from one interpretation of modernization theory, the returns in earnings from education have not increased.
1	This study proposes a theoretical framework to understand how nations deal with collective memories of perpetration of severe human rights violations, which do not fit comfortably in any national master narrative but have become increasingly difficult to ignore. Building on studies of collective memory, the framework explicates how initial historical conditions of the nation, domestic social movements, and the degree of international pressures move the national discourse along two key dimensions-(1. acceptance of guilt and (2. international orientation of the discourse-which map out seven possible responses to collective trauma of perpetration. Through examination of the history of post-war Japan and content analyses of newspaper editorials and prime ministers' speeches from 1945 through 2004, the empirical analysis applies the framework to the Japanese case. The analysis reveals that arguments for apologies to Asian victims have gained ground due to the intensification of domestic social movements, international pressures from neighboring countries, and global human rights influence. It also shows that arguments that evade the ugly past have persisted because of the initial conditions immediately after 1945, overwhelming emphasis on Japanese victims in the ensuing decades, and recent appropriation of human rights language by proponents of the defensive arguments.
1	Emergent economies suffer from underdeveloped market infrastructures and insufficient public institutions to enforce contract commitments and property rights. Informal reputation-based arrangements may substitute for government enforcement, but they require close-knit networks that enable monitoring. Economic development also requires access to capital, information, and other resources, which is enabled by wide-reaching and diverse networks and not by closure. How is entrepreneurship possible given these conflicting demands? In this article, the authors examine how partnership networks and reputation channel the mobilization of capital for new enterprises, using quantitative information on 4,172 corporate partnerships during the industrialization of late imperial Russia (1869-1913). They find that reputation is locally effective in small and homogeneous network components. By contrast, founders in the largest components that form the network core raise more capital from investors but benefit less from reputation and more from brokerage opportunities and ties that reach diverse communities.
1	Despite a plethora of studies, we do not know why autism incidence has increased rapidly over the past two decades. Using California data, this study shows that children living very close to a child previously diagnosed with autism are more likely to be diagnosed with autism. An underlying social influence mechanism involving information diffusion drives this result, contributing to 16% of the increase in prevalence over 2000-2005. We eliminate competing explanations (i.e., residential sorting, environmental toxicants, and viral transmission) through seven tests and show that information diffusion simultaneously contributed to the increased prevalence, spatial clustering, and decreasing age of diagnosis.
0	How relevant are the available theoretical perspectives on marriage dissolution to modern family forms? By employing a unique longitudinal register-based data for the Jewish population in Israel, this study examines which of the major theoretical perspectives on economic determinants of divorce better explains transition to divorce among dual-earner couples. Our findings show strong support for most of the seemingly contradictory theories. Contrary to the women's economic independence hypothesis, the wife’s earnings do not affect divorce risk. In line with theories of income pooling, higher shared salaries increase marital stability. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that the basic assumption of symmetry between the spouses in these theories does not hold. Although both spouses’ employment stability reduce divorce risk, only the husband’s salary negatively affects the odds of divorce and only the wife’s working hours negatively affect marriage stability. Therefore, a new theoretical synthesis is required to explain the economics of current families.
1	"Current debates over identity politics hinge on the question of whether status-based social movements encourage parochialism and self-interest or create possibilities for mutual recognition across lines of difference. Our article explores this question through comparative, ethnographic study of two racially progressive social movements, ""pro-black"" abolitionism and ""conscious"" hip hop. We argue that status-based social movements not only enable collective identity, but also the personal identities or selves of their participants. Beliefs about the self create openings and obstacles to mutual recognition and progressive social action. Our analysis centers on the challenges that an influx of progressive, anti-racist whites posed to each movement. We examine first how each movement configured movement participation and racial identity and then how whites crafted strategic narratives of the self to account for their participation in a status-based movement they were not directly implicated in. We conclude with an analysis of the implications of these narratives for a critical politics of recognition."
1	"Analyses of neighborhood racial composition in 1980-2000 demonstrate that in multiethnic metropolitan regions there is an emerging pathway of change that leads to relatively stable integration These are ""global neighborhoods"" where Hispanics and Asians are the pioneer integrators of previously all-white zones, later followed by blacks. However, region-wide segregation is maintained at high levels by whites' avoidance of all-minority areas and by their continued exodus (albeit at reduced levels) from mixed settings. Globalization of neighborhoods adds a positive new element of diversity that alters but does not erase the traditional dynamic of minority invasion succession."
1	Analyses of the National Crime Victimization Survey and Supplemental Homicide Reports show that southern whites are much more likely than northern whites to be victims of gun homicides and assaults, but not other homicides and assaults. While blacks are more likely than whites to be victims of gun assaults (regardless of region). they have lower risks of assault victimization by unarmed offenders. The patterns are inconsistent with the subculture of violence thesis. In addition, incident analyses reveal that patterns of weapon use primarily reflect the race of the victim not the offender. Our results point to the importance of adversary effects: Offenders avoid assaulting blacks and southern whites unless they have guns because members of these groups are perceived as a greater threat. We suggest that the prevalence of armed assault in a community may lower the likelihood of unarmed assaults, and that honor culture explanations may be salvageable. 
0	The study explores the relationship between family dinners and vulnerability to victimization in a Northeastern six state sample. Plrimlimary analysis indicates a linear inverse relationship between engagement in family dinner and victimization to bullying, rape, and verbal and physical abuse. Further multivariate analysis will be done to determine the independent and joint impact of family dinners on victimization.
1	"Recent public health research has consistently reported that self-identified multiracial adolescents tend to display more problem behaviors and psychological difficulties than monoracial adolescents. Relying on insights from qualitative analyses using small or clinical samples to interpret these empirical patterns, these studies implicitly assume a pejorative stance toward adolescents' multiracial self-identification. Building on the social psychological arguments underlying Park's and Stonequist's seminal discussions of the ""marginal man,"" we derive hypotheses indicating that self-identified multiracial adolescents may show more psychological difficulties, but are also likely to have more active social interaction and participation than monoracial groups. We also incorporate later elaborations of the marginal man theory to develop alternative hypotheses regarding multiracial youth's school and behavioral outcomes. Based on a nationally representative sample of racially self-identified youth, the results suggest that patterns of multiracial-monoracial differences are generally consistent with the hypotheses derived closely from the marginal man theory or its subsequent elaborations. We examine the heterogeneities within these general patterns across different multiracial categories and discuss the implications of these findings."
0	The rise in obesity prevalence over the last several decades has significant consequences for the health of individuals and populations. Like most health conditions, lower SES groups experience a disproportionate share of the obesity burden in the United States. Fundamental cause theory suggests that individuals from lower SES backgrounds lack access to resources, such as money, power, and prestige, that allow higher SES individuals to thwart the risk of disease.  However, recent trends show that the disparity in obesity prevalence between high and low SES adults and children is narrowing. Obesity prevalence in recent years appears to be increasing at a faster rate in high SES groups, suggesting that, in the case of obesity, access to socioeconomic resources has not been as much of a protective factor as fundamental cause theory might predict.  This paper explores the social ecological trends associated with obesity in the United States, and how these trends may have differentially impacted low and high SES children. I find that economic resources, namely food insecurity, is associated with obesity among low SES children, while time constraints, as measured by mother’s employment, is associated with obesity among high SES children.
1	Comparisons of wellbeing between the United States and Western Europe generally show that most Americans have higher standards of living than do Western Europeans at comparable locations in their national income distributions. These comparisons of wellbeing typically privilege disposable income and cash transfers while ignoring other aspects Of we are state and labor market structure that potentially affect the distribution of wellbeing in a society. We argue that non-work time is such a factor. In this empirical exercise involving the United States and the Netherlands, we show that reasonable estimates of the contribution to wellbeing from non-market activities such as the raising of children or longer vacations can overturn claims in the literature that the United States offers greater wellbeing to more of its citizens than do western European countries.
0	"Network models are widely used to represent relational information among interacting units and the implications of these relations.  In studies of social networks recent emphasis has been placed on random graph models where the nodes usually represent individual social actors and the edges represent a specified relationship between the actors.  We consider models that allow the probability of relational ties between individuals to depend on the locations of individuals in some unobserved ""social space'.  We further extend these models to incorporate clustering information, using ideas drawn from model based clustering.  Inference clustering within the social space is developed within a likelihood and Bayesian framework.  We extend the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm from the latent space models to our latent clustering models.  We present the analysis of some real networks of social relations where the true clustering is known."
0	Although scholars are aware of the larger social forces that threaten rural communities, we know little about how local governments are dealing with these issues.  County governments are often at the receiving end of governmental mandates.  Counties must take on additional functions such as assisting with national security and helping to bridge the gaps with cuts in federal assistance for public health and poverty relief programsthis along side of enhancing the economic vitality of their communities.  This unique mixed-methods study, I collected data to assess local spending efforts to mitigate these social forces and to better understand the perspectives of the decision-makers.  In this presentation, I will specifically examine how county commissioners speak and see globalization affecting their communities and if they account for agency in how the can react to globalizing forces.
1	The sociology of aging draws on a broad array of theoretical perspectives from several disciplines, but rarely has it developed its own. We build on past work to advance and empirically test a model of mental health framed in terms of structural theorizing and situated within the life course perspective. Whereas most prior research has been based on cross-sectional data, we utilize four waves of data from a nationally representative sample of American adults (Americans' Changing Lives Study) collected prospectively over a 15-year period and find that education, employment and marital status, as well as their consequences for income and health, effectively explain the increase in depressive symptoms after age 65. We also found significant cohort differences in age trajectories of mental health that were partly explained by historical increases in education. We demonstrate that a purely structural theory can take us far in explaining later life mental health.
1	This article examines the classic question of how religious diversity in a community affects church membership in a period of high growth and social change. Using panel data on local U. S. communities from 1890 to 1926, the authors estimate models specified to overcome likely artifactual problems, deal with unobserved community-specific heterogeneity, and model state dependence. In general, the findings support the plausibility of mechanisms based on pluralistic deobjectivation and identity activation; they do not support predictions from mechanisms based on organization-environment matching and interdenominational competition. The findings also show that the overall effect of urbanization on church participation was positive in all but the most religiously diverse communities.
0	Despite the well-established relationship between educational attainment and physical health status, it is not entirely evident that the association is consistent across diverse racial and ethnic groups.  In this study, we examine education, and test its association with health for a large ethnic category, Asian Americans.  We specifically test whether the education/health association is context driven, that is, whether the association depends on where the education was received.  This study uses data from a recently completed national survey of Asian Americans, the National Latino and Asian American Survey (NLAAS), to describe the association between educational attainment and self-rated health among Asian Americans employing a human capital framework, and to determine how the source of an individuals education structures the education and health association.  Though the well-established education gradient in health is initially supported, this relationship does not hold after other health-related factors are accounted for.  The findings also indicate that the source of an individuals education moderates the relationship between educational attainment and self-rated health.  Asian Americans who receive most of their education outside of the United States have significantly lower health returns to their education than U.S.-educated Asian Americans.
0	In this paper, I examine a fundamental sociological question: how does conflict between groups affect relations within groups?  I present a theory specifying the conditions under which groups in conflict will develop stricter norms and more centralized systems of leadership than groups at peace.  I evaluate the theory using a laboratory study that tests the causal mechanism while controlling for factors that complicate the study of conflict in the field. Using the intergroup prisoners dilemma paradigm (Bornstein 2003), I find that intergroup conflict interacts with cultural values to shape group cohesion (contribution to collective action), support for social norms (willingness to engage in costly punishment of those who do not contribute to the group), and the centralization of authority (willingness to switch from a democratic decision-making system to an autocratic system). The results suggest that group conflict plays an important causal role in norm emergence, costly punishment, and the establishment of group hierarchies.  The results support classical sociological theories while providing a clearer picture of the causal mechanism.  On a practical level, the results suggest that conflict resolution efforts could benefit from emphasizing relationships within as well as between groups.
1	Using children of immigrants sample from National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study investigates how immigrant youth acculturating to the American social norm of volunteering and how the acculturation is modified by living in immigrant neighborhoods Multilevel logistic regression produces distinct patterns for children living in high-SES and low-SES neighborhoods In high-SES neighborhoods, being among foreign-born residents serves as a buffer against acculturating to the social norm for youth, and this buffer has an enduring impact when they enter Into their early adulthood Conversely, in low-SES neighborhoods, acculturating to this social norm is irrelevant to the proportion of foreign-born residents in their neighborhoods However, the experience of growing up in such neighborhoods has the potential to enhance the acculturation to volunteering when the adolescents enter into young adulthood The findings shed new light on segmented assimilation theory that is, being among the foreign-born not only could prevent immigrant youth from downward assimilation, but also could restrict acculturation to positive social norms
0	Non-medical factors have been shown to play an important role in medical decision-making.  As salient and socially-relevant attributes, excess body mass and its distribution are factors that may influence the course of treatment that hospitalized patients receive, perhaps even at advanced stages of care.  This paper asks whether body mass and composition affect patients likelihood of being admitted to cardiac care units (CCU), and whether the process differs by gender.  Analyses make use of hospital records abstracted prospectively over 20 years from a national survey of adults 25 to 74 years of age at baseline who were hospitalized during the survey (N=4,229).  Anthropometric data, self-reported morbidity, and health care resource information are also used.  Parameters are estimated with logistic regression with robust standard errors to account for the multistage sampling design.  Results indicate that Body Mass Index was associated with greater likelihood of CCU admission, but that central adiposity was related to greater likelihood of CCU admission for women only.  The findings suggest that medical personnel use non-medical information when considering serious treatment options for patients, but that adiposity distribution is evaluated differently in men and women.
1	We examine the origins of voluntary associations devoted to environmental protection, focusing on the divergent trajectories of industrialized versus developing countries. We consider a wide range of domestic economic, political, and institutional dynamics that give rise to environmental associations. Developing and extending neo-institutional world polity arguments, we characterize domestic association in the developing world as the product of global cultural models, legitimation, and resources. Using event history and dynamic panel models, we analyze the formation of domestic environmental associations for a large sample of countries in the contemporary period. Among highly industrialized countries, domestic factors-resources and political institutions that afford favorable opportunities-largely explain the prevalence of environmental associations. In contrast, global forces are a powerful catalyst for environmental organizing in the developing world. The environmental movement, which had domestic origins in the West, became institutionalized in the world polity, generating new associations on a global scale. We also find positive effects of democratic institutions and philanthropic foundations. Environmental degradation and societal affluence are not primary drivers of environmental association. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of globally-sponsored voluntary associations, which appear to be common in the developing world.
0	This paper explores the possibility that the self is structured like a network, and that it takes on different identities according to its internal configurations.  It builds on Wileys theory (1994) of the semiotic self and network theory as recently conceptualized by Fuchs (2000). The paper suggests that the semiotic self is a level of social association. It is the result of a structural configuration and, is open to solidarity rituals (both internal and external), and power-rituals, much like other levels of observation  such as encounters, groups, organizations and networks -  are. Being a structure/container as opposed to a particularized essence, the self is also open to shifting outsider/insider boundaries: in other words, the observable outcome of the process of self-formation is the attribution of a network, i.e. personhood is constructed. The paper discusses the implications of a network theory of the self for the debate on identity politics, and uses historical illustrations from the womens movement in the US to demonstrate the ways in which essentialism and constructivism are produced.
0	This paper examines the concept of headship in its relationship to older persons living arrangements in the Agincourt sub-district of Mpumalanga Province, South Africaan area with 32% HIV-prevalence. We concentrate on headship as a measure of older persons position in rural households, considering the role non-contributory old-age pensions as a collective household asset play in living arrangements. Using qualitative data from the site, we first examine the meaning of headship to older persons and their household members. Then we use descriptive statistics to outline the traits of household heads in the site, compare the characteristics of households across age and sex headship types, and explore how households composition and experience of a death differ across headship types. While there are some significant differences in household composition across headship types, this analysis does not point to a significantly greater presence of HIV/AIDS deaths in households headed by older persons over the period. These findings are an important starting point for further investigations aimed at understanding how HIV/AIDS is impacting the lives of older persons.
1	Occupations are central to the stratification systems of industrial countries, but they have played little role in empirical attempts to explain the well-documented increase in wage inequality that occurred in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. We address this deficiency by assessing occupation-level effects on wage inequality using data from the Current Population Survey for 1983 through 2008. We model the mean and variance of wages for each occupation, controlling for education and demographic factors at the individual level to test three competing explanations for the increase in wage inequality: (1) the growth of between-occupation polarization, (2) changes in education and labor force composition, and (3) residual inequality unaccounted for by occupations and demographic characteristics. After correcting for a problem with imputed data that biased Kim and Sakamoto's (2008) results, we find that between-occupation changes explain 66 percent of the increase in wage inequality from 1992 to 2008, although 23 percent of this is due to the switch to the 2000 occupation codes in 2003. Sensitivity analysis reveals that 18 percent of the increase in inequality from 1983 to 2002 is due to changes in just three occupations: managers ''not elsewhere classified,'' secretaries, and computer systems analysts.
0	The relationships among education, health, and mortality in the Asian society such as Taiwan have merited more and more attention in the sociological literature. Nevertheless, whether these education-health patterns extend to depression and whether these associations explained by social relationships are much less known. This study hence aims to assess the effects of education and social relationships on depression and mortality by respectively utilizing the latent growth curve model and the Gompertz hazard models on the longitudinal data from the 1989-2003 Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan. The preliminary results suggest: First, Taiwanese elderly with higher levels of education tend to have lower levels of initial depression and less depression exacerbation over time. Education also predicts lower risks of dying. Second, social relationshipssocial support, dissatisfaction toward emotional support, levels of respondents family be critical, and widowhoodonly slightly mediate the impacts of education, though social relationships themselves provide independent effects on depression and mortality. Finally, the effects of education on mortality are not mediated through baseline depression.
1	Studying families in post-war London, Elizabeth Bott hypothesized that tight-knit kinship networks fostered gender segregated, rather than joint, conjugal role-relationships for husband and wife. Addressing this hypothesis with 2001 International Social Survey Program for 29 countries, this paper considers one aspect of joint role-relationships - whether married women prefer to turn to their husband, as opposed to kin, for household help and emotional support. Women with tight-knit kin who fill multiple functions in their lives are less likely to prefer to rely on husbands. Residential mobility is associated with greater reliance on the spouse, but there is no indication that the importance of kinship is diminished when mobility is controlled. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The AMP BTD program is a two-year program focused on “effective strategies for recruiting, retaining, preparing and graduating its [mostly minority student] participants at the Masters level in STEM [science, technology, engineering, and math] disciplines and encouraging their participation in educational pursuit at the Ph.D. level.” This ethnographic study draws from five rounds of interviews with the students and observations of program events and meetings. The major goals of this research were to assess: 1) what challenges and barriers do these students experience when they enter graduate school, 2) what institutional policies and practices help minority student retention and success in graduate school, and 3) what fosters their self-confidence and sense of belonging in STEM fields. The major findings include: 1) students experienced the most challenges with time management, family commitments, performance anxiety, and meeting expectations, 2) although the cohort and leadership team were important sources of support, students needed stronger mentorship about meeting departmental expectations and career planning, and 3) EU BTD achieved an impressive 82 percent success rate, with nine of the eleven matriculating into PhD programs. The results of this study have important implications for the growing national concern about minority student access, retention, and success in STEM fields, with particular interests for industry employers, researchers, policy makers and university administrators.
1	A new approach to investigation of human influences on the environment identifies social organization as an influence independent of population size, affluence, and technology. The framework also identifies population events, such as births, that influence the environment. The authors use longitudinal, multilevel, mixed-method measures of local land use changes, population dynamics, and social organization to test this framework. These tests reveal that changes in social organization are strongly associated with changes in land use independent of measures of population size, affluence, and technology. Also, local birth events shape local land use changes and key proximate determinants of land use change.
0	The left and center-left rose to power in many European Union (EU) countries in the 1990s.  Particularly with the ascendance of Tony Blair, a clear two-level trend thus emerged in Europe: a strong pro-Europeanism among national political leadership, welded with policy principles that embraced the market and promoted an opportunity-oriented social investment welfare concept.  Thus, even as national leaders (in the form of the European Council ) sought a more social program for the EU integration project, they also sought to reform labor markets and social protection systems on national-level.  This paper traces the EU-level search for a social model in the context of a broad set of market-oriented shifts on national level, and offers early arguments as to their interrelationship.  The hypothesis under examination is that, between 1995 and 2005, national-level blame avoidance politics (Pierson 1996; Pierson 2001)which involved, in part, pointing to the EU as the enforcer of unpopular reformsundermined the EU-level social democratic project to define and preserve a European social model during a crucial moment of institutional transition.
1	The potential for improving response rates by changing from one mode of data collection to another mode and the consequences for measurement and nonresponse errors are examined. Data collection from 8999 households was done in two phases. Phase I data collection was conducted by telephone interview, mail, interactive voice response, or the Internet, while Phase 2 focused on nonrespondents to Phase 1, and was conducted by a different mode, either telephone or mail. Results from our study suggest that switching to a second mode is an effective means of improving response. We also find that for the satisfaction-dissatisfaction questions asked in this survey, respondents to the aural modes (telephone and IVR) are significantly more likely than are respondents to the visual modes (mail and web) to give extreme positive responses, a difference that cannot be accounted for by a tendency towards recency effects with telephone. In general, switching to a second mode of data collection was not an effective means of reducing nonresponse error based on demographics. 
0	During almost forty years the concept of medicalization has mainly been used to examine women’s health. In the area of mental health, the notion of gender and mental health has even more been equated with women.  The only mental health issue which is specifically concerned with men is related to the impact of combat experience for men’s health. Much of this literature has been gender-neutral in the sense that it is taken for granted that it is a health issue that affects men and that the term “war veteran” means a man. Mental health symptoms inflicted by war experiences has been a topic of both resistance and contestation among war veterans themselves. In this area the term medicalization can be used as an analytical tool to understand how war veterans have negotiated for a diagnosis of their symptoms. The psychiatric label used is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The literature for this review has been collected by searching PubMed database by using the term PTSD. I will show that resistance to or contestation of the medicalization of masculinity is an underlying theme in this research literature.
1	Social characteristics that differ by place of residence are consequential For health. To study implications of this among older adults in rural vs. urban China, this study employs data from the Beijing municipality, a region that has witnessed growth and gaps in development. Life and active life expectancy is assessed using a multistate life table technique that estimates hazard rates and subsequent expected years in various health states. Hazards are estimated for a model that adjusts regional differences for age and sex and for a series of other models including additional covariates. Results indicate urban residents have an advantage. Specific factors show socio-economic status and access to health service account for a large part, social support and health behaviors For little, while disease is a suppressor.
1	This study examines the economic returns to schooling acquired in the country of origin and the Country of destination. It uses large-scale Survey data oil Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Antillean immigrants in the Netherlands, which contain direct measures of pre- and post-migration schooling. It is studied whether the returns to origin-country schooling depend on contextual factors: i.e., immigrant group and the region of living. Furthermore, we examine the importance of host-country schooling for labor market outcomes and if these can be partly explained by increasing contacts with natives. Results show that the returns to origin-country schooling are higher for Surinamese and Antillean immigrants (i.e., those originating from former Dutch colonies) than for immigrants from Turkey and Morocco. The returns to origin-country schooling are not affected by ethnic concentration in the region of living. Finally, it appears that the returns to host-country schooling are much larger than to origin-country schooling, and the higher returns to host-country schooling cannot be explained by increased social contacts with natives.
0	This research examines differences in insurance coverage of Hispanic subgroups of the United States. Particular attention is paid to the impact of the immigration status including nativity, duration in the United States, and citizenship status  and its affect on insurance coverage. Data are pooled from the National Health Interview Survey for 2002-2003 and multinomial logistic regression models are estimated to compare Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Other Hispanics with non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks.  All Hispanic subgroups are much more likely than non-Hispanic whites to report Miscellaneous Insurance Coverage or No Coverage than Private Insurance Coverage.  There are wide differences in insurance coverage across racial and ethnic groups in the United States.

Fewer studies, however, examine how workplace racial composition affects individuals' experiences of racial discrimination or how these experiences impact workers' organizational attachment. To address this lacuna, we first examine the effects of workplace racial composition on perceived racial and ethnic discrimination. Next, we examine whether perceived racial discrimination mediates the association between racial composition and organizational attachment observed in prior studies. Finally, we explore whether these relationships are similar (symmetric) or different (non-symmetric) for non-Whites and Whites. The analyses indicate: (1) working with predominately same-race coworkers tends to diminish perceptions of racial discrimination, (2) perceived racial discrimination mediates some of the effects of racial/ethnic composition on organizational attachment, and (3) some non-symmetric effects between non-Whites and Whites are found. We conclude with implications for future research. 
1	In this article we methodologically assess the paradox posited by other researchers of fertility: namely, why fertility is so much lower in the familialistic countries of Southern and Eastern Europe. We examine the relationship between individual attributes, aggregate female labor force participation, child care enrollment, family leave, and individual fertility in 20 developed countries using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our results indicate that women's full-time employment and country-level employment rates decrease expected fertility in contrast to recent research which shows a reversal in the negative association between total fertility rates and female labor force participation during the 1980s. However, the positive association between child care enrollment and fertility indicates that child care services might mitigate some of the decline in fertility, possibly by reducing labor force exit among women with young children.

1	Social scientists generally seek to explain welfare-related behaviors in terms of economic, social structural, or culture of poverty theories. Such explanations, however do not for account for nativity differences in public assistance receipt among immigrants of Mexican origin. This article draws on the sociology of migration and culture literatures to develop a materialist-based cultural repertoire account and attendant hypotheses to explain the welfare behaviors of Mexican immigrants. We argue that such immigrants arrive and work in the United States under circumstances that foster employment-based cultural repertoires that, compared with natives and other immigrant groups, encourage less welfare participation (in part because such repertoires lead to faster welfare exits) and more post-welfare employment. This is particularly true in states with relatively, more generous welfare policies. Using individual-level data predating the Welfare Reform Act, from, multiple panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged with state-level information on welfare benefit levels, we examine immigrant-group differences in welfare receipt, retention, and transition to employment across locales with varying levels welfare benefits. Findings are largely consistent with our cultural repertoire account: Mexican immigrants tend to utilize welfare not primarily, to avoid work, cope with disadvantage, or perpetuate a culture of dependency, but rather to minimize the effects employment discontinuities. Such findings carry important theoretical and policy implications-implications we outline in our conclusion.
0	The U.S. Federal government is increasingly turning to outsourcing as a management strategy.  Combining permanent employees with contracted employees creates a bifurcated work setting resulting in differential structural and environmental job characteristic between full-time employees and contractors.   Analyses of the process and outcomes of Federal outsourcing have focused predominantly on economic costs and benefits and have failed to confirm its effectiveness.  In this paper I argue that social-psychological outcomes must also be considered in evaluating the effects of outsourcing.  Using the military as a field laboratory, data gathered from a case study of the Army are analyzed using path analysis to determine the direct and indirect effects of both the level of contact Soldiers have with contractors and social comparisons with contractors on their intent to remain with the Army.  Findings indicate that Soldiers feel relatively deprived compared to the contractors with whom they work and that these feelings of deprivation negatively impact Soldiers intentions to remain in the Army past their current enlistment.  These effects operate indirectly through job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and are not affected by level of contact with contractors.  Implications of these results and recommendations for future research are discussed.

Yet the mass media constitute a significant component of the social context in which aging is experienced and understood. To make meaning of aging and its various experiences, and to transmit them from one generation to the next, the society draws on various cultural and media products such as novels, films, paintings, and media texts and images. Through thematic analysis of 146 articles featuring older adults in various contexts including family, work, civic engagement, social policy, health care, consumer market, and leisure published in The Globe and Mail in 2004-2006, this paper deconstructs stereotypes of successful aging. Findings from this study suggest that media discourses of successful aging perpetuate exclusion of marginalized adults and provide the cultural legitimization for persistent social inequalities in terms of gender, class, age, and health status. This paper sheds light on intra-generational media ageism whereby some older adults, particularly older women, are blamed for failing to age well, while the structural determinants of late-life disadvantage are made invisible.
1	This article argues that a modified version of Bourdieu's habitus concept can generate insights into moral Culture and the ways people use culture to make changes in their lives. If revised in light of recent findings from cognitive neuroscience, the habitus allows for the analysis of culture as embodied cognitive structures linking individuals to primary-group discourses. To demonstrate the utility of this conception, I examine the unique abstract language and embodied metaphors used by members of religious and secular overeaters' internet Support groups. The religious group used far more cleanliness metaphors, and members who made frequent use of such metaphors remained with. the group longer and posted more messages. This effect was not found for either group's abstract language or for the secular group's embodied metaphors. The findings suggest chat a Cultural influence on social bonding can be shown when Culture is operationalized in terms of embodied cognitive schemas that operate within both the habitus and group discourses. Also, traditionally religious moral culture may be more strongly associated with Cultural coherence and social bonding than is modernist culture.
1	Previous research fails to address whether contingent employment benefits individuals' careers more than the alternative they often face: being without a job. Using work history data from Japan, this study shows that accepting a contingent job delays individuals' transition to standard employment more than remaining jobless. Moreover, having a contingent job, rather than having no job, leads Japanese men to have lower occupational status after they transition back to standard employment. I argue that in a highly segmented labor market like Japan's, the strict separation of labor pools for standard and contingent jobs makes being labeled as a contingent worker particularly detrimental. Meanwhile, the legacy of Japan's welfare corporatism alleviates the stigma of unemployment, making individuals better off jobless than having a contingent job. This research thus demonstrates the importance of labor-market contexts in shaping the scarring effects of contingent work arrangements.

In this paper, I ask, what is the relationship between gender and sexuality?  More specifically I ask, how do heteronormative and homophobic interactions, discourses and practices produce a dominant masculinity?  To answer these questions I follow the deployment of, resistance to, and practices surrounding the word ""fag"" among teenagers in a public high school. Using Judith Butlers concept of the ""constitutive outside"" I argue that the threat of the ""fag,"" as the ""constitutive outside,"" is so powerful that teenagers, teachers and the organization of the school itself all work not only to repudiate the ""fag"" but also actively work to produce a dominant, heterosexual masculinity."
0	George Herbert Mead, although a philosopher himself, is primarily referred to in contemporary scholarship by sociologists.  This has not always been the case, rather it is the result of a transformation in the predominant understandings of his work in the first half of the twentieth century.  Utilizing a uniquely constructed dataset, which includes informal references as well as formal citations, this paper traces the shifts in the legacy of G. H. Mead in American academic disciplines.  I build on scholarship in the sociology of knowledge and the history of sociology in demonstrating that the dominant understanding of Mead is the result of identifiable social practices of interpretation and reference.  In particular, this analysis highlights the importance of social institutions and personal relationships in determining patterns of knowledge transfer.
0	Wilson (1987) spearheaded the argument that concentrated poverty in a neighborhood had deleterious consequences for its residents.  Central to this notion is that socio-economic homogeneity leaves residents socially isolated without exposure to working and middle class people.  Using a conceptual framework that differentiates the community contexts as homogeneous or heterogeneous in terms of socio-economics, this article examines heterogeneity in the social networks of low-income women. Through a comparative ethnography with African-American women in a mixed income housing development in Chicago and Latin-American immigrant women living in a socioeconomically homogeneous housing development in Boston we look to find out 1) Does living in a mixed income housing development result in increased heterogeneity in the social networks of African-American low-income residents? 2)  Does living in a socioeconomically homogeneous public housing development results in homogeneous social networks for Latin-American immigrant low-income women? 3) What are some of the explanatory factors behind the creation or avoidance of intergroup tie formation? Findings indicate that while the African-American women have access to heterogeneity, it is only socio-economic; they otherwise maintain racially homogeneous networks. Latin-American immigrant women have both racial and socio-economic heterogeneity in their networks.  We found that in both groups, individual agency and frames played a significant role in the development of heterogeneity and social mobility.  Homogeneity in networks was explained by women who were traumatized from domestic and neighborhood violence. Findings indicate that intervention is the form of bridges and mental health services could put these women back in the flow towards social mobility.
1	Women have made significant inroads into management in recent decades, yet remain underrepresented in leadership positions in large firms. In this article, I assess the critical but seldom analyzed role that widespread corporate restructuring may play in generating these inequalities. I build on social-cognitive research and the opportunity structure for discrimination framework to develop contrasting predictions of the effects from two forms of restructuring-reductions in force and reorganization of human resource management systems-on sex differences in managerial promotion. Analyses of longitudinal personnel records from a Fortune 500 manufacturing firm-a firm that restructured multiple times over the period examined-are consistent with the opportunity structure for discrimination framework and suggest that the firm responded to gender equity pressures to promote women when afforded the opportunity to do so. Women promotion rates were higher than men during restructuring, relative to previous years, with a greater difference at higher-status job levels. Importantly, however few women transitioned into upper management positions in the firm during the restructuring period because (1) reductions in force slowed promotion rates for all managers, (2) women began their careers in lower-status jobs to begin with, relative to men, and (3) women promotion advantages were often short-lived. I conclude by discussing implications of my findings for research on organizational dynamics and gender inequality.
0	This article analyzes the ways that the skateboarding subculture maintains ideals of the authentic participant in light of the interactions between the subculture and mainstream culture.  Using interview data and content analysis of skateboard forum discussions, the author examines the specific values of the skateboarding subculture and how these values are applied to famous professional skateboarders and other members under contention.  This article describes the logic used by subculture members to create a specific personal identity that negotiates the conflicts between subcultural and mainstream values, as well as the interplay between the skateboarders’ understandings of the subculture and mainstream culture’s ideas of it.  The author concludes that when judging the authenticity of a skateboarder’s identity, other skateboarders mediate their decision through how well that skateboarder adheres to subcultural values, as well as details of their professional career.  The author also provides an example that is in contention with Hebdige’s idea that authenticity becomes less important to a subculture as it becomes subsumed by mainstream culture (1979).
0	Teacher professional development is widely promoted as a means to improve the quality of teaching and at the same time reduce inequalities in learning opportunities for students across schools in the U.S.  While professional development may raise the quality of teaching, whether it will reduce inequality is another matter.  Teachers in schools with greater capacity (i.e., those with more material, human, and social resources) may get more professional development, exacerbating the gap between schools serving advantaged and disadvantaged students.  If this occurs, it would compound the unequal distribution of teacher quality that already exists.  This paper uses survey and administrative data from a larger study of teacher professional development in elementary science to assess the implications for inequality of professional development as a strategy to improve teaching.  The data pertain to nearly 600 teachers in 80 elementary schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District.  Teacher survey responses indicated differences between schools in levels of resources in six domains: teacher professional preparation, principal leadership, professional development climate, teachers leading their own learning, administrative support for teaching, and collaborative learning in science.  Aside from a small number of majority-white schools, schools with greater concentrations of poor students exhibit lower levels of capacity on these scales.  Moreover, several aspects of school capacity are positively associated with the extent of teacher professional development in science.  Consequently, professional development initiatives that ignore school capacity are likely to magnify inequalities in professional development and thus the quality of teaching across schools.
1	Social scientists often arrive at opposite portrayals of American race relations, despite relying on identical data sources. Depending on their ideological predispositions, they either minimize or maximize remaining racial inequalities. The election of President Obama suggests that the reality of American race relations likely falls somewhere in between - but where?
0	Using the 2007 National Survey of Latinos, administered by the Pew Hispanic Center, this paper will examine the Latino perception of four aspects of the latest education reform policy No Child Left Behind: standardized testing, bilingual education, socioeconomic status and cultural competency. This sample (N= 1,508) is comprised of Hispanic/Latino adults 18 years of age and older, who were surveyed in October and November of 2007. The survey contained multiple demographic measures of socioeconomic status, as well as questions with regard to the perception of various Latino social issues in the United States. This paper will analyze four main hypotheses: (H1) Latinos are less likely than whites to perceive standardized tests as an accurate indicator of a student’s progress and abilities; (H2) Education will have more of an effect on whites than Latinos, with regard to their perception of standardized testing as a valid indicator for the allocation of funds for local schools; (H3) Whites are more likely than Latinos to believe public schools do a good job of teaching English to children  who are immigrants or who have parents who are immigrants; (H4) The worse off the perception of schools comprised  primarily of Latino children, the more likely cultural difference would be perceived as the reason why Latino students are not doing as well academically as white students. Results yield differences in perception toward the above mentioned aspects of education reform between Latino and non-Latino respondents
0	Mass media play a critical role in political processes because of its ability to influence the public agenda.  Media do not tell audiences what to think, but they do affect what people think about by deciding which political issues will be covered, and by choosing to emphasize specific aspects of those issues (Baumgartner and Jones 1993).  This paper looks at media coverage of the global warming debate to investigate the frames successful in gaining media coverage on both sides of the debate, and what actors are associated with these frames.  Using content analysis of The New York Times and Science News I find that, 1) over time there was an increase in the coverage of global warming, and 2) as the media coverage increased, the ideas presented became more contested by opponents.  Moreover, I find that as the scientific evidence supporting global warming increased, the media debate pitted scientists on one side of the issue, against politicians and economists on the other.  This helped create an issue stalemate as competing actors presented a policy dilemma in which the solution to one problem (global warming) created a new and potentially worse problem (economic collapse).
1	"Housing represents an important arena within which racial inequalities continue to manifest-a fact highlighted in housing audit studies and the substantial literature on racial residential segregation. In this article, we extend the insights of prior work by: (1) denoting the wide range of ""exclusionary"" discriminatory practices that transpire at distinct stages of the rental/sales process and that are too varied to be captured by any singular audit design; (2) analyzing something that audits simply cannot, namely discrimination that occurs within already established housing arrangements (i.e., nonexclusionary discrimination). We draw from qualitative and quantitative data truly unique to the literature, reflecting approximately 750 instances of housing discrimination discrimination verified by civil rights investigators following state and federal guidelines. Quantitative patterns denote unique and disparate vulnerability, especially for African American women, and the centrality of powerful institutional (i.e., banks, realtors, insurance companies, etc.) and more proximate actors (i.e., landlords and neighbors) in reifying racial disadvantage. Landlords are clearly on the ""front line"" with regard to both exclusionary and nonexclusionary forms. Neighbors, realtors, banks, and mortgage companies play a role as well, more or less, depending on the form of discrimination being examined. Qualitative immersion into case materials offers important insight on relevant processes pertaining to victim vulnerability and status, and how discriminatory actions themselves occur. We conclude by discussing the implications of our arguments and findings for future analyses of race and housing inequality, and for understanding stratification and its microinteractional dimensions generally."
1	"Explanations of the past both :VIM and influence the way we think about the present and future. Like artists and politicians, social movements develop a ""reputation"" that includes a capsule history of a movement's origins, goals, and impact. Both popular narratives and scholarly treatments identify four books published in the early 19605 as having spurred important social movements and government action. This ""big book myth"" provides a simple origins story for social movements, a version of an ""immaculate conception"" notion of social change. We compare the mythic accounts of feminist, environmental, anti-poverty, and consumer movements of the 1960s to fuller histories of these movements and find consistent distortions in the common big book narratives. Mythic accounts shorten the incubation time of social movements and omit the initiating efforts of government and political organizations. The myths develop and persist because they allow interested actors to package and contain a movement's origins, explicitly suggesting that broad social dynamics replicate idealized individual conversion stories. They also allow actors to edit out complicated histories that could compromise the legitimacy of a movement or a set of policy reforms. These mythic accounts spread and persist because they simplify complicated social processes and offer analogues to the individual process of becoming active, but they may lead us to misunderstand the past and make misjudgments about collective action and social change in the future. We consider those implications and call for more research on the construction of myths about the past."
0	In this paper, we take as a starting point the question of how epidemiologic facts concerning the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) are generated and come to be accepted as real. Using qualitative data from a vignette-based factorial experiment, we find that physicians are engaged in a highly varied process of identifying and interpreting a range of physiologic and non-medical cues from a standardized video vignette as they make decisions for a case of CHD. These diagnostic pathways expose key junctures wherein physicians are detoured to alternative diagnoses, their certainty of CHD lowered, and scientific logic makes it difficult to return to a CHD diagnosis.  Importantly, these processes may help explain observed demographic variations in epidemiologic rates. While social constructionist and labeling theories have long traditions in sociology, these results underscore the importance of their ongoing application to health disparities research.
1	At present, most work examining the well-documented relationship between social inequality and body size treats fatness as an effect, caused either by some factor that determines weight and social class simultaneously, or by social class itself. However, the relationship between weight and social inequality is more complex than these explanations suggest. Recent studies by John Cawley (2004) and Charles Baum and William Ford (2004) suggest that fatness is often a contributor to inequality, not merely an effect.
0	The goal of this paper is to explain the presence of university recognized LGBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender) student groups on the college and university campuses in six U.S. states. Significant research has documented the challenges faced by GLBT students on campus, but few studies examine why certain universities are more institutionally supportive than others, including which colleges have student groups—an important form of institutional support.  Drawing upon data from a wide range of sources including the National Center of Education Statistics, the Gayellow Pages, and campus websites, I use logistic regression to examine the importance of three broad factors:  public opinion on campus; community resources; and the larger institutional environment.  Results suggest that the institutional characteristics are particularly important in explaining the presence of officially sanctioned LGBT groups.
1	In this paper, I analyze how the association between Mexico-U.S. migration and marriage varies across socioeconomic settings in origins. Using Mexican Migration Project data and employing bilevel survival analysis with controls for socioeconomic, migrant network, and marriage market characteristics and family size, I find that single people are most likely to migrate relative to those married in areas of recent industrialization, where the Mexican patriarchal system is weaker and economic opportunities for both men and women make post-marital migration less attractive. Marital status is not significant in agriculture-dependent areas, where the bargaining power of husbands might be higher relative to other settings; their age-profiles of earnings flatter: and remunerated female work scarcer, making migration attractive later in the life course. 
1	"We conducted a vignette survey to investigate the effects of situational factors-such as a group's size, the amount of status differentiation among its members, and the type of task on which they work-on respondents' reports of the ""fair allocation"" of resources to members of status-heterogeneous task groups. We argue that to the degree that situational factors make productivity, status and competence more relevant, allocators will increase the weight of equity compared to equality, and to the degree that they make the maintenance of positive relations among members relevant, allocators will decrease the weight of equity compared to equality. Each vignette described members of a status-unequal work group with three, four, or five members. We use status characteristics theory to calculate status inequality for each group. Groups' tasks were described as either regular or temporary, requiring either interdependent or independent relations between coworkers, and involving routine or nonroutine working conditions. Participants from the United States and from Turkey read a series of vignettes and for each wrote what they thought was the fairest salary for each group member. Using reward expectations theory, our balance model and reported allocations, we estimate empirically the weight of equity for respondents and vignettes. All of the situational factors we identify do affect the equity-equality balance, though some only in interactions. We demonstrate that our balance model of distributive justice provides a useful instrument to capture these effects. "
1	Whites, blacks and Latinos in the United States tend to live in different neighborhoods and attend different schools. Does this segregation influence youth in the long run? This study used longitudinal data from the NELS to see whether neighborhoods' or schools' proportion black and/or Latino during the high school years influences educational attainment through age 26. The analyses indicate that concentrations of blacks and Latinos in schools, but not zip code areas, associates with lower attainment in the long run. Students in predominantly black and Latino schools are less likely to earn a high school diploma or equivalent and to earn a bachelor's degree or more than similar students in predominantly white schools.
1	Despite its centrality to contemporary inequality, working poverty is often popularly discussed but rarely studied by sociologists. Using the Luxembourg Income Study (2009), we analyze whether an individual is working poor across 18 affluent democracies circa 2000. We demonstrate that working poverty does not simply mirror overall poverty and that there is greater cross-national variation in working than overall poverty. We then examine four explanations for working poverty: demographic characteristics, economic performance, unified theory, and welfare generosity. We utilize Heckman probit models to jointly model the likelihood of employment and poverty among the employed. Our analyses provide the least support for the economic performance explanation. There is modest support for unified theory as unionization reduces working poverty in some models. However, most of these effects appear to be mediated by welfare generosity. More substantial evidence exists for the demographic characteristics and welfare generosity explanations. An individual's likelihood of being working poor can be explained by (a) a lack of multiple earners or other adults in one's household, low education, single motherhood, having children and youth; and (b) the generosity of the welfare state in which he or she resides. Also, welfare generosity does not undermine employment and reduces working poverty even among demographically vulnerable groups. Ultimately, we encourage a greater role for the welfare state in debates about working poverty. Keywords: poverty, work, working poor, social policy, labor markets.
1	Despite the theoretical emphasis on religious decline in modern societies sociologists remain divided over trends in religious activity and belief that support or refute claims of religious decline Much of this disagreement stems from the inability to distinguish between period and cohort effects when analyzing repeated cross-sectional survey data I use the intrinsic estimator a recently developed method of simultaneously estimating age period and cohort effects to examine changes in Americans religious service attendance prayer belief in the afterlife and biblical literalism Results show that regular service attendance declines predominantly across cohorts There are also period- and cohort-based declines in biblical literalism and a cohort-based decline in prayer Belief in the afterlife is relatively stable across periods and cohorts These results provide mixed support for theories of religious decline and they demonstrate the importance of differentiating between period and cohort effects on social change 
1	Disparities in cesarean rates in the United States represent an important social problem because cesareans are related to maternal deaths and to the high cost of American health care. There are pervasive racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in maternity care as in health care more generally, yet there has been little scrutiny of how overuse of cesarean deliveries might be linked to these disparities. There are at least two possibilities when it comes to c-sections: black, Hispanic, Native American, and low socioeconomic status (SES) mothers could be less likely to have needed cesareans, leading to more negative outcomes for both mothers and babies, or they could be more likely to have medically unnecessary cesareans, leading to more negative outcomes as a result of the surgery itself This research uses data on all recorded births in the United States in 2006 to analyze differences in the odds of a cesarean delivery by race-ethnicity and SES. The analysis reveals that non-Hispanic black, Hispanic/Latina, and Native American mothers are more likely to have cesarean deliveries than non-Hispanic white or Asian mothers. Also, after accounting for medical indications, increasing education is associated with a decline in odds of a cesarean delivery, especially for non-Hispanic whites. The results suggest that high cesarean rates are an indicator of low-quality maternity care, and that women with racial and socioeconomic advantages use them to avoid medically unnecessary cesarean deliveries rather than to request them.
0	This paper examines the association between labor market inactivity and ethnic status, skills, and deviance outcomes among adult males in the United States. Recent research has examined the relationships between occupational outcomes and racial, skill and criminal outcomes, but little research has focused on the small but significant percentage of males who consistently fail to make the transition from school to work. Given that these individuals will ultimately become the unemployed, underclass of the next generation it is surprising that more research has not focused on this population.  Using 25 years of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY79) (n=5,600), we examine the correlates and determinants of labor market inactivity among adult males. The results indicate a strong relationship between ethnic minority status and inactivity as well as a connection between length of inactivity and noncognitive behaviors. Cognitive skills were not found to be related to inactivity net of noncognitive behaviors. Juvenile delinquency and time spend incarcerated were both found to be significantly related to the proportion of time spent inactive.
1	"Large-scale dam and infrastructure projects remain common and controversial means toward development and poverty reduction in the Global South. Development authorities often promote employment of local people as part of development and as a promise made to ""sell"" projects locally. Are these promises of employment fulfilled? And what are the race, class, and gendered consequences of the employment practices implemented at the sites of large-scale development projects? How the social organization of work at the sites of large-scale development projects may create and constitute particular dynamics of inequality has been understudied. This article analyzes the social organization of work at one dam site of a large-scale multidam infrastructure development project, the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP). Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in 1997 and 2000-2002 in two communities proximate to Katse Dam, I center my analysis on the social organization of work with two goals: first, I render visible the gendered, classed, and raced ways that bodies and labor are organized in the context of this megaproject, both producing and constituting global and local inequalities; and, second, I show how masculinities are mobilized hierarchically to privilege an international hegemonic masculinity over local masculinities, and how the gender order is largely maintained by excluding women from the ""privileges"" of development through keeping women second-class citizens. These conclusions raise critical questions regarding how work is organized at the sites of large-scale development projects, and suggest we give greater attention to how the sites of development may reproduce inequalities based in race, class, gender, and global status."
1	How does the structure of the world economy determine the gains from participation therein? In order to answer this question we conduct a state of the art network analysis of international trade to map the structure of the international division of labor (IDL) We regress cross-national variation an economic growth on positional variation and mobility of countries within the IDL from 1965 to 2000 We find that the highest rates of economic growth occurred to countries in the middle of the IDL over the course of globalization Second we find that upper tier positions in the IDL are converging with each other but diverging from the lower tier This suggests that the mechanism underlying the rapid economic growth in intermediate positions was their uniquely high rates of upward mobility in turn a function of their middling position Taken together these findings suggest that a country s long-term economic development is conditioned by its position in the IDL 
0	This paper is a critical theoretical of the gendered, heteronormative construction of ethnicity  Latinidad- by the Latina/o community in the United States and the consequent exclusion of queer Latinos from Latinidad. Queer Latina/os experience a triple jeopardous existence being race-ethnic and sexual minorities within the context of American society, the American (predominantly white) gay culture and the Latina/o community. However, the reification of patriarchal ideologies that privilege men in Latinidad and its embrace by both heterosexual and queer Latinos, positions queer Latinas in a particularly marginalized and excluded location as they are perceived as challenging heteronormative norms, thereby betraying their ethnicity. Queer Latinos and Latinas in particular are however challenging their marginalized positions within their ethnic community by becoming visible and developing a voice through the organizations that they are spearheading, the scholarship that they are creating and by talking about their lives. In so doing, they challenging constructed Latinidad and re-appropriating it to create spaces for their lives and realities as legitimate rather than sell-out Latina/os.
1	We show that the progress of technological knowledge is an inherently ecological process, wherein the growth rate of each technology domain depends on dynamics occurring in other technology domains. We identify two sources of ecological interdependence among technology domains First, there are symbiotic interdependencies, implying that the rate of growth of one technology domain is driven by the advances made in other technology domains. Second, some technology domains compete with each other, implying that the rate at which a given technology domain advances varies inversely with the competitive pressure it receives from other technology domains. Based on all the technological knowledge patented in the United States between 1975 and 1999, we find statistical support for our argument and hypotheses.
0	Ethnic enclaves have been portrayed as a valuable resource for immigrants, helping them adapt into U.S. labor markets.  A chief benefit of working within ethnic enclaves is ethnic solidarity, which enables immigrants to find employment in the United States despite their skill levels, limited English ability, and discrimination.  Some studies find that immigrants working within ethnic businesses earn higher wages than those working within non-ethnic businesses.  My study tests whether ethnic solidarity improves Mexican migrants labor markets, utilizing the Mexican Migration Project data.  In addition to ethnic solidarity, my study also tests whether other forms of obligation such as familial and friendship obligation impact migrant labor markets.  I do not find evidence that ethnic solidarity assists Mexican migrant workers in the U.S. labor market.  To the contrary, I show that ethnic solidarity leads them to low paying jobs within the informal economy.  However, familial and friendship obligation assist Mexican workers employed within Mexican businesses by providing them wages comparable to those earned at white firms.  In this study, I shatter the hypothesis that Mexican workers receive labor market advantages from their ethnic solidarity with Mexican business owners, but I highlight how familial and friendship obligation do provide them with improved labor market outcomes.
1	Increasing levels of democratic freedoms should, in theory, improve women's access to political positions. Yet studies demonstrate that democracy does little to improve women's legislative representation. To resolve this paradox, we investigate how variations in the democratization process-including pre-transition legacies, historical experiences with elections, the global context of transition, and post-transition democratic freedoms and quotas-affect women's representation in developing nations. We find that democratization's effect is curvilinear. Women in non-democratic regimes often have high levels of legislative representation but little real political power. When democratization occurs, women's representation initially drops, but with increasing democratic freedoms and additional elections, it increases again. The historical context of transition further moderates these effects. Prior to 1995, women's representation increased most rapidly in countries transitioning from civil strife-but only when accompanied by gender quotas. After 1995 and the Beijing Conference on Women, the effectiveness of quotas becomes more universal, with the exception of post-communist countries. In these nations, quotas continue to do little to improve women's representation. Our results, based on pooled time series analysis from 1975 to 2009, demonstrate that it is not democracy-as measured by a nation's level of democratic freedoms at a particular moment in time-but rather the democratization process that matters for women's legislative representation.
0	Whereas the term “school-to-work transition” (STW) implies a clear, discrete event, this increasingly prolonged transitional period is not always unidirectional and typically includes involvements in both school and work. Destandardization in the STW transition makes it especially difficult to assess the extent to which young people today “flounder” during this period. Using data from the Youth Development Study and hierarchical latent class analysis, this paper examines the interplay of educational and career attainment and its longer-term economic consequences. The findings show four STW pathways: two groups that attain careers through postsecondary education (via Bachelor’s or Associates/Vocational degrees) and two groups that do not (distinguished by attempting postsecondary education). Regression models show particularly negative economic outcomes in adulthood for the flounderers, accentuated by the Great Recession.
0	The social construction of youth, and age as a social inequality more generally, is reflected in and perpetuated by the built environment and the increasingly segregated social worlds that youth and adults inhabit.  Youth researchers and cultural geographers have studied the built environment and its role in constructing youth inequality, while subcultural researchers have studied the ways in which young people occupy spaces in ways that cultivate resistance.  However, few researchers have examined the ways in which adolescents develop as political actors and resist their subordination in overtly political ways, especially in relation to their occupation of the built environment.  This article maps the socio-spatial terrain of politicized high school student movements in Portland, Oregon and the East Bay of California.  Using participant-observation data collected over a 20 month period, and in-depth interviews with 40 youth movement organizers, I illustrate how youth movements strategically occupy public spaces connected to civil society in order to contest adolescent subordination, prescribed passivity, and dependence as young people in an adult-dominated society.
0	This paper explores the restructuring of social relations in contemporary China from a spatial perspectivehow transformations in built urban environment, caused by economic and political changes, bring about changes in the structure of social networks. Social networks here refer to neighbor, workplace and friend ties; kin networks are not discussed in the paper. Specifically, two dimensions of the structure of social networks are to be addressed: the size and social support functions of social networks. From 1950s to 1980s, the typical Chinese city was a mosaic of standardized work-unit living quarters. Social networks were spatially segmented a rich subculture of multiplex ties could be found within walled work-unit neighborhoods, however, there were very few ties across work-unit neighborhoods. Since the 1990s, the market reform has been transforming the cellular urban landscape into a more functionally differentiated one. The linkage between residence and workplace has weakened, and new commercial centers have reemerged in central city areas. Urban residents now report having more spatially liberated friend ties, while less workplace and neighbor ties. Moreover, urban residents seek more social support from friends than from workplace or neighbor networks. This paper argues that the newly built urban environment plays a central role in liberating social networks. This spatial reorganization, brought about by economic and political changes, creates spaces in which voluntary friend-ties take precedence over workplace and neighbor networks, and in which a novel civil society might develop.
1	"Beyond mothers' union status transitions, other adults' transitions into and out of the household contribute to family instability, particularly in early childhood. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (N congruent to 8550). this study examines associations between extended household transitions and age 2 cognitive development. A substantial minority of toddlers experiences these transitions, and their consequences vary by household member type, entry versus exit, and race/ethnicity. Extended household transitions predict lower cognitive scores for white children, but the selection of low-socioeconomic status families into extended households explains these disparities. Grandparent transitions predict significantly higher cognitive scores for African American and Latino children than whites, and some ""other adult"" transitions predict higher scores for Latinos than African Americans and whites. Extended household transitions' consequences are independent of co-occurring residential moves and partner transitions. Findings suggest that studying extended household transitions is useful for understanding children's early development, and their consequences vary by race/ethnicity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

0	The family is often understood as the social context essential for understanding individual propensity toward, and desistance from, criminal offending.  While family is defined broadly in the theoretical literature, empirical research often focuses exclusively on the ameliorative effects of marriage. Yet rates of marriage are extremely low among the criminally involved.  As such, an exclusive focus on marriage will explain relatively little about processes of criminal desistance.  In reflection of dramatic cultural change, demographers and sociologists of the family have moved beyond studying the family as a marital/non-marital binary. This broadening of the concept of family has yet to reach the literatures on crime and desistance, which remain largely reliant on a definition of family unchanged from that of Glueck and Glueck (1930) more than three-quarters of a century ago. This paper explores the expectations, conceptualizations, and experiences of former prisoners regarding heterosexual romantic relationships based on qualitative interviews with 16 male prisoners during their final month(s) in prison and first months after release. Our goal is to identify the processes through which romantic relationships (both traditional and non-traditional) contribute to or reduce involvement in crime. Our results suggest that the desistance literature needs to more fully incorporate advances in the sociology of the family, which now conceives of relationships along a continuum of social attachment (Ross 1995) by recognizing the various roles romantic relationships can play in desistance processes.
0	Contemporary juvenile courts in the U.S. simultaneously pursue two potentially contradicting goals: mending the deficiencies of children who lack blameworthiness, and punishing young criminal offenders.  Choosing between these two goals often requires court decision-makers to decide between rehabilitative programs intended to treat wayward youth, and punishment (such as incarceration) designed to deter crimes and protect the public.  In this paper I explore how juvenile court decision-makers balance these competing concerns.  I find that courtroom interaction produces a negotiated order that allows the consideration of both goals, through three strategies: (1) prosecutors punish juveniles in order to protect them; (2) defense attorneys use treatment programs as bargaining chips in negotiation; and (3) judges simultaneously considers both future welfare and punishment.  These three methods of balancing the competing concerns are shaped by the institutional roles and obligations of juvenile court defense attorneys, prosecutors and judges.
1	"What motivates compliance with ""toothless"" international human rights norms? This article analyzes the effectiveness of procedures that allow individuals to petition an international human rights body, the Human Rights Committee, alleging state abuse of their treaty-protected rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Using methodological tools that account for selection biases arising from a country's decision to authorize petitions and its subsequent propensity to be targeted by abuse claims, I find that basic civil rights and religious freedoms improved after states were found to have violated their human rights treaty obligations, whereas physical integrity abuses such as disappearances and extrajudicial killing were somewhat more impervious to change. These findings are interpreted with reference to the concept of ""coupling"" as borrowed from organizational sociology, and their implications for treaty design and enforcement are considered. "
0	This paper examines the fairly common Arab/Muslim immigrant parent strategy of sending their children to the homeland for high school and the role of this socialization process in adolescent American Muslim identity formation, the selective acculturation of second-generation American Muslim adolescents, and the overall economic success of second generation American Muslims in American society despite substantially hostile social conditions. Qualitative data are from 60 in-depth interviews with American Arab Muslim teenagers attending high school in Ramallah, Palestine; Amman, Jordan; and Sana’a and Aden, Yemen, set in the context of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the American Muslim experience.
0	Understanding gay mens fathering experiences advances theoretical knowledge on the social matrix of mens intimate relationships with children.   I draw upon my current research that explores the narratives of 22 gay fathers to detail how when gay men engage in fathering and family, they do so in a socially constructed society that assumes a dominant type of family.  Through individualized homophobia and institutionalized heterosexism, I explore how gay men navigate fathering and family in a heteronormative world.  I continue with an analysis of how fathering and family are social constructions that are actively created, maintained, and modified in specific situations.  I detail how fathers cope with the paradoxical task of making their families appear ordinary and making it known that they are unique.
0	Rising unemployment and declining fertility rates are two of the major challenges to contemporary welfare states. National governments sought to tackle these problems by demanding more flexibility from employees, for example through activating labor market policies, while simultaneously providing them with more flexibility, for example through family friendly policies. This paper examines whether, and to what degree, these policies actually impact people’s attitudes and perceptions. Do they indeed increase people’s willingness to be flexible (“attitudes towards employment flexibility”)? Do they really generate a positive view on the compatibility of work and family duties (“perceptions of work-life-flexibility”)? Can the different policies seeking to demand and provide flexibility be complementary or do work against each other? Using multilevel modeling techniques, we analyze individual level data from by the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) in combination with country level information from the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD). We find more stringent dismissal protection is associated with less employment flexibility but also with greater work-life flexibility.  Generous unemployment benefits, in contrast, seem to have a positive impact on workers’ attitudes towards employment flexibility. Generous family policies are apparently only related to positive perceptions of work-life flexibility among women.
1	Despite the large literature on the long-term effects of parental divorce, few studies have analyzed the effects of parental divorce on spouse selection behavior. However, the characteristics of one's spouse can have important effects on economic well-being and on marital success. We use discrete-time, event-history data from Finnish population registers to study the effects of parental divorce on entry into marriage with spouses who have different educational qualifications (both absolute and relative to one's own education), using conditional multinomial logistic regression models. The results show that Finnish children of divorce have lower rates of marriage than those from intact families. In particular, children of divorce have a lower likelihood of marrying spouses with secondary education or more, and especially low rates of marrying someone with a tertiary degree. The latter gap is smaller among those with tertiary education, as a result of the higher rates of homogamous marriage among the children of divorce with high education. Our findings suggest that children of divorce carry with them traits and behaviors that make them less marriageable candidates in the marriage market. We discuss the possible implications of these findings.
0	The Neighborhood Watch crime prevention program has seen substantial growth since its inception in the 1960s, yet the extent to which it contributes to the actual reduction of neighborhood crime is very much contested.  Does Neighborhood Watch then, provide benefits other than crime reduction, which might explain its continued growth? How does it manage to grow despite apparent failure of the programs objectives?  This study uses interview and archival data in order to understand what Neighborhood Watch block captains and police officers gain from the perpetuation of Watch groups.  This study finds that Neighborhood Watch is being used by both police and neighborhood participants as a means of creating a Gemeinschaft space in a larger neighborhood. The growth of Neighborhood Watch is also reflective of larger trends in U.S. political programs and strategies concerning social control.  It is also a class-based resource, more easily accessed and utilized by middle-class neighborhoods than others.  Lastly, Neighborhood Watch has been able to integrate effectively into neighborhoods that already have similar organizational structures.
1	There are sizeable earnings differentials by gender and race in the U.S. labor market, with women earning less than men and most racial/ethnic minority groups earning less than whites. It has been proposed in the previous literature that the effects of gender and race on earnings are additive, so that minority women suffer the full disadvantage of each status. We test this proposition for a broad range of minority groups in the United States. We find that women of all minority groups suffer a smaller gender penalty than white women (relative to same-race men). Exploring the potential role of racial variation in gender role specialization in producing such differentials, we find some empirical evidence suggesting that white families specialize more than families of most other races.
1	Ethnic social capital shapes economic action by immigrants by providing information training and credit that is otherwise unavailable However prior research on the effects of ethnic social capital on economic attainment by salaried workers primarily relied on case studies of specific destinations or ethnic groups Furthermore prior research focused on group level effects of ethnic social capital while largely ignoring the effects of individual-level utilization of ethnic ties This study addresses these limitations by combining data from the New Immigrant Survey and the 5% file of the 2000 US Census This allows controlling for group differences in actual utilization of familial ties and for differences between groups in their demographic makeup legal status and human capital when estimating the effect of ethnic social capital It also allows addressing the potentially divergent implications of ethnic social capital for individual and group economic attainment Results suggest that, on both the individual and group levels reliance on ethnic social capital is associated with lower earnings for recent legal immigrants to the US 
1	"This study introduces data from a new random sample of Japanese adults. Findings show that reporting of distress symptoms are: (1. positively associated with a religious coping index (i.e., beliefs that religion or supernatural beings provide comfort, support or protection), (2. associated in different directions with ownership of different household altars (positively for Shinto altars and negatively for ancestor altars), (3. negatively associated with frequency of ancestral grave visitations, (4. positively associated with certain beliefs (e.g., in supernatural beings), and (5. generally do not differ per religious identification (e.g., religious vs. not religious). Also, physical health and ""balance in life"" (i.e., balance between work/household obligations and leisure) are strongly and negatively associated with depression symptoms. Results indicate important distinctions between Japan and the United States concerning the relationship between religion and psychological distress."
1	Spending time in prison has become an increasingly common life event for low-skill minority men in the United States. The Bureau of Justice Statistics now estimates that one in three black men can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime. A growing body of work implicates the prison system in contemporary accounts of racial inequality across a host of social, health, economic, and political domains. However, comparatively little work has examined the impact of the massive increase in the prison system-and growing inequality in exposure to the prison system-on racial inequality over the life course. Using a unique data set drawn from state administrative records, this project examines how spending time in prison affects wage trajectories for a cohort of men over a 14-year period. Multilevel growth curve models show no evidence of racial divergence in wages in quarters leading up to incarceration. However, after release, wages grow at a 21 percent slower rate for black compared to white ex-inmates. Blacks also enjoy fewer wage returns to work history compared to their white counterparts. This research broadens our understanding of the sources of racial stratification over the life course and underscores the relevance of recent policy interventions in the lives of low-skilled minority men.
0	"That crisis of work theories have inadequately interrogated such forms of work as volunteering and neglected the growth in political attention paid to their economic relevance is contrasted by studies that aim to tease out the value of and purpose behind volunteerings labor, its cultural connotation, and the study of its social-attainment effects. In this study we look at the ""crisis of work"" account by Sennett and use data on volunteers to examine some of his assumptions about labor in the new cultural economy. Rather than assuming, with Gorz and others, that we are moving beyond a workplace-based society, we argue that alternative forms of creative work, which are both individually and collectively enhancing, are moving into the zone of work. Whether these change the subjective meanings of volunteering and the meaning of work as labor is a matter for investigation."
0	In this paper, we highlight some of the key findings from our forthcoming book, From Amsterdam to Amazonia: A Sociological Inquiry into How Matter, Space, and Technology Shape Globalization.  We examine the financial, technological, and political dynamics that have globalized the world economy since the beginnings of capitalism over 500 years ago through the prism of the worlds largest iron ore mine, Carajas in the Brazilian Amazon.  Our goals in this paper are a) to understand the profoundly local characteristics of Carajás, an enormous and very local hole in the ground, in pristine jungle remote from industry, dug by enormous machines to extract huge volumes of raw material to send to industrial centers half-way around the world in huge trains and ships; b) to explain how local processesdriven by capital, shaped by matter and space, and mediated by technologyare materially intensified and spatially expanded toward globalization; and c) to examine the local and global consequences of these processes.
0	There are as many strands in the discourse of world music as there are musical worlds invoked.  Some celebrate the postmodern pastiche, or hybridity, that marks the borrowing between and among diverse musical cultures.  Others are descriptive, providing to outsiders a guide to the exotic, a view of the musical other, or a narrative of the development of musical forms.  Analytical questions have been posed concerning social categories of race, class, nation (and less often, gender); or the conditions of production and distribution, global and local.  There is some work on matters of place, identity or local politics, as well as ethnomusicological analyses of specifically musical elements.   But I have never seen the question raised, is it art?  This paper explores what that question entails, why it isnt being asked (at least with respect to world music), and why it matters.
0	Building on previous concepts of structurally induced homophily, I propose differences in the social networks of people who move from people who spend their lives in one place. Relationships are formed through different kinds of settings for the two, leading to homophily on different dimensions. I test these ideas using network data from the 1985 and 1998 General Social Survey, the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality 1992-1994, and the National Health and Social Life Survey 1992. The results are mixed and largely inconclusive, so future strategies for tackling these questions are discussed.
1	The authors study education and cognitive ability as predictors of female age at first birth (AFB), using monozygotic and dizygotic female twin pairs from the Middle-Aged Danish Twin survey. Using mediated regression, they replicate findings linking education ( and not cognitive ability) to AFB. But in a behavior genetic model, both relationships are absorbed within a latent variable measuring the shared family environment. Two interpretations are relevant. First, variance in AFB emerges from differences between families, not differences between sisters within the same family. Second, even in a natural laboratory sensitive to genetic variance in female fertility during demographic transition-the variance in AFB was non-genetic, located instead within the shared environment.
1	This study reports a cross-cultural test of Social Learning Theory using direct measures of social learning constructs and focusing on the causal structure implied by the theory. Overall, the results strongly confirm the main thrust of the theory. Prior criminal reinforcement and current crime-favorable definitions are highly related in all three contexts and both strongly predict self-projections of criminal behavior. In addition, effects of prior reinforcement on projected misconduct appear to be both direct and indirect (through crime-favorable definitions). Yet, the findings also indicate that the processes underlying direct effects of reinforcement on criminal probabilities may need to be explicated further. Moreover, some types of definitions may be more influential than other types. Finally, parts of the reinforcement process may be affected by socio-cultural contexts.
0	In December of 2005, Glamour magazine portrayed Mukhtar Mai, a Pakistani gang rape victim cum international sensation, as “woman of the year.”  Throughout 2004 and 2005, as Mai’s story surfaced in the Western world and in transnational media, she was hailed as the beacon for women’s rights in the Muslim world. Using semiotics and discourse analysis, I interrogate the discursive chain of events that make Mukhtar Mai, a contemporary human rights subject, into a metaphor for freedom and oppression of Pakistani women. Through a trenchant rereading of this sensationalized human rights case, I hope to show how human rights discourses are bound to the highly specific and deeply strategic politics of this contemporary moment – a moment that fixates, fetishizes, and fantasizes about the neocolonial Muslim woman subject. More specifically, I interrogate the production of Mai as the symbolic victory of the women’s rights as human rights narrative and how this victory relies on specific visualities of the female body. In examining Mai as a metaphoric site of freedom and oppression, I interrogate both human rights discourses that co-opt feminism with developmental discourses and imperial/neocolonial discourses that rely on particular Real fantasies of the “other.” The images and discourses of Mai demonstrate that neoliberal globalization, human rights rhetoric, and the war-on-terror shape the possibilities of women's subjectivities and make impossible, or at the very least, obfuscate the radical resistance of Pakistani feminists.
1	This study examines how patterns of racial and ethnic segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas vary by household structure. Specifically, using tract-level summary files from the 2000 decennial census, we estimated levels of metropolitan segregation for different racial and ethnic groups by household composition and poverty status. We find that when using the dissimilarity index, white households with children, and especially poor ones, are more segregated from black, Hispanic, and Asian households than are white households as a whole. Results from the interaction index provide complimentary information. In large part because nonpoor white married-couple households are more numerous than other groups in most metropolitan areas, Such households tend to have relatively less interaction with other racial and ethnic groups, and black and Hispanic households in particular. In contrast, minority group members often live in neighborhoods with a high proportion of non-Hispanic white households. Among all three minority group families with children, nonpoor married householders had the highest levels of interaction with whites. These results show that household structure shapes racial and ethnic residential patterns in U.S. metropolitan areas. 
1	The migration of millions of southerners out of the South between 1910 and 1970 is largely attributed to economic and social push factors in the South, combined with pull factors in other regions of the country. Researchers generally find that participants in this migration were positively selected from their region of origin, in terms of educational attainment and urban status, and that they fared relatively well in their destinations. To fully measure the migrants' success, however, a comparison with those who remained in the South is necessary. This article uses data from the U.S. Census to compare migrants who left the South with their southern contemporaries who stayed behind, both those who moved within the South and the sedentary population. The findings indicate that migrants who left the South did not benefit appreciably in terms of employment status, income, or occupational status. In fact, inter-regional migrants often fared worse than did southerners who moved within the South or those who remained sedentary. These results contradict conventional wisdom regarding the benefits of exiting the South and suggest the need for a revisionist interpretation of the experiences of those who left.
0	This paper critiques Frank's presentation of 5,000 years of the world system as failing to adequately differentiate it as a cultural and institutional order from preceding civilizations. Relying on the concept of cultural ansili, or core values, of Marimba Ani, and the work of Cheikh Anta Diop, as well as the work of feminist scholars, it is argued that the world-system is a European system distinguished by its sacred values of private property and dualistic divisions of humanity, manifest particularly in patriarchal systems of the north versus matriarchal systems of the south.
1	"This article analyzes how Central American immigrants in tenuous legal statuses experience current immigration laws. Based on ethnographic observations and over 200 interviews conducted between 1998 and 2010 with immigrants in Los Angeles and Phoenix and individuals in sending communities, this study reveals how the convergence and implementation of immigration and criminal law constitute forms of violence. Drawing on theories of structural and symbolic violence, the authors use the analytic category ""legal violence"" to capture the normalized but cumulatively injurious effects of the law. The analysis focuses on three central and interrelated areas of immigrants' lives-work, family, and school-to expose how the criminalization of immigrants at the federal, state, and local levels is not only exclusionary but also generates violent effects for individual immigrants and their families, affecting everyday lives and long-term incorporation processes."
0	This article reviews literature on the coming-out process for gay men in general and gay black men in particular.  The article examines how gay men come to accept their homosexuality and some of the factors that influence, or prohibit gay black men from coming-out.  Although there is no consensus on one way that gay men come to accept their homosexuality, there is largely agreement among scholars that the coming-out process happens in stages.  I propose that with current changes in societal acceptance of homosexuality, further research be done to determine how and if the coming-out process for gay black men has become easier and if the stages have changed.  In addition, further research is needed to study the time in which gay black men take to go from realizing their same-sex attraction to fully coming-out as gay men.
1	"This article explores how race and color labels are used to describe people in an Afro-Peruvian community. This article is based on analyses of 88 interviews and 18 months of fieldwork in an African-descended community in Peru. The analyses of these data reveal that, if we consider race and color to be conceptually distinct, there is no ""mulatto escape hatch,"" no social or cultural whitening, and no continuum of racial categories in the black Peruvian community under study. This article considers the implications of drawing a conceptual distinction between race and color for research on racial classifications in Latin America."
1	Power is a core theoretical construct in the field with amazing utility across substantive areas, levels of analysis and methodologies. Yet, its use along with associated assumptions - assumptions surrounding constraint vs. action and specifically organizational structure and rationality - remain problematic. In this article, and following an overview of important divides on the topic, I develop a dynamic relational theory of power. My framework, which builds on several strands of literature and my own in-depth investigations of workplace discrimination, challenges prevailing top-down conceptions of bureaucratic organizational constraint and rationality (derived from Weber). It also makes explicit the constitutive interplay of structure, culture and action, and provides significant insight into the relational nature of power. Relational, in these regards, entails often-assumed interpersonal interactions but also the capacities of actors to invoke structure (and thus leverage) and legitimate inequality through a two-pronged process of symbolic vilification and amplification. Contemporary bureaucracy and its structural and cultural foundations can provide the leverage for doing so and in a manner whereby hierarchical projects surrounding race, sex, age and social class are systematically reified.
0	We examine the impact of union membership on civic and political participation in the United States.  We discuss the organizational and institutional context that leads unions to mobilize their members and discuss the mechanisms.  We expect union membership to bolster political and civic participation, especially on electoral and collective action outcomes.  We further argue that union membership effects will be strongest for low-SES individuals.  Regression analyses of three nationally representative datasets find that union membership is associated with many forms of political activity, including voting, participating in protests, joining voluntary associations, and donating money to political campaigns.  We do not find effects on outcomes far removed from union agendas, such as general volunteering and charitable activities.  We observe that the impact of unions on political participation is often stronger for low-SES individuals, suggesting that unions provide an entre into civic life for people otherwise unlikely to have political access.  We discuss these findings in light of the secular decline of organized labor in the United States.
1	The value-in-diversity perspective argues that a diverse workforce, relative to a homogeneous one, is generally beneficial for business, including but not limited to corporate profits and earnings. This is in contrast to other accounts that view diversity as either nonconsequential to business success or actually detrimental by creating conflict, undermining cohesion, and thus decreasing productivity. Using data from the 1996 to 1997 National Organizations Survey, a national sample of for-profit business organizations, this article tests eight hypotheses derived from the value-in-diversity thesis. The results support seven of these hypotheses: racial diversity is associated with increased sales revenue, more customers, greater market share, and greater relative profits. Gender diversity is associated with increased sales revenue, more customers, and greater relative profits. I discuss the implications of these findings relative to alternative views of diversity in the workplace.
0	Using the example of antidepressant clinical trials with children, we present a framework to examine the issue of research integrity as a consequence of a complex dynamic involving stakeholders within the public and private sectors. Our premise is that lapses in research integrity are shaped by different understandings of what constitutes ethical handling of research results and are a consequence of the way that boundaries between stakeholder domains are constructed and reconstructed as actors invoke the cultural context. The cultural context unique to each stakeholder domain reflects the interests of that domain and embodies the logic guiding interpretations of ethical guidelines shaping the perception, interpretation, and dissemination of evidence. As actors from several domains participate in data disclosure interchanges surrounding, competing logics operate to increase the range of possible explanations that can be applied. Actors within each domain invoke strategies to select and prioritize certain explanations over others and to manage the dissemination of data.  Although stakeholder group actions are guided by good intentions, domain cultural context can lead to unintentional lapses in integrity. An historically situated analysis of research integrity plays a critical role in the development of policies to standardize the interpretation and dissemination of clinical trials data.
0	This paper addresses Grusky and Sorensons (1998) challenge to salvage class analysis by investigating differences between the industrial and postindustrial class structures. In contrast to occupational-based models of class, I employ a more Marxist model based around the exploitation of rent-generating class resources. Beginning from the product characteristics framework, I develop hypotheses about changes in the exploitative value of class resources as the US economy turns from goods production to service production. Empirical analyses compare national-level data from the 1960 PUMS and the 2001 CPS to investigate shifts in the class structure during this period. Results demonstrate that while traditional class relations remain salient, the class structure has nonetheless been altered. Income attainment becomes less dependent on the traditional owner/worker schism, but exploitation becomes increasingly dependent. Classes with authority assets become less likely to exploit, while skill resources become a more potent form of exploitation. Professionalization, unionization, and government employment all prove to be additional resources around which the class structure is built. These class resources prove particularly critical in their capacity to shelter groups of workers from the yoke of exploitation.
0	Over the last two decades Argentina experienced a cultural and political sea change. Ethnicity gained importance in political activism and state policies, and became a dominant feature in public discourse. The 1994 Constitution defined Argentina as a multiethnic nation and granted special rights to indigenous citizens. This paper explores the dynamics and implications of recent ethnic mobilization through a comparative analysis of the Mbya-Guaraní in Misiones and the Diaguita-Calchaquí in Tucumán, two indigenous groups from very distinct geographical and economical contexts, and with very different histories of engaging larger society.  In a first step we examine the relationship between transnational dynamics, state action, and indigenous land struggles. A historical analysis of ethnic mobilization in these two groups allows pinpointing the global, national, and local factors involved in enabling indigenous land struggles. In a second step this paper explores the consequences of land struggles for the experience of poverty among local indigenous communities in Argentina. While research on indigenous movements in Latin America has become a virtual growth industry over, we still know relatively little about the actual impact of ethnic mobilization on the experience of poverty and inequality.
0	This paper aims to explore the questions of legality and dictatorship as demonstrated in the Philippine case under the regime of Ferdinand Marcos. Focusing on the events of 1972 to 1973, this paper specifically questions the legal basis of the martial law as implemented by Marcos and how the presidential emergency power was further utilized to establish a regime that was contrary to the principles that a democratic constitution aims to purport.  I examine the basis for the proclamation of martial law and the legal maneuverings employed by Marcos to usurp power and how this power was also used to establish and implement a new constitution under his dictatorship.  I also examine the legality of this constitution which was drafted and promulgated under martial law.  Overall, this paper looks at how legality can pave the path for a dictatorship in a constitutional democracy using the Philippine case.
1	This paper examines the outcomes of individual abuse claims filed against states under the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as decided by the Human Rights Committee (HRC). Results from selection models that account for a country's initial decision to join the Optional Protocol and an individual's subsequent decision to file a complaint under it show that the substantive nature of complaints were more determinative of HRC outcomes than were country-level characteristics. Claims relating to due process rights, civil liberties, and political freedoms most often resulted in violations, whereas claims pertaining to discrimination, suffrage rights, and the rights of women and children were much less successful. Only two country-level characteristics robustly affected HRC outcomes, net of rights claims: democratizing countries were found in violation at higher rates than were other countries, while violation rates declined as a function of aggregate wealth. 
1	How do Latino immigrants in the United States understand existing racial categories? And how does the existing U.S. racial order influence this understanding? Using data from the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), our analysis points to changes in how the U.S. racial order might operate in the future. We find that most Latino immigrants recognize the advantages of a White racial designation when asked to self-identify, but wider society is not often accepting of this White expansion. Our findings suggest that relatively darker-skinned Latino immigrants experience skin-color-based discrimination in the realm of annual income. Furthermore, Latinos who are most integrated into the United States are the most likely to opt out of the existing U.S. racial categorization scheme. We predict that a racial boundary is forming around some Latino immigrants: those with darker skin and those who have more experience in the U.S. racial stratification system.
1	I argue that economic globalization, indicated by the tremendous rise in world foreign direct investment (FDI) in recent decades, is not driven simply by investor considerations of economic risk and return, but is significantly shaped by the construction of demand for foreign capital by receiving states. States signal this demand through the levels of formal and substantive legitimacy they grant to FDI They institutionalize globalization in formal rule as a normatively desirable development strategy. States substantiate this commitment by providing domestic and foreign actors with ideational and organizational resources to facilitate FDI To illustrate this argument, I use the case of Central and Eastern Europe, which was large v closed to global capital before the collapse of Communism. Analyses of quantitative and qualitative data show that substantive legitimacy granted to FDI by host states, more than formal regulations, determined the size of foreign capital flows into postsocialist countries in the first decade of market reform. These findings point to social foundations of macroeconomic trends beyond the re instrumental considerations of risk and return privileged in previous research.
0	Using data collected in Chongqing Municipality (formerly a part of Sichuan) from 746 rural households, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate whether or not the economic well-being of rural households was improved by having member(s) who are migrant workers in cities or by the remittances migrants sent home.  A total of seven indicators of household economic well-being are considered. The variations among rural households in economic well-being are explained using independent variables that differentiate migrant workers and their households.  Because we used well-being indicators that are measured at different levels, we conducted multiple regression, logistic regression, and cumulative logistic regression analyses depending on the level at which a particular outcome variable was measured.  Although we failed to find the anticipated positive association between our key independent variables and economic well-being, our analysis identified several factors that are unique to Chinas transforming economy and stratification order which successfully predict migrant remittances and economic well-being of Chinas rural households.
0	This paper explores why countries differ in the timing of adopting neoliberal reform in their telecommunication industry in 18 affluent democracies between 1982 and 2002. Using the discrete-time event history analysis, it examines the effects on liberalization in telecommunications of economic globalization, economic interests, sector performance, domestic political institutions, and political party power. Liberalization is defined as introducing market competition in a long-distance telephone market. The study finds that economic interests and right party power respectively increases the adoption of neoliberal reform. However, the effects of these factors are significantly moderated during the 1990s, compared to the 1980s. The effects of domestic political institutions, leftist party power, and economic globalization are not supported.
0	In this study, I focus on the Moroccan womens movement case to reform the Moudawana or Islamic Family Law.  I draw from the political opportunity and social movement literature to analyze the discursive means by which Conservatives and Islamists organized opposition to the feminist activists reform efforts on the basis of Islamic patriarchy. These discourses had considerable social institutional strength and cultural resonance in the Moroccan public. I demonstrate how Moroccan womens rights activists neutralized the seemingly fixed religious opposition to law reform and re-appropriated religious discourses, shaping an opportunity for the movement. This process of breaking through constraints in the political opportunity structure, I suggest denotes the permeability of constraints. I elaborate the theory of permeable constraints highlighting (a) the ways that Moroccan womens rights activists strategically re-interpreted the political opportunity structure and (b) how activists transcended religious barriers opposing Islamic law reform. The analysis finds that Moroccan activists interpretation of religious constraints as potentially permeable led them to strategize both within religious and secular frameworks, drawing from religious principles of re-interpretation through ijtihad, and international human rights principles. The activists analysis of obstacles as permeable resulted in opportunities for shifting the discourse and the tide of Moudawana reform.
0	"The presentation will discuss the pros and cons of having students use the Internet to study social problems. This is a strategy that sometimes works beautifully, but sometimes it presents problems. For example, one minor but interesting problem is that there are quite a few rock bands and punk bands who take their names from social problems. So, when students search for information on problems like ""deadbeat dads"" they get websites for the band known as the Deadbeat Dads. Corporate Greed is another band that students have come across in their Internet searches. But while this is an annoying--if humorous--problem, it could also work in reverse: i.e., young people searching for information on their favorite bands, may end up linking to websites of community-based organizations and other nonprofits working to solve social problems. Another issue that arises in the class is that some students seem to have difficulty recognizing that texts and copy they encounter on the Internet is written by *somebody* and that it is not OK to simply cut and paste this text into one's own work. I call this problem inadvertent or ""virtual"" plagiarism. I will suggest some strategies for avoiding this problem."
1	This investigation assesses the relationships between racial threat and partisan dominance in state legislatures with tests of interactive hypotheses. The findings show that historically contingent expectations derived from racial threat theory, Republican law and order campaign appeals, and fundamentalist strength account for Republican strength in the legislatures. Two-way fixed-effects estimates based on pooled time-series analyses of 799 state-years in the post-civil rights era show that the percentage of Republicans in the state legislatures grew after increases in African American presence and the violent crime rates. The combined effects of a growth in African American and fundamentalist populations also account for increased Republican seats in these bodies. Statements by Republican campaign officials on how they deliberately used mass resentments against minorities to gain votes provide evidence about the intervening links between minority threat, the menace posed by high violent crime rates, and increased Republican strength in the state legislatures.

1	This study extends research on the consequences of mass imprisonment and the causes of children's behavioral problems by considering the effects of paternal incarceration on children's physical aggression at age 5 using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study Results suggest that paternal incarceration is associated with increased physical aggression for boys, and that effects are concentrated among boys whose fathers were neither Incarcerated for a violent offense nor abusive to the boys' mother Results also suggest that paternal incarceration may decrease girls physical aggression, although this finding is not robust Taken together, results imply that mass imprisonment may contribute to a system of stratification in which crime and incarceration are passed down from fathers to sons (but not daughters)
1	"While individuals returning from prison face many barriers to successful re-entry, among the most serious are the challenges they face in securing housing. Housing has long been recognized as a prerequisite for stable employment, access to social services, and other aspects of individual and family functioning. The formerly incarcerated face several administrative and de facto restrictions on their housing options; however, little is known about the unique instabilities that they face. We use a longitudinal survey of urban families to examine housing insecurity among nearly 3000 urban men, including over 1000 with incarceration histories. We find that men recently incarcerated face greater housing insecurity, including both serious hardships such as homelessness, and precursors to homelessness such as residential turnover and relying on others for housing expenses. Their increased risk is tied both to diminished annual earnings and other factors, including, potentially, evictions from public housing supported by Federal ""one-strike"" policies. "
0	This qualitative study explores the institutional mechanisms of the educational system in India that inhibit the socio-economic mobility of students from tribal populations. This study analyzes the participation of tribal students in the Indian education system from the socio-economic and cultural reproduction perspectives. The findings indicate that participation in the Indian education system promotes cultural dissonance among tribal students due, in part, to the fact that the Indian education system makes little attempt to address the cultural specificities of tribal students in the design of educational policies. This promotes a poor educational performance by tribal students, which aids in the formation of a negative self-image. The problem is further complicated by the un-empathetic attitudes and beliefs of teachers and the nature of the development policies designed by educational planners.  The study used a non-experimental, cross-sectional research design with the main tools of data collection being observation and personal interviews. Personal interviews were conducted with tribal students, graduates, parents, teachers, and principals of tribal schools. The study was conducted on the Santal, Birhor, Kharia and Lodha tribes located in Bankura, Birbhum, Puruliya, and Paschim Medinipur districts of the state of West Bengal in India.
1	Nativity differences in youths' health in the United States are striking the children of foreign-born parents often have healthier outcomes than those of native-born parents. However, very little is known about how immigrant-native differences evolve within the same individuals over time, or about life cycle aspects of the health-related integration of youth with migration backgrounds. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I examine nativity differences in trajectories of weight gain during adolescence and early adulthood, as well as the degree to which temporal patterns are stratified by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. I examine whether nativity differences converge, diverge or remain stable over time, and whether patterns are socially stratified within and across nativity groups. I find that first-generation adolescents begin at a lower weight than their third generation peers and gain weight at a significantly slower pace, resulting in meaningful differences by early adulthood. More complex examination of the relationship between nativity and weight gain reveals additional differences by ethnicity: the foreign-born advantage over time does not extend as strongly to Hispanic adolescents. The findings demonstrate how the health-related integration of foreign-born youth is tied to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic circumstances, and suggest the need to examine the ways in which social circumstances and health change together. 
1	Several studies examine biblical literalism to categorize Christian denominations and predict attitudes and behaviors. Yet, few studies have identified the predictors of literalist orientations. In this study, we use structuration theory and gender theory to develop hypotheses concerning gender differences in literalist ideologies based on the degree of organizational patriarchy among religious traditions. Analyses using two national data sets demonstrate that women are relatively more inclined than men to embrace a literalist ideology in patriarchal religious organizations than in mainline organizations. We argue that a literalist ideology provides a compensatory schema to conservative Protestant women, who are generally denied access to organizational resources, especially positions of leadership and authority, in such organizations. We conclude by identifying the implications of our findings for research on gender, religion and patriarchal organizations.
0	In this paper three models accounting for the management of danger over long periods were used to analyze the data from interviews and observation assessing researchers’ perceptions of risk taking in a chemical engineering lab. Of particular interest is how open and accurate respondents’ descriptions of their experience of danger in the lab are. Another central concern is the role that institutional influences play and how these are reinforced or attenuated by the lead researcher. The conclusion is that respondents genuinely have low level of concern for safety in this lab, and that the autonomy these researchers enjoy in this lab supports their professional development, but also promotes a tendency for them to adjust institutional messages concerning routine precautions according to their own judgment of safety needs.
0	The city of São Paulo is seen by many as a global city, given the sheer size of its population and economy and most importantly its role in the various world networks of commerce and culture. In recent years, the diffusion of communication technologies among its population, and especially among the young, has opened up participation in global networks of information for individual citizens. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with young students, conducted in centrally located public cultural centers in São Paulo, this paper explores the ways in which this participation takes place, the cultural and social forms serving as a venue for it and the meaning attached to it by its participants.
0	Giorgio Perlasca (1910-1992) is today the most famous Italian man among the ones who were awarded the honor of Righteous among the Nations for saving Jewish citizens during the second World War. However, his story was neglected for nearly fourty years and resurfaced only at the end of the 1980's. The paper investigates the reasons for this neglect, and analyzes the political use of Perlasca's figure in the recent Italian debate on shared memory. After taking into consideration the political and cultural reasons which generated forgetting about his story, the paper analyses the turning point in the reception of Perlasca, and the demise of his otherwise problematic fascist identity in favour of a new, humanitarian frame. The third section deals with the competitive use of his established reputation, and its role in reshaping discourse on public memory in recent Italian history.
1	The purpose of this research is to explain the variation in the utilization of drug therapy for the medical conditions of depression, high cholesterol, and hypertension between Hispanics. non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanics whites using Oaxaca-type decomposition analysis based on logit estimates. We find that almost the entire share of the utilization differences in drug therapy between blacks and whites can be explained by the differences in the coefficients of observable characteristics, while the sources of the utilization difference between the whites and Hispanics are split between the differences in the observable characteristics and the coefficient estimates. This result implies that strategies to improve racial and ethnic disparities need to be tailored to each group by focusing on the specific factors that are attributed to causing the disparity. 
1	We examine the effect of the race, age, and gender of victims of assault on the offenders' use of weapons and lethal intent. Evidence from the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) suggests that offenders are particularly likely to use guns against young black men-a three-way interaction - and to kill black males and young black adults. Black offenders respond more strongly to the victim's race than do white offenders. As a result of these effects, a violent incident between two young black men is about six times more likely to involve a gun than a violent incident between two young white men. We suggest that adversary effects, i.e., an offender's tactical response to the threat posed by adversaries, help explain why violence in black communities tends to be much more serious than violence in white communities.

1	Among those who use multiple regression or its offshoots, the dominant method of modeling an interaction effect of two independent variables oil a dependent variable is to include a product variable in a linear estimation equation. In this paper, I show how the coefficient for the product variable in these models depends on the causal mechanism that underlies the interaction effect. I also show that different causal mechanisms can imply the same estimation equation, which means that one cannot determine the causal mechanism underlying an interaction effect from the empirical results produced by the estimation equation. Social scientists typically lack the kind of theoretical knowledge required to specify Causal mechanisms for interaction effects, and researchers who do specify a mechanism, such as those who specify that contextual-level variables moderate the effects of individual-level variables but not vice versa, rarely justify their implicit claims. Although it is difficult to specify the causal mechanism underlying a particular interaction effect, I show that there are cases where it is possible to do so. 
0	Using data on hiring patterns drawn from a sample of baccalaureate-granting colleges and universities, this research examines contrasting predictions derived from social contact and group competition theories about the effects of organizational gender composition on group relations.  Our findings indicate that increases in the overall proportion of women faculty in an institution have a positive, curvilinear impact on the number of women hired, at both tenured and untenured levels, thus providing some support for a social contact approach.  However, we also find that increases in the proportion of women at tenured ranks have a negative, curvilinear relation to the rate of hiring of women for untenured positions, which we argue is consistent with the predictions of a group competition approach.  We discuss implications of this for further research on organizational demography.
0	This paper analyzes censal racial classification in three historical eras and then suggests how and why racial data collection may still be necessary.Early on in U.S. history, race recognition and rights were used to control people of color and to define their denial of rights. In the civil rights era, racial recognition again was used to fix recognition and race to those eligible for civil rights claims. Now, with the making multiple of racial categories, and making that multiplicity recognized, rights may become de-racialized and thus untraceable.
0	"Weber's oeuvre is still not well understood. Many scholars do not adequately take into account his implicit thesis concerning the oscillation of Patrimonial-prebendal and Patrimonial-feudal social structures. The thesis that Buddhist and Hindu conceptualizations concerning the structure of legitimate authority in the state can heuristically be considered in terms of an Ideal Type Model (ITM) that is correctly labeled ""Patrimonial-Prebendalism"" is not widely accepted. I have published on the topic, particularly with respect to Java and Bali, but as a Dutch-Canadian my work on Indonesia is not well known among sociologists in the United States. A comparative-historical sociology of religion that does not take into account Weber's ideas concerning Patrimonialism as an ITM may not pay enough attention to the way in which the theologies are deeply rooted in social structures. The situation in China during the T'ang Dynasty is better known to sociologists than the situation in the Indonesian archipelago, but the sociological structures of Buddhist Empires are similar. Indonesia today is not an Islamic state, although there are many Islamic people in Indonesia. The current secular state in Indonesia follows the principle of Pancasila, which includes as one of the five principles that five of the world religions are equally respected. But the Pancasila state has been dominated by pre-colonial Buddhist-Hindu ideas of centripetal power through military officials that were never significantly tampered with during most of the colonial era. Today Indonesia has changed significantly once again."
0	Our paper examines women's labor market trajectories and household income inequality in the US, Germany, and Britain. Using panel data we investigate the development of couples’ work careers and women’s earnings in the first five years following union formation, and we simulate income inequality under alternative assumptions about labor supply, marital stability and welfare state support for working families. We find that differences in institutional settings shape women’s careers: US women experience penalties for part-time work and labor market withdrawal, resulting in high levels of full-time participation after marriage and childbirth. In Britain, part-time employment rates among married women are higher than in the US.  Germans’ wages are protected by a credential-based occupational structure, wage-setting mechanisms that preclude sharp wage differentials for part-time work, and employment protections for women withdrawing temporarily following childbirth. Simulations of family income inequality suggest women’s labor force participation as an important component of country-level income inequality.
1	I examine whether the effect of parents' education on children's educational achievement and attainment varies by family structure and, if so, whether this can be explained by differential parenting practices. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, I find that as parents' education increases, children in single mother families experience a lower boost in their achievement test scores, likelihood of attending any post-secondary schooling, likelihood of completing a 4-year college degree, and years of completed schooling relative to children living with both biological parents. Differences in parents' educational expectations, intergenerational closure, and children's involvement in structured leisure activities partially explain these status transmission differences by family structure. The findings imply that, among children with highly educated parents, children of single mothers are less likely to be highly educated themselves relative to children who grow up with both biological parents. 
1	Despite the growing interest in union organizing, there has been little effort to systematically describe the organizing landscape in America today. Institutionalization, which is an increasingly important concept in social movement theory, provides the framework for differentiating between the two major organizing repertoires presently available to unions: the traditional National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification election and more recent organizing that avoids the election process. Evidence from a sample of 70 large local unions from 1990 to 2001 reveals that, although the certification election continues to be the preferred method of membership recruitment, non-NLRB organizing appears to be more effective, in terms of both victory rate and number of workers organized. The findings have implications for future research on labor unions and represent an important step toward an empirical understanding of processes of institutionalization within social movements generally.
1	The onset and escalation of alcohol consumption and romantic relationships are hallmarks of adolescence. Yet only recently have these domains jointly been the focus of sociological inquiry. We extend this literature by connecting alcohol use, dating, and peers to understand the diffusion of drinking behavior in school-based friendship networks. Drawing on Granovetter's classic concept of weak ties, we argue that adolescent romantic partners are likely to be network bridges, or liaisons, connecting daters to new peer contexts that, in turn, promote changes in individual drinking behaviors and allow these behaviors to spread across peer networks. Using longitudinal data of 449 couples from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate Actor-Partner Interdependence Models and identify unique contributions of partners' drinking, friends' drinking, and friends-of-partners' drinking to daters' own future binge drinking and drinking frequency. Findings support the liaison hypothesis and suggest that friends-of-partners' drinking have net associations with adolescent drinking patterns. Moreover, the coefficient for friends-of-partners' drinking is larger than the coefficient for one's own peers and generally immune to prior selection. Our findings suggest that romantic relationships are important mechanisms for understanding the diffusion of emergent problem behaviors in adolescent peer networks.
0	U.S. undergraduate engineering programs have performed poorly in producing engineering graduates who pursue careers in engineering. Organization theories provide competing perspectives as to whether and which organizations may be able to affect change in promoting engineering persistence. We report findings from a natural experiment in engineering education comparing two new and two established institutions aiming to promote persistence among its graduates.Neo-institutional theory emphasizes similarity among organizations, and suggests distinctive institutional effects are unlikely. Organizational ecology emphasizes variation by organization founding, and suggests distinctiveness is most likely in the smallest, newest school. We find that institutional effects are contingent on prior commitment to engineering. Across all students and among students who made a personal commitment to become an engineer prior to entering an engineering program, there were no school effects. Among those students who entered college uncertain of their engineering career plans, however, we find strong and consistent institutional effects  significantly more positive persistence outcomes from the newest and smallest engineering school. Our analysis supports the ecological view that newness aids the successful implementation of novel and innovative organizational practices, but that organizational member identity is an important modifier for these effects.
1	This article investigates the association between past lynchings (1882 to 193 0) and contemporary law enforcement responses to hate crimes in the United States. While prior research indicates a positive correlation between past levels of lynching and current social control practices against minority groups, we posit an inverse relationship for facets of social control that are protective of minorities. Specifically, we hypothesize that contemporary hate crime policing and prosecution will be less vigorous where lynching was more prevalent prior to 1930. Analyses show that levels of past lynching are associated with three outcome variables germane to hate crime policing and prosecution, but the effect of lynching is partly contingent on the presence of a minority group threat. That is, past lynching combined with a sizeable black population largely suppresses (1) police compliance with federal hate crime law, (2) police reports of hate crimes that target blacks, and in some analyses (3) the likelihood of prosecuting a hate crime case. Our findings have implications for research on law and intergroup conflict, historical continuity in the exercise of state social control, and theories that emphasize minority group threat.
1	Latin America is often used as a backdrop against which U.S. race relations are compared. Yet research on race in Latin America focuses almost exclusively on countries in the region with a large recognized presence of individuals of African descent such as Brazil. Racial categories in these countries are based on skin color distinctions along a black-white continuum. By contrast, the main socially recognized ethnic distinction in Indo-Latin American countries such as Mexico, between indigenous and non-indigenous residents, is not based primarily on phenotypical differences, but rather on cultural practices and language use. Many Mexicans today nevertheless express a preference for whiter skin and European features, even though no clear system of skin color categorization appears to exist. In this study, I use data from a nationally-representative panel survey of Mexican adults to examine the extent of skin-color-based social stratification in contemporary Mexico. Despite extreme ambiguity in skin color classification, I find considerable agreement among survey interviewers about who belongs to three skin color categories. The results also provide evidence of profound social stratification by skin color. Individuals with darker skin tone have significantly lower levels of educational attainment and occupational status, and they are more likely to live in poverty and less likely to be affluent, even after controlling for other individual characteristics.
0	"There is strong disagreement among scholars and the general public about prostitution and the issues surrounding it.  The controversy appears to reflect larger, more fundamental conflicts within our culture.  While these larger ""cultural oppositions"" are clearly visible in conflicts between different groups and constituencies, I argue that these oppositions are also present within individuals, who may, at any given time, hold contradictory definitions and understandings.  Qualitative written accounts drawn from a web-based network of men who patronize prostitutes are analyzed to evaluate the degree of inconsistency in their definitions of prostitution. The accounts suggest that customers borrow from a range of cultural understandings of prostitution, depending upon which are most useful to them and relevant to the situation. I argue that customers have a vested interest in being unaware of these inconsistencies."
1	Many existing studies have demonstrated the earnings disadvantage of immigrants in U.S. labor market. When examining the mechanism of such disadvantage, previous research has pointed to the factor of lower human capital as a portion of immigrants completed their education before immigration. This study builds on the previous research and further investigates both place of college and where they completed education on the earnings among immigrant scientists and engineers. In addition to the human capital, this study captures factors pertaining to acculturation. Using data from Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), I divide the immigrant scientists and engineers into fully foreign-educated, fully U.S.-educated and mixed foreign- and U.S.-educated groups. These categories are regressed against the native-born in a full sample and subsamples of men and women, respectively. The full-sample analysis shows that immigrant scientists and engineers who have received their college education abroad are at an earnings disadvantage, regardless of whether they completed their higher degrees in or outside the United States. However, their earnings can rise faster than their native-born peers if they completed their education in the United States. The results suggest that attending college and/or pre-college in U.S. plays a more substantial role in closing the earnings gap between immigrants and non-immigrants among scientists and engineers. Gender-specific analyses reveal that the earnings gap between immigrants and native-born women is narrower than that between their male counterparts, showing gender may play a more salient role in earnings disadvantage than immigrant status. 
0	"The underlying idea behind this essay is that the textual and civilizational representations used by Islamists and religious authorities we cover is a product of a global discursive exchange that is expressive of our very present and modern world, of the here and now. To represent the Islamists as “clinging” to a “real” past entity called ""Islamic civilization"" requires an Orientalist lens that suppresses the dialogical—and very immediate—nature of the actual encounter. The background methodology of my study is highly influenced by Immanuel Wallerstein’s world-systems analysis and Edward Said’s notion of a “contrapuntal imagination” in which the researcher remains aware of the dialogical nature in which culture’s are narrated and produced. What I find most productive about the methodologies these two provide is that they allow us to apply a new lens in which we could see the dialogical processes at work in which phenomena like “civilizations,” religions, and identities do not contain their own temporal and spatial bodies but are instead in constant motion with Others. With this methodology in mind, I hope to show that when Islamists produce categories of gender or “tradition,” they are doing it through a very modern lens, not through a time-immemorial culture that in some mystical way precedes our very present reality."

0	As product of the Healthy Youth/Healthy Regions study (HYHR), a cross-sector, multidisciplinary analysis of the relationship between youth well-being and geographic disparities in the Sacramento region of California, this paper will draw on data from multiple methodologies in order both identify the level of regional youth civic engagement, broadly defined, as well as understand the individual and contextual factors affecting these patterns of engagement. In particular, we examine the influence of community racial and ethnic make-up on the likelihood of Latino youth to engage civically, as a possible form of collective action. The Sacramento region, with its high level of racial and ethnic diversity, is an excellent case study for such an analysis. Indeed, in 2002 the city of Sacramento itself was deemed by The Harvard Civil Rights Project, the country’s most integrated city. Preliminary HYHR civic engagement data show a high variation in youth participation (i.e. voting, volunteerism) across counties within the Sacramento region. This uneven youth involvement is particularly troubling in light of the regional disparities in education, workforce, and health outcomes, also identified by the study. Holding the assumption that civic engagement is an appropriate and potentially effective means toward addressing disparities in youth outcomes, this paper’s focused analysis seeks to understand community factors involved in the choice by youth to engage civically, on behalf of the their own needs, within the HYHR region. Key to this analysis is understanding the interplay of such efforts with the resources and civic attitudes held by youth.
0	Prior research has frequently drawn parallels between two forms of criminal and often violent behavior: hate crimes and terrorism. Yet key differences between the two behaviors may be underappreciated in extant work. Terrorism is often an 'upward crime,' involving a perpetrator of lower social standing than the targeted group. By contrast, hate crimes are disproportionately 'downward crimes,' usually entailing perpetrators belonging to the majority or powerful group in society and minority group victims. The latter difference implies that hate crimes and terrorism are more akin to distant relatives than close cousins. These divergent perspectives provide a backdrop for the present research, which empirically investigates the association between hate crimes and terrorism. In doing so we contribute to prior work on hate crimes and terrorism by emphasizing the temporal association between these behaviors and by empirically investigating the potential for one kind of violent event to trigger another kind of violence. Time-series analyses of weekly and daily data on terrorism and hate crimes committed in the United States between 1992 and 2008 reveal three primary conclusions. First, we find no evidence to suggest that hate crimes are a precursor to future terrorism. Second, hate crimes are often perpetrated in response to terrorist acts. Third, the latter association is particularly strong for hate crimes perpetrated against minority groups after a non-right wing terrorist attack, particularly attacks on symbols of core American ideals, indicating that some hate crimes may essentially constitute expressions of retaliation.
0	If discrimination involves the perception of unequal treatment, and language shapes perception, then can bilingual skills moderate the negative effects of of discrimination, a major stressor often experienced by racial/ethnic minority youths?  Latent class analysis is used to categorize fluent English speakers into three categories of native language proficiency: fluent bilingual, native speaker bilingual (i.e., can speak but cannot read or write ones native language), and English dominant.  The effect of discrimination on self-esteem among fluent bilingual and native speaker bilingual youths is weaker compared to English dominant youths of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds.  A similar pattern is found for depression outcome among youths with higher depression levels prior to the incident of discrimination.  Two explanations are proposed for the buffering effects of bilingual skills.
1	It is commonly argued that social mobility rates are influenced by economic and political conditions. Nevertheless, research on this issue has tended to be hindered by two limitations that make it difficult to draw strong conclusions about contextual effects: (1) seldom have country-level and individual-level influences been tested simultaneously, and (2) only rarely have data more recent than the 1970s been employed. We improve on previous research by employing multilevel models fitted to relatively recent survey data collected from 20 modern societies by the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and national-level characteristics derived from various official sources. Our findings demonstrate systematic cross-national variation in the association between the occupational status of respondents and their fathers. Consistent with the industrialization thesis, this variation is positively associated with per-capita GDP, suggesting that more affluent nations are characterized by more open and fluid stratification structures. Our results also suggest the importance of political regimes and migration for social mobility. In contrast, economic inequality appears to explain very little of the cross-national variation in mobility rates. 
1	This article examines the interplay of culture, cognition, and social networks in organizations with norms that emphasize cross-boundary collaboration. In such settings, social desirability concerns can induce a disparity between how people view themselves in conscious (i.e., deliberative) versus less conscious (i.e., automatic) cognition. These differences have implications for the resulting pattern of intra-organizational collaborative ties. Based on a laboratory study and field data from a biotechnology firm, we find that (1) people consciously report more positive views of themselves as collaborative actors than they appear to hold in less conscious cognition; (2) less conscious collaborative-independent self-views are associated with the choice to enlist organizationally distant colleagues in collaboration; and (3) these self-views are also associated with a person's likelihood of being successfully enlisted by organizationally distant colleagues (i.e., of supporting these colleagues in collaboration). By contrast, consciously reported collaborative-independent self-views are not associated with these choices. This study contributes to our understanding of how culture is internalized in individual cognition and how self-related cognition is linked to social structure through collaboration. It also demonstrates the limits of self-reports in settings with strong normative pressures and represents a novel integration of methods from cognitive psychology and network analysis.
1	Bridging the areas of political-economic sociology, the sociology of agriculture and environmental sociology, this study tests two hypotheses derived from a refined theory of foreign investment dependence. The hypotheses state that pesticide and fertilizer use intensity in less-developed countries are both positively associated with foreign investment dependence in the primary sector. The use of such inputs in agriculture production is known to contribute to a variety of human health and environmental problems. Findings for random effects and static score panel regression analyses of 35 less-developed countries confirm the hypotheses, and point to the sociological relevance in assessing the potential social and environmental impacts of both the transnational organization and the relative scale of production in different sectors.
1	The educational expectations of 10th-graders have dramatically increased from 1980 to 2002. Their rise is attributable in part to the changing educational composition of students' parents and related to the educational profiles of their expected occupations. Students whose parents have gone to college are more likely to attend college themselves, and students expect occupations that are more prestigious in 2002 than in 1980. The educational requirements of particular occupation categories have risen only slightly. These analyses also reveal that educational expectations in recent cohorts are more loosely linked to social background and occupational plans than they were in 1980. The declining importance of parents' background and the decoupling of educational and occupational plans, in addition to a strong and significant effect of cohort on educational expectations, suggest that the expectation of four-year college attainment is indeed becoming the norm.

0	Professional social movement organizations (SMOs) can influence the trajectory of a social movement as well as alter social, political, and cultural conditions more broadly. However, little is known about what leads SMOs to work on specific campaign projects and problems. Drawing from organization and social movement theory, and using an interpretive approach, this study investigates the selection of campaign problems in professional environmental organizations. The findings suggest that SMOs develop routine patterns of activism that form solutions that are present even before problems emerge. With a mobilization routine in place, it appears that SMOs rely on programmatic assessments to determine whether their solution is an appropriate means for addressing a given problem. This analysis demonstrates that structural explanations of SMO mobilization are incomplete and should be expanded to account for the internal processes that take place within these organizations.
0	Empirical studies of religions role in society, especially those focused on individuals and employing survey data analyses, conceptualize and measure religiosity as unidimensional, ranging from high to low on a single measure or a summary of multiple measures.  Scholars operating from a perspective of lived religion criticize this widespread approach for (1) not capturing the complicated reality and seeming inchoateness of individuals religiosity and (2) relying too heavily on institutionally prescribed beliefs and practices (primarily those of Evangelical Christianity) as benchmarks.  Although the preferred method for understanding religiosity as individuals live it has been ethnographic observation and interviewing, we argue that another tool with which to apply this perspective in large and representative populations is the person-oriented approach of Latent Class Analysis.  Using twelve indicators of various dimensions of religiosity measured in the first wave of the National Study of Youth and Religions telephone survey, we reveal five latent classes of religiosity among adolescents in the United States.  Further, we show the various social and demographic characteristics related to class membership. Our findings reveal the added value of a person-centered approach to analyzing shapes and forms of religiosity as lived by adolescents in the United States.
1	Earnings inequality has grown in recent decades in the United States, yet research investigating the motherhood wage penalty has not fully considered how the penalty itself, and the mechanisms producing it, may vary among low-wage, middle-wage, and high-wage workers. Pooling data from the 1979 to 2004 waves of the NLSY and using simultaneous quantile regression methods with fixed effects, we test whether the size of the motherhood penalty differs across the distribution of white women's earnings, and whether the mechanisms explaining this penalty vary by earnings level. Results show that having children inflicts the largest penalty on low-wage women, proportionately, although a significant motherhood penalty persists at all earnings levels. We also find that the mechanisms creating the motherhood penalty vary by earnings level. Family resources, work effort, and compensating differentials account for a greater portion of the penalty among low earners. Among highly paid women, by contrast, the motherhood penalty is significantly smaller and largely explained by lost human capital due to childbearing. Our findings show that estimates of average motherhood penalties obscure the compounded disadvantage mothers face at the bottom of the earnings distribution, as well as differences in the type and strength of mechanisms that produce the penalty.
0	At the turn of the 20th century, sociology was in a very fluid state.  Many sociologists vied simultaneously to define the fielld, establish their professional lives and promote social justice.  Women were especially marginalized in this endeavor.  In this paper, I examine the experiences of community-based sociologists Caroline Bartlett Crane and Jane Addams as they debated the meaning of peace and patriotism in the run up to World War I.  Their individual paths to peace reflect the social tensions of the period and illuminate current concerns regarding the proper balance between peace and partirotism in the pursuit of justice.

1	"In the United States, rhetoric in support of the Iraq War often focuses on discourses of patriotism and supporting the troops. These discourses hold enormous sway over the American public because of the discursive legacies of the Vietnam War and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In response, members of the peace movement who are veterans, soldiers, and military families stress their military identities during activism. These individuals have organized as an important branch of the U.S. antiwar movement that challenges the pro-war framing of patriotism and troop support by strategically deploying ""oppositional identities."" The oppositional identity strategy involves highlighting the activism of individuals who many would assume would be part of the movement's opposition. In an effort to assert credibility and support their frames, activists assert this novel and seemingly contradictory identity. through organizational affiliation, rhetoric, clothing, mannerisms, and symbols."
0	The international donor community portrays the private sector as the vanguard of a market revolution in the developing world, and therefore speaks of creating capitalists, empowering entrepreneurs, and even countering terror with trade.  The proposed paper therefore departs from a puzzling feature of the contemporary sociology of development.  While mainstream economists and policymakers have at long last embraced the idea, and at times even the idiom, of the bourgeois revolution, their criticsincluding a number of well-known sociologistshave all but abandoned the national bourgeoisie as a valid object of inquiry.  Why have sociologists ceded the national bourgeoisie to the economists?  I trace the answer to modern sociologys at times unconscious abandonment of the classical sociological tradition in the mid-twentieth century and call for the analytical resurrection of the third leg of the triple alliance of multinational, state, and local capital described by Peter Evans a quarter of a century ago.
1	We study trends in educational homogamy at six boundaries in the educational structure of 10 East-Asian societies and explain its variation using explanatory variables at the country, cohort and boundary level. Educational homogamy was higher at the higher boundaries in the educational structure. Since the 1950s it decreased at all but the lowest boundaries, indicating convergence to a relatively low level of homogamy. Educational homogamy is lower in societies that are more modern, have higher female employment and experienced less Confucian influence. Results support the general openness and the exclusivity hypothesis, which predict educational homogamy to decrease in modernizing societies and to be higher when the group of more highly educated is smaller. Findings suggest that the trend towards less educational homogamy is related to educational expansion.
0	In this paper, I examine the efforts of personal care workers to gain security through unionization and its impact on people with disabilities. I draw on a case study of the dominant model of service delivery in Ontario  delivery by non-profit organizations contracted to the government  using policy analysis and key informant interviews.  The paper is organized into three sections.  The first section describes the interpersonal and intermittent nature of personal care work, and the two vulnerable groups engaged in care work: racialized women and men as workers and people with disabilities as clients/consumers. Section two outlines the difficulties of organizing personal care workers under an industrial labour relations regime, including the need to establish than an organization, rather than an individual, is the employer and structural problems due to the fact that collective bargaining legislation is based on the norm of a direct and continuous, employment relationship with one employer where the work is performed at a single, formal worksite.  Moving to the case study, section three focuses on how part-time, shift and on-call workers have won fair wages, extended benefits and the ability to enforce fair labour standards by joining Local 40 of the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) yet highlights how the industrial labor relations regime does not fit well with the demands of people with disabilities for a more flexible delivery of services. This case illustrates the need for a new labour relations regime that can bring security with flexibility to both workers and clients/consumers.
1	A long-standing objective of friendship research is to identify the effects of personal preference and structural opportunity on intergroup friendship choice. Although past studies have used various methods to separate preference from opportunity, researchers have not yet systematically compared the properties and implications of these methods. This study puts forward a general framework for discrete choice, where choice probability is specified as proportional to the product of preference and opportunity. To implement this framework, the authors propose a modification to the conditional logit model for estimating preference parameters free from the influence of opportunity structure and then compare this approach to several alternative methods for separating preference and opportunity used in the friendship choice literature. As an empirical example, the authors test hypotheses of homophily and status asymmetry in friendship choice using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The example also demonstrates the approach of conducting a sensitivity analysis to examine how parameter estimates vary by specification of the opportunity structure.
1	This article tests three classical theoretical assumptions about the cause of nationalism. It does so by testing if elite discourse, or internal- and external threats have any impact on nationalist sentiments in Europe. Macro data from various sources is combined with attitudinal data from the International Social Survey Programme 2003 for 21 European countries. Ills concluded that the articulation of nationalism by political elites does not matter. Internal threats in the form of foreign-born population and language fractionalization affect nationalist sentiment negatively, i.e. nationalist sentiments are weaker in more heterogeneous countries. Finally, it is shown that external threats, in the form of loss of territory, have a positive impact on nationalist sentiments: people are more nationalist in countries that have a more recent loss of territory. 
0	This paper applies models for longitudinal count data characterized by an excess number of zeros. We discuss the zero-inflated Poisson regression model for longitudinal data in the context of growth curve modeling, in which the impact of covariates on initial counts and the rate of change over time in counts is the focus of inference. We describe basic growth curve models using a single outcome trajectory as well as a model in which two linked growth trajectories characterize a parallel growth process. We carry out an empirical application to assess the impact of changes in financial stress on smoking trajectories.
1	Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and three decennial US censuses are used to examine the influence of metropolitan-area characteristics on black and white households' propensity to move into poor versus nonpoor neighborhoods. We find that a nontrivial portion of the variance in the odds of moving to a poor rather to a nonpoor neighborhood exists between metropolitan areas. Net of established individual-level predictors of inter-neighborhood migration, black and white households are more likely to move to a poor or extremely poor tract rather than to a nonpoor tract in metropolitan areas containing many poor neighborhoods and a paucity of recently-built housing in nonpoor areas. Blacks are especially likely to move to a poor tract in metropolitan areas characterized by high levels of racial residential segregation and in which poor tracts have a sizeable concentration of blacks. White households are more likely to move to a poor than to a nonpoor tract in metropolitan areas that have comparatively few African Americans. 
1	This article examines marital patterns and use of mother tongue at home among native-born Asian Americans using the 2005-2007 American Community Survey 3-Year Public Use Microdata Sample There are variations in mother-tongue use across Asian ethnic groups, but variations among different types of marriage are even greater Those who marry within their ethnicity (In-married) have a greater likelihood of mother-tongue use at home than those who Intermarry Among the in-married, those having 1 5- and first-generation co-ethnic spouses are far more likely to use a mother tongue than those having native-born co-ethnic partners Results of logistic regression analyses indicate that marital patterns are the strongest predictor of mother-tongue use at home, and that ethnic variations in mother-tongue use are significantly reduced when marital patterns are taken into account
1	The authors argue that both the large variability in survey estimates of volunteering and the fact that survey estimates do not show the secular decline common to other social capital measures are caused by the greater propensity of those who do volunteer work to respond to surveys.

0	The author employs propensity score matching techniques developed within a counterfactual causal framework to investigate the effects of father involvement on the psychological well-being of children raised in families where both biological parents are present. Results from a statistical analysis of a longitudinal data set from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey indicate: (a) among children in the sample who received the least attention from their fathers, increased father involvement would have made statistically significant and positive contributions to their psychological well-being; and (b) among children in the sample who received moderate-to-high levels of attention from their fathers, father involvement was less of a factor on psychological well-being because decreased father involvement would not have made a statistically significant difference in children’s psychological well-being. According to other family characteristics that serve as predictors of father involvement, children receiving the least attention from their fathers are assumed to come from disadvantaged families, and those receiving moderate-to-high levels of paternal attention are more likely to live in middle or upper-income families. The two primary findings have implications for social policy in support of father involvement in disadvantaged families, families marked by tense marital relationships, or families living in poverty.
1	Recent research suggests that racial residential segregation may be detrimental to health. This study investigates the influence of neighborhood racial isolation on obesity and considers the role Of neighborhood disorder as a mediator in this relationship. For the city of Philadelphia, we find that residence in a neighborhood with high black racial isolation is associated with a higher body mass index and higher odds of obesity among women, but not men, highlighting important sex differences in the influence of neighborhood structure on health. Furthermore, the influence of high racial isolation on women weight status is mediated, in part, by the physically disordered nature of such neighborhoods. Disorder of a more social nature (as measured by incident crime) is not associated with weight status.
0	When North American slavery was established in the 1600s, an ideological perspective was developed that sought to justify the institution of African American slavery. This ideological perspective, or white racial frame, was later extended to other groups, such as Latinas/os. This white racial framing, which has become a white common sense, includes important racial understandings and perceptions. There are  various forms of racial common sense among the different racial groups in the United States, but the white common sense has prevailed because whites have long had power and resources to impose this reality.  A hegemonic situation occurs when people of color consent in various ways to this white racial framing and common sense. This acceptance varies. We discuss four forms of consent to the white racial framing that appear in our in-depth interviews in a national sample of Latinas/os. Three reference Latinos: acceptance of elements of the racial frame, active enactment of the racial frame, and internalized (symbolic) violence. The fourth use of racial framing differs in that it is directed by Latinos at African Americans.
0	Relationships among marital conflict, parental hostility and sixth-grade childrens adjustment in 167 Mexican American and 111 European American families are assessed. Previous research, primarily on white non-Hispanic children, suggests that marital conflict and hostile parenting have deleterious effects on child adjustment.  We expand this research by including longitudinal data on Mexican American parents, three-fourths of whom are 1st generation immigrants. Controlling for child gender, parent acculturation, family cohesion and demographic variables in multivariate models, marital conflict and violence consistently predict internalizing and externalizing problems in Mexican American children.  Net of other predictors, hostile parenting has stronger effects for European American children.
1	In this article I argue that evolutionary theorizing can help sociologists and feminists better understand gender inequality. Evolutionary theory explains why control of the sexuality of young women is a priority across most human societies both past and present. Evolutionary psychology has extended our understanding of male violence against women. Here I add to these theories and present asexual selection argument to postulate possible evolved predispositions that promote young female deference to adult males in interaction and the converse, lack of male deference to young females. According to this argument, the pattern of greater female deference disappears when the women involved are past menopause. Put together, these ideas form an evolutionary account of gender inequality that complements and extends traditional sociological and feminist theories.
0	This manuscript demonstrates how qualitative methods can form a foundation for quantitative research by improving instrument validity.  In order to test terminology, applicability and comprehension of a quantitative questionnaire for doctors in the United States and United Kingdom, physician focus groups were conducted in both countries.  The focus group questions were organized around the experiment including (1) patient validity, (2) population accessibility, (3) level of remuneration, (4) appropriate endorsement figure, and (5) question comprehension.  Questions were amended and eliminated, and logistics were strengthened based on the groups comments.  Focus group data collected during instrument development and fieldwork planning streamlined our processes and helped improve validity for the overall study.  Beyond simply adding a qualitative component to an already free-standing quantitative methodology, we capitalized on focus groups as a methodology resulting in increased validity, and used that resource to complement the high reliability and generalizability achieved with a survey.
0	Siedman argues that the decline of popular movements in South Africa during the apartheid regime led to the rise of radicalism and the African National Congress. (Seidman 1999) This is consistent with the literature on movement cycles and repression. (Bjørgo and Horgan 2009; Brockett 1993; Davenport, Johnston, and Mueller 2005; Tarrow 1995; Zwerman and Steinhoff 2005) However, the reverse may also be true: that the decline of such radicalism can also lead to an increase in popular movements. The phenomenon of a decline of radicalization within the social movement milleu has not been adequately understood. In Colombia, the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) guerilla movement has now been in decline for at least twenty years. (Arias and Maldonado 2004) This has led to a rise in popular movements on the non-violent Left in Colombia. (Osorio and Weinstein 1998) When Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung was published in 1964, Marxist revolution seemed achievable to many. Anti-colonial movements were raging at the time and it was also the year that that the FARC was founded. The FARC was one rebel army in a wave of revolutionary movements across the globe. While this tide has long since receded, the FARC, just a vestige of what they once were, remains entrenched in the jungles while losing support in the cities.
1	This article moves beyond current controversies on the nature of money by suggesting that a general social process allows different kinds of organizations and networks-from states to banks to local communities-to produce currencies: that is, the articulation of criteria of creditworthiness, or what I call the exercise of moral authority. Bankers specialize in moral authority, but when that authority is contested, challenging groups must articulate alternative criteria of creditworthiness for their currencies to become stable and acceptable. I illustrate these processes with historical material from the postbellum United States, which I use to discuss why the federal government failed to create a stable financial system, and why local bankers engaged in a process of financial innovation that further destabilized money. I conclude with reflections on the shifting structural sources of moral authority, which have made the local level a springboard for destabilizing financial innovations.
0	This paper analyses some micro-sociological preconditions for the occurrence of corruption norms which can be treated as Social Capital with mainly negative externalities. Corruption norms provide general knowledge how to commence a corrupt deal without knowing the cor-rupt partner. Corruption norms necessarily compete with existing legal, universalistic norms because corruption norms refer to particularistic aims. This fact can be exploited to measure the impact of corruption norms indirectly. With data from the World Value Survey it is shown that certain particularistic norms significantly contribute to the explanation of a countries corruption level.
1	This study empirically examines the public and social policy question: Do state restrictive abortion laws affect the likelihood that women use more highly effective contraceptive methods? Using contraceptive use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2002 survey, the empirical results show that Medicaid Funding Restrictions, Informed Consent Laws, and Two-Visit Laws have no significant impact on adult women's (ages 1844, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44) use of highly effective contraceptive methods. A state's antiabortion attitudes, which likely contribute to the enactment of restrictive abortion laws in a state, are a major factor in inducing greater use of highly effective contraceptive methods by adult women at-risk of an unintended pregnancy. The empirical findings remain robust for various population subgroups of adult women (i.e., married, single, employed, unemployed, with children, no children and college educated). 
1	Research on philanthropy has not sufficiently examined whether charitable giving to religious causes impinges on giving to secular causes. Examining three waves of national panel data, we find that the relationship between religious and secular giving is generally not of a zero-sum nature; families that increase their religious giving also increase their secular giving. We argue that this finding is best accounted for by a practice theory of social action which emphasizes how religious congregations foster skills and practices related to charitable giving. We also argue that denominational variation in the influence of religious giving is best accounted for by the financial structuring of the denomination. We conclude with the implications for studies of religious causal influence more generally.
0	A widespread approach to assess the similarity of objects is to measure the extent to which they have similar relationships to other objects or settings. For example, the notion of structural equivalence calls two persons similar if they have similar relationships to other persons. This paper generalizes this approach and views two objects similar if they have similar relationships to \emph{similar} objects or settings. After proposing a geometrical representation for this generalized approach, we reanalyze two classic datasets: the Davis et al. (1941) data on social event attendance of 18 women, and the roll-call data of the U.S. Senate. We show that the proposed representation surpasses previous models of relational data, and illustrate how it opens up new possibilities for sociologists and social scientists in general.
0	It is cliché to emphasize the significant role of civil society in consolidating democracy. Beyond simple correlation, this paper intends to propose an analytical tool, Empowering Process Model, which helps to show more clearly under what conditions social movements as a key vehicle for democratic consolidation can empower and transform themselves to affect government policymaking. Korean human rights movements with the legacy of long-term contentious pro-democracy movements undergo a dynamic and interactive process of utilizing expanded opportunity structures, developing networks, and mobilizing new frames with a momentum of attending the Vienna world conference. After the Vienna conference, Korean human rights groups effectively have adapted to more complicated conditions but still confront various challenges from both national and international levels.
0	A reasonable amount of research attention has been given in recent years to the question of how the physical space of a classroom or learning environment influences teaching and learning. How do spaces, light, physical arrangements and technology encourage or dampen learning?  What are the sociological dimensions of these variables? The presentation also explores the question of what virtual space means for our success as teachers.
1	This research addresses a largely ignored question in the study of terror: who are its likely victims? An answer was sought through analysis of comprehensive data on civilian victims of terror in Israel from 1993 through 2003. The chances of being killed in seemingly random terror attacks were found unequally distributed in Israeli society, but the weaker sectors were not the most vulnerable. This pattern may be attributed to the perpetration of most terror attacks in public places, where members of underprivileged groups are less likely to be. Paradoxically, ethnic segregation, gender and other forms of social exclusion and inequality may have helped to protect marginalized social groups from the risk of terror victimization.
1	One of sociology's classic puzzles is how groups motivate their members to set aside self-interest and contribute to collective action. This article presents a solution to the problem based on status as a selective incentive motivating contribution. Contributors to collective action signal their motivation to help the group and consequently earn diverse benefits from group members in particular higher status and these rewards encourage greater giving to the group in the future. In Study 1, high contributors to collective action earned higher status, exercised more interpersonal influence, were cooperated with more, and received gifts of greater value. Studies 2 and 3 replicated these findings while discounting alternative explanations. All three studies show that giving to the group mattered because it signaled an individual an motivation to help the group. Study 4 finds that participants who received status for their contributions subsequently contributed more and viewed the group more positively. These results demonstrate how the allocation of respect to contributors shapes group productivity and solidarity, offering a solution to the collective action problem.
1	Analysts have shown increased interest in how social movements use tactical repertoires strategically. While the state is most often the guarantor of new benefits, many movements-from labor to the environmental movement-target corporate, educational, and other institutions. Employing a unique data set of protests reported in the New York Times (1960-90), this research examines how repertoires are, in part, contingent on the institutional target a movement selects. In particular, the authors consider the role of each target's vulnerabilities and its capacities for response-repression, facilitation, and routinization-as explanations for the degree of transgressive protest each target faces. The results provide strong evidence for considering targets as a central factor in shaping forms of social protest.
0	Nonprofits often compete for funding, legitimacy and access to clients along ideological lines.  Little is known about the roots of ideology within organizations and among them in organizational fields.  This paper draws from extensive ethnography, qualitative interviews, and document analysis to elucidate the processes by which ideologies are rooted in larger social values, like justice or freedom, and articulated in organizational structures and practices. Empirically, I examine the history of nonprofit technology assistance providers (NTAPs).  With difficulties securing steady funding and relatively inelastic prices, NTAPs have had to differentiate and compete along ideological lines for clients and access to foundation donors.  These ideological lines are articulated in service delivery models and organizational structures and rooted in the social values of individuals founding these models.
1	"Worker displacement has become a common feature of employment in the ""flexible economy."" While studies of income losses and the duration of unemployment after displacement abound, and popular accounts argue that workers often lose status, less empirical attention has been paid to the quality or prestige of employment displaced workers are able to secure after a downsizing event. This paper helps to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on changes in occupational prestige among a nationally representative sample of displaced workers who became reemployed from the January 2004 Displaced Workers and Employee Tenure Supplement of the Current Population Survey. Our findings show that displaced workers with higher levels of education, net of other factors, fared significantly better than others in job quality upon reemployment, highlighting the importance of education in retaining status and privilege in the new economy.

0	Status claims, explicit assertions of skills relevant to position in a group hierarchy, are described and analyzed.  The general theoretical perspective is theories of status generalization. Various scholars, working independently but with knowledge of each others work, have developed three, slightly different, views on how status claims can affect performance expectations, and thus, the power and prestige structure of groups. Results from a laboratory experiment confirm the general predictions, and the simplest theoretical process adequately represents the data. Some uses of the work include designing interventions to control status generalization from within a group, and effects on legitimation of group structure.
0	Exploiting retrospective data from the SHARELIFE project, we investigate long-term associations between childhood conditions, early-, and later-life unemployment experiences in a sample of more than 15,000 men and women from 13 Continental European countries. Our findings provide, first, evidence for significant differences in the life-course pattern of unemployment occurrence between welfare state regimes. Second, childhood conditions (parental SES and respondents’ health at age 10) are shown to bear significant associations with the odds of experiencing periods of unemployment throughout one’s employment career. Third, and finally, our analysis confirms previous research in that we provide clear evidence for long-term scarring effects, showing that they are indeed permanent ones, as we observe them even among older workers close to retirement. The paper concludes with a discussion of limitations and perspectives for future research.
0	Existing research on art and politics in protests portrays an instrumental relationship between the two, implying the existence of only one approach to social change—defined by the leaders of social movement organizations and supported by artists and art organizations. In contrast, this paper argues that there are at least three distinct approaches to social change in protests, each distinguished by its own specific set of media and meanings. The analysis rests on a framing-content analysis and interpretative discourse analysis informed by rhetoric of all documents circulated at four protests in France, Italy, and the UK. Political texts evidence a metonymical approach to contention—they reduce social change to political struggle, embrace collective identities, and identify political aims to achieve through the political system. Art texts, on the other hand, can be either metaphorical or ironic. Theatre, music, and creative writing typically adopt a metaphorical stance. They encourage people to make up their own meanings and objectives and to reinforce personal identities. An ironic approach toward social change is common among cartoons. Their innovation consists in expressing compassion for enemies, and in inviting people to take responsibility for themselves.
0	Studying racism from the inside out entails seeing it from the viewpoint of the person performing it. This approach requires that participants talk openly about a topic most people rarely discuss: their own racism. In order to achieve this goal, I had to make decisions about how to carry out the studydecisions about what methods to use and about whether to conduct individual or group interviews. Other decisions were strategic, such as whether to limit participation in the study to one social category (i.e., white women) or to open participation in the study to anyone interested. Another strategic decision concerned whether to limit the topic to racism aimed at black Americans or to include racism targeted at other minority groups as well. All of these decisions and the issues surrounding them are presented in the first half of this paper. I then outline how I conducted the interviews and present an analysis of changes that occurred in some participants as a result of being in the study.
0	In this paper, we introduce the concept of clinical life to capture a form of life produced in the pursuit of medical possibility.  We describe clinical life as it is expressed by aged patients and their families in the wake of receiving life-saving cardiac procedures.  Clinical life is made possible as people in the more affluent sectors of U.S. society infer specific promise about lengthened, restored life from possibility, and engage easily and naturally with what the clinic has to offer in the pursuit of the opportunities, desire, and growing obligation to extend life into ever-older ages.  Our notion of clinical life embodies the changed experience of and expectations about ones body and future as the transformative and restorative potential of medical technologies becomes a significant point of reference for evaluating life and its worth.  Clinical life is also existentially experienced in the wake of medical intervention as aging individuals subsequently manage, negotiate, and reflect upon the contours of an acceptable relationship with the world of the clinic.
1	Ground-level air pollution has serious effects on the natural environment and human health, but it has not received the same attention in the sociological literature as the greenhouse gases polluting the upper atmosphere. To address questions about the effects of social structural forces on environmental impacts, we analyze cross-national time-series data (1990-2000) to assess influences on the emission of ground-level air pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and non-methane volatile organic compounds. Drawing on human ecological theory, we move beyond previous analyses by assessing demographic effects on pollution emissions in a nuanced way by dividing population into the number of households and average household size. We found that the number of households has a greater effect on SO2 emissions than average household size. This suggests that the effect of population on the environment is not simply due to its size and growth, but also to its distribution across households. The difference we found has important implications, since the global growth rate in the number of households is greater than the growth rate in population. Furthermore, while the population growth rate in less developed nations is over four times that in developed nations, the household growth rate is only double. This finding suggests that developed nations will contribute more to air pollution in the coming years than would be assumed based on population growth alone.
1	This study revisits and extends a classic question in sociology and tests three competing hypotheses about the effects of intragenerational social class mobility on distress and psychological well-being at midlife. Prior research on this topic investigated the effects of intergenerational mobility, but did not look at how mobility during adulthood (intragenerational mobility) affects psychological distress and well-being. Previous literature is also limited by methodological problems that make it difficult to estimate the separate effects of prior social class, current social class, and social mobility. This study overcomes this methodological problem using a novel approach that breaks the linear dependence between prior class, current class, and intragenerational mobility. After accounting for prior and current class, I find that social mobility is not associated with psychological distress and self-acceptance. Instead, mobile individuals come to resemble their nonmobile counterparts in their current class on the outcomes of study. 
1	This article examines why some black Southerners but not others were politically active during the early stages of the civil rights movement. Using a survey of more than 600 black Southerners in 1961, we investigate whether perceptions about opportunity and threat, politicized social capital and individual orientations toward social change shaped voting in the 1960 Presidential election. Perceptions of solidarity in the black community and repression against politically active blacks encourage voting, while the perception of white support for integration does not. Participating in civic and religious organizations and discussing politics with friends and co-workers (but not family members) increase the likelihood of voting. Our findings extend political opportunity and social capital theories in important ways while offering new insights into this historically important case of civic engagement.
1	Using data from a representative sample of American workers, we examine the association between education and work-family conflict-a form of inter-role conflict in which role pressures from each domain are incompatible in some way. The well-educated tend to occupy professional jobs with more income and pressures, and experience more work-family role blurring activities. These conditions contribute to greater conflict among the well-educated. In addition, people with less than a high school degree report more conflict because of their experience in precarious work with variable shifts. Finally, work-family conflict is associated with distress-but less so among those with the highest and lowest education. We discuss the theoretical relevance of these findings for views about social status, stress exposure, and their implications for mental health.
1	"By applying signaling theory to the strategies gangs and their prospective members adopt during the recruitment process, this article addresses one of the most crucial unanswered questions in the literature on street gangs: why, in any given pool of individuals with similar sociological profiles and motivations, do only some gain entry into gangs? Based upon two years of ethnographic fieldwork with gang members in London, UK, this article argues that gangs face a primary trust dilemma in their uncertainty over the quality of recruits. Given that none of the desirable trust-warranting properties for gang membership can be readily discovered from observation, gangs look for observable signs correlated with these properties. Gangs then face a secondary trust dilemma in their uncertainty over the reliability Of signs because certain agents (e.g., police informants, rival gang members, and adventure seekers) might mimic them. Thus, gangs look for signs that are too costly for mimics to fake but affordable for the genuine article. This article thus demonstrates how gangs overcome their informational handicap ex ante by screening and selecting among prospective members based on ""hard-to-fake"" signals."
1	Drawing on predictions derived from self-control theory, general strain theory, and deterrence theory, we attempt to improve Braithwaite's shaming theory by identifying conditions under which its causal process might be more effective in explaining misbehavior. Using data elicited from 224 Russian respondents, we put the elaborated version of shaming theory to the test in its. In line with previous research, study findings indicate that, contrary to the theory's predictions, being reintegratively shamed is positively associated with projected deviance. While some of the hypothesized contingencies seem to condition the effects of shaming oil projected deviance, none of our findings confirm original hypotheses. These results, ill Conjunction with the accumulated body of research, Suggest that reintegrative shaming theory may be in need of further revision. 
0	In this paper I explore how members of Slow Food, an international, first world movement, enact and frame stories of resistance through what I call the global collective imaginary.  By calling attention to particular forms of resistance that reflect the innovative management of global identities in the local, I show how members of Slow Food maneuver within globally circulating narratives of political consciousness.  In particular, I examine how notions of resistance and identity are negotiated and deployed through the creation and maintenance of the global collective imaginary.  Through the use of the global collective imaginary, members of Slow Food reconfigure linear notions of time and space and they seek to rediscover cultural moments that they perceive to be absent or disembedded from traditions in the United States.  They create a new, uneven political space that is local and global concurrently through the incorporation of a fluid and dynamic understanding of time as a method of defining social and political relations.  The global collective imaginary is just one innovative discursive form of resistance that has emerged from the milieu of globalization.
1	A growing body of research demonstrates powerful effects of international organizations on national policy, and the literature on international conflict is increasingly adopting a network perspective on international organizations, but we still know little about the network structure of the world polity itself. This is surprising in light of the theoretical implications of world polity theory, world systems theory, and the world civilizations approach to the structure of the world polity. Using data on a set of prominent intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), along with a comparison to the complete population of IGOs, this study examines the world polity as a network structured by symbolic and material conflict. Network analysis reveals a contradictory duality in the structure of the world polity: while states are densely interconnected through international organizations, these international organizations are only sparsely interconnected. Contrary to world polity theory, world system position and world civilization predict position in the world polity. These results show that, in neglecting the network structure of the world polity, previous research has underestimated the extent of structural inequality in the world polity. Because embeddedness in the world polity has such powerful effects on state policies, international trade, and international conflict, the centralization and fragmentation of the world polity may have disintegrative implications for world politics.
0	Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), I measure the strength of various factors in predicting teen fatherhood. Due to the prevalence of single-parent families resulting in an increased risk of poverty and decreased social capital for children, better understanding of early fatherhood is beneficial for researchers, therapists, policymakers and other professionals. Similar to Warrs (1993) analysis on peer and parental influence on deviance, and Thornberry and colleagues (1997) analysis of home and personal characteristics, I use path analysis to examine the effect of multiple domains (home environment and peer influence and personal deviance) on the transition to teen fatherhood. Results show that personal deviance, leading to off-timed fatherhood, is a product of a combination of deviant peer influence and a negative home environment.
0	Sociological studies of earnings and inequality are often critical of the importance attached to human capital and skill-biased technological change in the economics literature, mainly because such studies do not seek to embed the relationship between education and earnings in its institutional context, and in so doing, reify the invisible hand theory of markets. But most sociological work on inequality merely sidesteps the problem by taking human capital theories as a given and focusing on other institutional sources of earnings variation, such as the changing organization of work. In this paper I consider whether human capital operates differently across different political economic contexts. I examine trends in earnings inequality from 1970 to 2000 in a sample of 81 U.S. metropolitan labor markets. I use growth curve analysis (HLM) to determine whether the relationship between educational advantage and inequality in metropolitan labor markets varies across state political economic contexts. I find that labor markets with more college educated workers are more unequal across the thirty-year period, but that the size of this effect is considerably smaller within states with weak labor unions and low taxes (right-to-work states). Political economic context helps shape the interplay of labor market supply and demand.

The DJ world has many aspects so we examine a bit of the history of the occupation and look at the changes that have taken place in the last decade, some of which are due to new technologies. We believe that there is a ""romanticization"" of certain styles of presentation and production, reflected in the emphasis on using records (vinyl) rather than CDs. The historical and ethnographical material is set within a theoretical framework that is an extension of Symbolic Interactionism. Our emphasis is on the theoretical layers of the ""significant symbol"" as an aspect of the general semiotic system in society. We feel that Blumer's SI should not just be limited to the micro-level aspects of a phenomenon like the Club DJ world."
1	This paper draws on data from the Monitoring Mt. Laurel Study, a new survey-based study that enables us to compare residents living in an affordable housing project in a middle-class New Jersey suburb to a comparable group of non-residents. Building on the theoretical and empirical contributions of the Gautreaux and Moving to Opportunity studies, we test the hypothesis that living in this housing project improves a poor person's economic prospects relative to what they would have experienced in the absence of such housing, and that these improved prospects can be explained at least in part by reduced exposure to disorder and stressful life events. We find that residents in the Ethel Lawrence Homes are significantly less likely to experience disorder and negative life events and that this improvement in circumstances indirectly improves the likelihood of being employed, their earnings, and the share of income from work. We find no relationship between residence in the housing project and the likelihood of using welfare. 
0	In this study a new grandparent identity measure is constructed that allows us to compare grandparent identity meanings with the meanings of other adult identities.  I also investigate the relationships between identities and well-being.   Data were collected in 1997 from 203 middle-aged grandmothers and grandfathers living in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, North Carolina metropolitan area.   Grandparent and parent identity meanings are measured a set of ten adjective pairs. Intergenerational family identity combined grandparent and parent identity meanings.  Self-esteem and depressive symptoms serve as two indicators of well-being.  I find that there are no differences between grandparent and parent identity meanings but that men and women had higher grandparent identity meanings than religious, friend, or spouse identity meanings.  Further, grandparent identity is significantly related to higher self-esteem and lower levels of depressive symptoms when it is the only identity in the model but not when parent identity is included in another model.  Finally, intergenerational family identity is positively related to self-esteem and negatively related to depressive symptoms.  The findings confirm the expectation that grandparent identity meanings may encourage well-being.  Further, the intergenerational identity reflects the overlapping meanings and experiences of being a parent and a grandparent.
1	"Survey researchers often administer batteries of questions to measure respondents' abilities, but these batteries are not always designed in keeping with the principles of optimal test construction. This paper illustrates one instance in which following these principles can improve a measurement tool used widely in the social and behavioral sciences: the GSS's vocabulary test called ""Wordsum"". This ten-item test is composed of very difficult items and very easy items, and item response theory (IRT) suggests that the omission of moderately difficult items is likely to have handicapped Wordsum's effectiveness. Analyses of data from national samples of thousands of American adults show that after adding four moderately difficult items to create a 14-item battery, ""Wordsumplus"" (1) outperformed the original battery in terms of quality indicators suggested by classical test theory; (2) reduced the standard error of IRT ability estimates in the middle of the latent ability dimension; and (3) exhibited higher concurrent validity. These findings show how to improve Wordsum and suggest that analysts should use a score based on all 14 items instead of using the summary score provided by the GSS, which is based on only the original 10 items. These results also show more generally how surveys measuring abilities (and other constructs) can benefit from careful application of insights from the contemporary educational testing literature.

0	This paper describes the changes in the racial gaps between black and white children and ethnic gaps between Hispanic and white children as they progress from kindergarten to fifth grade, using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten data. We find that the black-white gaps have been widened as child progress up to fifth grade and the widening gaps largely result from the initial lags. At the same time, the Hispanic-white gaps have been narrowed slightly. In particular, Hispanic children born to U.S. Mexicans are able to catch up in reading and math, mostly due to their faster growth during first grade.  We further find that girls and boys show the similar stair-step pattern in the racial and ethnic gaps. In addition to gender differentials, we find that within the same level of family socioeconomic status, the racial and ethnic gaps persist, although with smaller magnitude. Finally, our results show that low birth weight only affect the achievement gaps between Hispanic children born to U.S. Mexican mothers and whites.
0	Based on the resource-based view and upper echelons theory, the present paper introduces an alternative model in studying start-ups. Unlike any existing studies of start-ups, particularly human capital model and organizational ecologist model, the present study takes a social network perspective and emphasizes the effects of sociodemographic factors (sex/gender and race/ethnicity) and upper echelons affiliations with various kinds of companies on the survival of start-ups. Plausible propositions that can be derived from the proposed model are stated.
1	Recent patterns of labor exit in late life in the United States are increasingly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity stems from diverse employment careers that are emerging in the workplace where job security is declining. Individuals' structural locations in the labor market expose them to diverse risks for employment and income security at older ages. Among those risks are access to institutional mechanisms for retirement saving and the requirement to assume full responsibility for decisions about retirement savings that involve market risks. The spread of these individualized pressures to invest in retirement has elevated the importance of financial literacy in the 21(st) century. Late employment careers and patterns of financial literacy are studied in this article using the premier U.S. longitudinal dataset from the National Institute of Aging, the Health and Retirement Study initiated in 1992, which is linked to restricted Social Security earnings records that extend over several decades. These merged data afford the opportunity to observe continuous work histories in this sample from 1981 through 2006 to identify latent trajectories of employment in late life. In addition, a supplementary module attached to the 2004 wave of the HRS provides valuable information on the financial literacy of subgroups. The work-retirement trajectories and financial literacy patterns observed reflect persistent patterns of inequality amplified by modern risks in the labor market.
1	How do social movements influence corporations? Recent work suggests that movements can inflict material damage on their targets and shape categories of evaluation in organizational fields. Extending these ideas, we examine the effects of anti-sweatshop campaigns on sales, stock performance, reputation and specialized ratings of U. S. firms, using fixed-effects regression models and event study methods. The analysis demonstrates that social movements can in some circumstances shape both the markets and fields that firms inhabit. Specifically, anti-sweatshop campaigns (1. had negative effects on sales (though only among certain types of firms), (2. influenced stock prices, and (3. shaped specialized ratings of corporate responsibility. They also diminished previously positive corporate reputations (to a modest degree) but did not radically alter reputational hierarchies in the business community.
0	We examine the relationship between perceived discrimination and physical and emotional health using a national longitudinal survey of the elderly born in 1953 and earlier.  We ask two major research questions:  We ask three major research questions: (1) What factors predict experience of discrimination among the elderly? (2) How does experience of discrimination affect physical and emotional health over a two-year period among the elderly? And (3) Do everyday discrimination and major discriminatory events have similar effects on health and well-being?  Our results are generally consistent with previous research.  It shows that experience of discrimination is socially determined, and is affected by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.  Blacks, other races, and people with lower wealth are more likely to experience discrimination.  Also consistent with previous research, we find a negative association between perceived discrimination and changes in health over a two-year period, and that everyday discrimination has stronger effects on health, especially on emotional health, than major discriminatory events.  These findings suggest that efforts to eliminate discrimination could have the potential to improve health and well-being of the elderly.
1	The relationship between assimilation and the well-being of immigrant children has been the focus of debate in the recent sociological literature. Much of this work has questioned whether classical theories of immigrant adaptation, which assumed assimilation to be an integral part of the process of upward mobility for immigrants, are still applicable to today's immigrant children. This study reevaluates the applicability of classical assimilation theory with a comprehensive empirical assessment of the relationship between assimilation and the well-being of Hispanic and Asian immigrant adolescents. Using Add Health data, we examine the effect of different aspects of assimilation on educational achievement, psychological well-being, and at-risk behaviors. We find that the effect of assimilation varies greatly depending on the ethnic group and outcome under consideration, but that it is generally related to both greater academic achievement and more at-risk behavior. We conclude that assimilation theory is still relevant, but suggest an interpretation that emphasizes a process of decreasing differences between groups rather than either detrimental or beneficial effects of assimilation.

0	"Although there has been a widespread interest in the experiences and struggles faced by immigrant families in their host society, research on second-generation immigrants, particularly females, has been scarce. The experiences of second-generation immigrant children may differ significantly from those of their parents. Some social science theories have suggested that the more exposure to host country culture, the more likely second-generation youths would take on their adoptive countries' identity and reduce ties to the immigrant or ethnic identities and culture of their parents. This paper seeks to explore the different facets of cultural identity of second-generation Arab-background women living in the Greater Toronto Area, testing the applicability of some theoretical frameworks and constructions that have assumed a deficit model in the interpreting the ""lived experiences"" of second-generation immigrant youths. These women are at the intersection of two distinct cultures - that of their parents, and the one of the dominant Euro-White Canadian society - with often competing expectations at many levels: traditions, gender expectations, religion, and politics."
0	This study examines the impact of risk and protective factors on the odds that African-American adolescents seriously think about or attempt suicide. The data were obtained from all students in grades 5-12 from a single school district in this central city mostly urban, Alabama community. The survey took place in May 2002 and of the 2,464 eligible participants (based on average daily attendance), a total of 1,614 (65.5 percent) of the students completed the survey. Due to the nature of the research question, only surveys completed by African American students in a regular school setting were analyzed which reduced the number of survey respondents to 1,526. Our findings support earlier work documenting differences in gender and grades; females and older adolescents think seriously and attempt suicide more than males and younger students. Risk factors were uniformly significant and as a block of variables, were important to understanding both ideation and attempts among this sample of students. However, protective factors were not consistent predictors; the much anticipated lowering role of religious protective factors was limited, though students belonging to or their perception of belonging to a spiritual community was a significant factor in lowering the odds of suicide ideation.
1	Sociology with a Southern face characterizes Southern sociologists and Southern social issues. This article asks why we are sociologists and what we are doing about it in the South. I posit that many Southern sociologists share common biographical experiences that provide insights for understanding and solving Southern problems. Longstanding conditions of the Black Belt are used as an example with special focus on Southern demographics and persistent impoverishment. Given the magnitude of the southern issues involved, I believe there are good reasons for doing sociology about the South. I conclude with a call for sociologists with Southern faces - wherever they live - to pay greater attention to solutions as well as using our sociological expertise to diagnose social problems we see through the Southern face of sociology.
1	This research compares representations of rap music with the self-reported criminal behavior and resistant attitudes of the Musics core audience. Our database is a large sample of Toronto high school Students (n = 3,393) from which we identify a group of listeners, whose combination of musical likes and dislikes distinguish them as rap univores. W then examine the relationship between their cultural preference for rap music and involvement in a Culture of crime and their perceptions of social injustice and inequity. We find that the rap univores, also known as urban music enthusiasts, report significantly more delinquent behavior and stronger feelings of inequity and injustice than listeners with other musical tastes. However, we also find that the nature and strengths of those relationships vary according to the racial identity of different groups within urban music enthusiasts. Black and white subgroups align themselves with resistance representations while Asians do not; whites and Asians report significant involvement in crime and delinquency, while blacks do not. Finally, we discuss our findings in light of research on media effects and audience reception, youth Subcultures and post-subcultural analysis, and the sociology Of Cultural consumption.
1	International poverty research has increasingly underscored the need to use multidimensional approaches to measure poverty. Largely embraced in Europe and elsewhere, this has not had much impact on the way poverty is measured in the United States. In this paper, I use a comprehensive multidimensional framework including economic well-being, capability, and social inclusion to examine poverty in the US. Data from the 2004 General Social Survey support the interconnectedness among these poverty dimensions, indicating that the multidimensional framework utilizing a comprehensive set of information provides a compelling value added to poverty measurement. The suggested demographic characteristics of the various categories of the poor are somewhat similar between this approach and other traditional approaches. But the more comprehensive and accurate measurement outcomes from this approach help policymakers target resources at the specific groups. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	This paper reports results of an experiment on the relationship between whites' implicit racial bias and prosocial behavior toward blacks. We hypothesized that implicit anti-black bias would lead to less prosocial behavior (generosity with limited monetary resources). Consistent with our hypothesis, the results revealed that implicit anti-black bias, measured by the Implicit Association Test, had a negative effect on generosity toward blacks. This finding extends prior work by showing that implicit racial bias affects non-hypothetical decisions about how to allocate limited monetary resources. We conclude with a discussion of implications and suggestions for future work. 
0	This paper focuses on differences between the educational systems in German states and their influence on educational opportunity. After analyzing differing institutional regulations of structures and contents, a typology and four types of educational systems are identified. The effects of these types on social inequality are analyzed for East Germany, where three of the types were introduced after unification and differences in educational participation can largely be attributed to these distinct educational systems that followed the uniform socialist one. It can be shown that the type of educational system has enormous influence on the extent of social inequality.
0	In recent decades, many aspects of social life have become more formal, especially in areas involving organizations. Much of the formalization surrounding organizations involves implementing highly formal written rules. In this paper, I draw on a case study of the judging changes in figure skating following the 2002 Olympic judging scandal to examine how formalization affects organizational culture. The effects of these judging changes, which have profoundly changed the whole culture of figure skating, are anomalous in relation to arguments within institutional theory that organizations tend to separate their formal structures from their daily practices. This paper advances organization theory by making sense of when and why changing rules fundamentally changes organizational culture. I argue that formalization, specifically through changing rules, is more likely to change organizational culture when organizational members have very high stakes in internalizing and complying with rule changes and outside pressure, and when an organization is accountable to a more powerful institution. Even when organizations adopt more formal procedures to pursue noble ends, formalization can lead to far-reaching and sometimes detrimental consequences. This paper underscores the political implications of rules and standards, and the importance of studying the effects of formalization.
0	This paper examines conditions and consequences of sociologys fizzling out at the edges, a process through which sociology passes areas of specialization on to newly institutionalizing fields with their own academic departments, associations, journals, and funding programs.  Examining the case of American crime and crime control research, we find support for arguments from the sociology of science regarding push factors such as sociologys structural weakness and task uncertainty.  Theses from political sociology are also supported as they point at pull factors such as government research funding, demand for training in new or expanding government-induced occupational fields, and the production of data sets and accompanying training programs by government agencies.  The process is described based on a growing body of literature on the history of criminology and on the analysis of a data set resulting from content analysis of 1,612 journal articles on crime and crime control.  The analysis indicates that shifts in the structure of crime research are accompanied by changes in the structure of social science knowledge about crime and crime control.  The article concludes with considerations regarding the external validity of findings for other specialty areas in sociology and for sociology in other national contexts.
1	Using a nationally representative sample of adolescents, we examine associations among social integration (network size), network cohesion (alter-density), perceptions of social relationships (e.g., social support) and adolescent depressive symptoms. We find that adolescents with either too large or too small a network have higher levels of depressive symptoms. Among girls, however, the ill effects of over-integration only occur at low levels of network cohesion. For boys, in contrast, the ill effects of over-integration only occur at high levels of network cohesion. Large social networks tend not to compromise positive perceptions of friend support or belonging; whereas, small networks are associated with low perceptions of friend support and belonging. Hence, perceptions of social relationships mediate the ill effects of under-integration, but not over-integration, on depressive symptoms.
0	In this study I analyze data collected by the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) to determine the impact of experiences with racial diversity in college on students racial attitudes and values at a small liberal arts university in California.  Exposure to diversity during college was found to play an important role in changing students racial perspectives, net of social background characteristics, although students pre-college attitudes were found to be the strongest predictors of change in students attitudes across groups. Findings also suggest that college experiences do not have the same impact on all students.  Experiences with diversity in college were found to have more of an impact on shifting the racial perspectives of Asian American students and students from low income families.  These racial and economic differences underscore the complexity of the impact of college and the importance of considering individual differences between students.  It is clear that the impact of experiences with diversity in college vary in magnitude for different kinds of students and that ascribed variables such as race and family economic background play a significant role.  This is evidence of the importance of being sensitive to the possibility that not all students will benefit equally from the same college experiences.
0	This paper examines the determinants of social programs development in China, using the case of urban basic medical insurance scheme which was initiated in 1999.  Panel data ranging from 1999 to 2005 were collected from statistics yearbooks. Then I derived hypotheses from various approaches: logic of industrialism, state centered approach, gender perspective and employer centered thesis. Findings are consistent with logic of industrialism and state autonomy which reflect Chinas political economy. Yet the results of gender ratio, state capacity and employers role are unexpected or incongruent. This paper delineated a dynamic picture of factors and actors that influence social policy development in China. But inconsistent findings call for more sophisticated data or in-depth case studies.

1	Literature on aggression often suggests that individual deficiencies, such as social incompetence, psychological difficulties, or troublesome home environments, are responsible for aggressive behavior. In this article, by contrast, we examine aggression from a social network perspective, arguing that social network centrality, our primary measure of peer status, increases the capacity for aggression and that competition to gain or maintain status motivates its use. We test these arguments using a unique longitudinal dataset that enables separate consideration of same- and cross-gender aggression. We find that aggression is generally not a maladjusted reaction typical of the socially marginal; instead, aggression is intrinsic to status and escalates with increases in peer status until the pinnacle of the social hierarchy is attained. Over time, individuals at the very bottom and those at the very top of a hierarchy become the least aggressive youth. We also find that aggression is influenced not so much by individual gender differences as by relationships with the other gender and patterns of gender segregation at school. When cross-gender interactions are plentiful, aggression is diminished. Yet these factors are also jointly implicated in peer status: in schools where cross-gender interactions are rare, cross-gender friendships create status distinctions that magnify the consequences of network centrality.
1	"We evaluate the importance of judgments about work for the attainment process in the ""new economy."" Findings show continuing links between social origins and work orientations at age 21/22, as well as significant effects of work orientations on occupational outcomes at age 31/32. Higher socio-economic status background, and stronger self-perceived ability, are tied to weaker extrinsic orientations. Young women are more intrinsically oriented than young men. Stronger intrinsic orientations predict holding jobs that offer more intrinsic rewards, self-direction and security. Stronger extrinsic orientations predict higher biweekly earnings (largely via work hours), but not more prestigious, better paying or more secure jobs. Judgments about work, and especially intrinsic orientations, thus remain important precursors of occupational attainments, despite economic turbulence and change in the transition to adulthood."
0	This paper presents the preliminary analysis of the association of school quality with immigrant status using traditional and new measures, and the association of immigrant status and educational attainment by using standardized test scores.  We used the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS: 88).  Our analysis shows significant associations between school quality and immigrant status and between educational attainment and immigrant status, which encourages further research on the relationships between educational outcomes and school quality for immigrant children.
0	Over the past two decades, the work of Pierre Bourdieu has experienced ever-increasing popularity in American sociology.  The period of Bourdieus rise to prominence, however, has also witnessed the decline of a once towering sociological figure: Talcott Parsons. In lauding Bourdieus innovativeness and vilifying of Parsons functionalism, contemporary appraisals make it difficult to see similarities in the two theorists work.  Current reputations notwithstanding, however, Bourdieu and Parsons were similar in that they developed comprehensive theories of action as a basis for understanding larger social structures.  Juxtaposition of the work of these two theorists reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and suggests directions for future work in refining theories of social action.  I this paper, I argue that at the micro level, Parsons creates a sharp analytical distinction between action and actor.  While this allows him to create a nuanced account of social acts, it leaves him with an underdeveloped notion of the actor at the macro level.  Bourdieu, through his concept of habitus, blurs the distinction between action and actor.  Although his account of action is less developed at the micro level, the blurring ultimately leads to a robust depiction of macro level social action.
1	Increasingly, scholars have come to see the news media as playing a pivotal role in shaping whether social movements are able to bring about broader social change. By drawing attention to movements' issues, claims, and supporters, the news media can shape the public agenda by influencing public opinion, authorities, and elites. Why are some social movement organizations more successful than others at gaining media coverage? Specifically, what organizational, tactical, and issue characteristics enhance media attention? We combine detailed organizational survey data from a representative sample of 187 local environmental organizations in North Carolina with complete news coverage of those organizations in 11 major daily newspapers in the two years following the survey (2,095 articles). Our analyses reveal that local news media favor professional and formalized groups that employ routine advocacy tactics, mobilize large numbers of people, and work on issues that overlap with newspapers' focus on local economic growth and well-being. Groups that are confrontational, volunteer-led, or advocate on behalf of novel issues do not garner as much attention in local media outlets. These findings have important implications and challenge widely held claims about the pathways by which movement actors shape the public agenda through the news media.
0	The rising incidence of adolescent obesity in the United States is now deemed an epidemic among Americas youth, with its prevention and treatment at the forefront of national health objectives.  This paper serves to examine the link between socioeconomic status and obesity in adolescents, giving special attention to the unequal distribution of resources at the school and community level.  The analyses, using data from Wave II of the Add Health study, show a strong negative effect of parental SES on adolescent BMI and a positive effect on physical activity levels, net of the incidence of parental obesity suggesting that this is simply not an effect of genetic makeup or household behaviors.  On average, an adolescent tends to lose anywhere between 2 to almost 9 BMI percentile points simply based on the parents level of education.  In terms of contextual factors, the higher the proportion of local governmental spending on education, female adolescent BMI percentiles, on average, drop by more or less 12 points.  In addition, a surprising positive relationship, tantamount to an addition of 2 to 9 percentile points, between school health instruction and BMI emerges.
0	This paper is motivated by the recent resurgence of interest in the economic development of raw material rich countries.   The rapid increase in raw material demand from China and India has revived the debate about the costs and benefits of raw material extraction in resource rich countries, but with an emphasis on the new dynamic of South-South trade and investment.  While the debate has been prominent in the popular press, it has not been grounded in empirical studies or linked to theories on resource wealth and development.  This paper thus has two objectives.  The first is to provide a critical assessment of the idea that there is a resource curse such that countries with economies that rely heavily on raw material production are economically disadvantaged relative to other countries in the world economy.  The second is to employ the world systems perspective to develop a cohesive analytical framework for understanding how raw material wealth is linked to economic outcomes.  The intention of this analysis is to support subsequent informed predictions about how changes in the structure of trade relations between southern countries might change the future economic prospects of raw material rich countries.
0	Immigration legislation after 9/11 or what might be termed homeland security racism, signals the emergence of what might also be understood as a new form of institutionalized nativism.  In this paper I ask how homeland security politics at the turn of the twenty-first century compares with previous forms of nativism.  Anti-immigrant sentiments are not a new phenomenon in the United States and many scholars have found that more recent forms of nativism have been primarily directed against illegal or undocumented immigrants.  What I find, however, is that todays nativism is highly institutionalized, through key post 9/11 immigration legislation.  Significantly, new institutionalized nativism is resulting in the blurring of the legal distinctions between legal and illegal immigrant, and immigrant and refugee rendering all categories of non-citizen as undesirable and suspect.  As a consequence, institutionalized nativism is not merely aimed at bolstering the nations borders from in-flows of immigrants.  More significantly institutionalized nativism is aimed at expanding technologies of surveillance and apparatuses of policing to identify immigrants, regardless of legal status, for removal from American society through long periods of detention and ultimately deportation.   In addition, refugees, once a distinct and almost valorized category of foreigner, no longer enjoy the legal privileges they once did.  This paper explores how today's nativism is eroding immigrant rights in the United States through ethnographic and interview research in California and New Jersey.
1	Women's employment and childrearing are competing activities, which exert much pressure on their time and energy. Many studies have found that women in paid employment, especially in a demanding career, limit their fertility and have few children or none. This negative correlation was explained mainly in terms of opportunity costs and the incompatibility of women's employment and childrearing. This study focuses on the interplay between women's employment and fertility decisions in Israel, a socially diverse country, characterized by high levels of both fertility and female employment. We argue that in an environment which supports and encourages high fertility women's employment activity is less consequential for family planning. The study analyzes simultaneously the decision to have a third child and the decision to work. The findings show that fertility affects negatively women's work activity, but women's employment has no effect on their decision to have an additional child. Also, cultural variables affect the fertility decision but not economic considerations, while the opposite holds for the work decision. 
1	This study establishes a socio-demographic theory of international development derived from selected classical and contemporary sociological theories. Four hypotheses are tested. (1 population growth's effect on development depends on age-structure; (2 historic population density (used here as an indicator of preindustrial social complexity) boosts contemporary economic performance; (3. ethnic polarization impairs economic growth; and (4. a nation's degree of sociolinguistic integration positively influences economic performance. Investigating annual changes in real gross domestic product per capita from 1970 to 2000, our pooled time-series analyses of 101 developed and developing countries generally support these hypotheses net of common alternative explanations, suggesting that the etiology of economic growth COLT Id benefit from the reintroduction of classic and contemporary sociological theories
1	We predict effects of behavior patterns and status on performance expectations and group inequality using an integrated theory developed by Fisek, Berger and Norman (1991). We next test those predictions using new experimental techniques we developed to control behavior patterns as independent variables. In a 10-condition experiment, predictions accounted for about 72 percent of variance in the data, with closer fit for women than for men. The gender difference may be related to features of the experiment, especially to the experimental design that counters cultural gender prescriptions in some conditions. We suggest ways to improve the experiment by more precisely separating behavior from inferred performance competence in later research. Applications include using behavior to reduce undesirable effects of status generalization.
1	"This article explores the origins of a social form with lasting and profound sociological implications: the corporation. Though corporations date back as far as the Roman Republic, the early United States fostered a significant transformation in corporate law Shortly after the American Revolution, several states pioneered a system whereby corporate charters became available to almost anyone (at a price), leading (eventually) to a proliferation of corporate charters unlike anything ever seen before in world history. This proliferation of corporate charters first occurred in colonies that were originally chartered as corporations: Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, all of which used the corporate organizational form for a wide array of social pursuits. These colonies also experienced repeated conflict with the Crown over the rights and privileges of corporations. As American ""states,"" they built on these experiences to liberalize access to the means of incorporation and to elucidate the rights and freedoms of corporations. Other studies aptly document the diffusion of the corporate organizational form after 1800; this article takes up the antecedents to the use and popularity of the modern corporate organizational form. These observations do not supersede scholarly work regarding the economic origins of the American business corporation, but they do shed valuable light on the interdependence of states and markets, as well as the nature of institutional-legal transformation more generally."
0	Given the growing incidence of incarceration, study of the collateral consequences of incarceration is an increasingly important task.  Many scholars have undertaken this task by studying social consequences such as family loss, forfeiture of voting rights, increased morbidity, loss of other civil rights, and blocked employment opportunities.  The current study concerns itself with another collateral consequence that has not been studied  death.  Using administrative data from the Bureau of Justice statistics, this paper utilizes the parole population to study the differential impact of length of stay in prison on future mortality.  Parolees constitute a population that experienced prison and remains under correctional supervision allowing the collection of mortality data.  The findings indicate that each additional year in prison equals an 8.4% increase in the odds of death for parolees.  Death is indeed another collateral consequence of incarceration and one that requires further exploration that can ideally lead to some intervention, as it is one consequence that can never be reversed.
1	We fare sanctions are financial penalties applied to individuals who fail to comply with welfare program rules. Their widespread tee reflects a turn toward disciplinary approaches to poverty management. In this article, we investigate how implicit racial biases and discrediting social markers interact to shape officials' decisions to impose sanctions. We present experimental evidence based on hypothetical vignettes that case managers are more likely to recommend sanctions for Latina and black clients-but not white clients-when discrediting markers are present. We triangulate these findings with analyses of state administrative data. Our results for Latinas are mixed, but we find consistent evidence that the probability of a sanction rises significantly when a discrediting marker (i.e., a prior sanction for noncompliance) is attached to a black rather than a white welfare client. Overall, our study clarifies how racial minorities, especially, African Americans, are more likely to be punished for deviant behavior in the new world of disciplinary we fare provision.
0	Political transitions to competitive (pluralistic) democracies in sub-Saharan Africa have received mixed reviews. Existing research has focused on the type of political regimes which emerged after the political transitions and have focused on transformations (negative and positive) within the political sphere. The extent to which this political transformation has affected quality of life in the sub-Saharan Africa region remains unknown. This paper explores the impact of transition to multiparty system on infant mortality rates in Tanzania. This paper estimates the effect of the political transition on aggregate decline in infant mortality for the whole country, and then, further analyses highlight regional differences in the risk of infant survival conditioned on a given region’s level of support of the incumbent political party, Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM). Preliminary findings points to an aggregate improvement in infant survival in the period following the introduction of multiparty system in Tanzania. However it appears that   regional inequality in infant survival also widened after the transition. Further qualitative work will be undertaken to explain these findings. And, a cross-country statistical analysis which will also include Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia will explore further these temporal trends in infant survival after first multiparty elections in these countries. The cross country analysis will also link the aforementioned “democratic” reforms to implementation of neoliberal reforms through Structural Adjustment Programs which took place in same period (late 1980s-2000).
0	How are public legal rights created by a legislature privatized (i.e., moved into the private sector) by business organizations?  To answer this question nestled at the intersection of organizations and law, I draw on two bodies of research that often ignore one another: political science studies of how organizations influence public legal institutions and neo-institutional organizational sociology studies of how organizations shape law within their organizational field.  By integrating these diverse literatures, I demonstrate how an organizational fields construction of what constitutes compliance shapes the meaning of law among legislators and courts.   Specifically, my case study examines case law and over thirty-five years of California legislative history concerning its consumer warranty protection laws.  I show how automobile manufacturers initially subject to powerful consumer protection laws created private dispute resolution venues that the legislature subsequently incorporated into statutes and made consumer rights and remedies contingent on first using manufacturer dispute resolution structures.  Further, I demonstrate how the legislature and courts consistently deferred to these private venues.  When legal and organizational fields overlap, organizational norms and values concerning private institutional venues flow into the legislative and judicial arena and shape the meaning of law.  This paper concludes by positing that organizational responses to law in the consumer context results in a transformation and weakening of the formal rights, which I refer to as the holsterization of rights, i.e., the process whereby initially strong public legal rights are (1) redefined and (2) controlled by private organizations.
1	"Prevailing theory assumes that people enforce norms in order to pressure others to act in ways that they approve. Yet there are numerous examples of ""unpopular norms"" in which people compel each other to do things that they privately disapprove. While peer sanctioning suggests a ready explanation for why people conform to unpopular norms, it is harder to understand why they would enforce a norm they privately oppose. The authors argue that people enforce unpopular norms to show that they have complied out of genuine conviction and not because of social pressure. They use laboratory experiments to demonstrate this ""false enforcement"" in the context of a wine tasting and an academic text evaluation. Both studies find that participants who conformed to a norm due to social pressure then falsely enforced the norm by publicly criticizing a lone deviant. A third study shows that enforcement of a norm effectively signals the enforcer's genuine support for the norm. These results demonstrate the potential for a vicious cycle in which perceived pressures to conform to and falsely enforce an unpopular norm reinforce one another."
0	Recent research on moral reasoning suggests that humans have moral intuitions which strongly shape how we reason about moral issues.  Neuroscientists have found structures in the brain which explain consistent patterns in how people judge hypothetical moral dilemmas.  Our study merged recent research by psychologists with prior research by social psychologists on conformity.  We conducted an experiment in which subjects were faced with a choice of affirming their moral intuitions, or agreeing with a group which disagreed with their moral intuitions.   We found that social interactions had a strong effect on how subjects reasoned about moral dilemmas, which suggests that social interaction is an important part of moral reasoning.
0	In this paper, I will briefly discuss the background and origins of the federal public housing program.  The federal public housing program has the reputation as being a decaying dumping ground for housing some of the poorest families in the US.  In fact, this short history will show that program has evolved significantly over time, but was rooted in a very idealistic and paternalistic view of helping the working class, not necessarily the worst off segments of society.  The purpose of public housing, as well as the financing and design, has changed greatly since the passage of the 1937 Housing Act.  Public housing was originally built on a relatively small scale as two and three story walk-ups and garden apartments, which were financed through bond initiatives and operated by setting rents to cover costs.  Beginning in the 1950s, high-rise building styles dominated the program.  High rises failed for families, in most cases, but served the elderly well.  By the 1970s rents were tied to incomes, tenants were more often poor and a financing gap emerged, which led to the deterioration of many units.  Today, the federal government is no longer in the business of financing this style of public housing, but a similar goal is met, possibly less effectively, through the low income housing tax credit program.
1	Our study extends research on the feminization of poverty by analyzing the variation in women's, men's, and feminized poverty across affluent democracies from 1969 to 2000. Specifically, we address three issues. First, we provide more recent estimates of adult women's and men's poverty and the ratio of women's to men's poverty with two different poverty measures. We suggest that by incorporating the elderly, the feminization of poverty may be greater than previously estimated. The feminization of poverty is nearly universal across affluent Western democracies 1969-2000. Second, we show that women's, men's and overall poverty are highly correlated, but the feminization of poverty diverges as a distinct social problem. Third, we find that women's, men's and overall poverty share several correlates, particularly the welfare state, though some differences exist. At the same time, several of our findings differ with past research. The feminization of poverty is only influenced by social security transfers, single motherhood and the sex ratios of the elderly and labor force participation. While power resources theory probably best explains women's, men's and overall poverty, structural theory may best explain the feminization of poverty. We conclude by discussing how analyses of the feminization of poverty contribute to debates on poverty and gender inequality. 
0	I revisit the Enron scandal, the ambiguity of whose outcome blurs our apperception of the current depression, its causes and its possible consequences.  The difficulties of appointing accountability for that scandal in the early years of the new century handicap our response to the present crisis.  These difficulties reflect the pervasiveness of what I call the “no-fault society.”  They are also characteristic of what Habermas would call an acute “steering crisis” of advanced capitalism, and of what Beck (elaborating a conception of a routinized steering crisis) describes as the “unbinding of politics” in the “risk society.”  Was it individual malfeasance or systemic crisis that caused Enron’s collapse?  Did Enron fail because it was a rogue corporation or rather, precisely because it was a leading one?  Did it help precipitate today’s acute steering crisis, or was it caught up in a larger crisis already brewing?
1	More than four decades ago, the Kerner Report chronicled the violent disturbances of the 1960s and predicted that the United States was rapidly moving toward two racially separate and unequal societies. Resulting concerns about black and white inequality form a critical chapter in the history of sociological research. Few studies, however, explore trends in racial inequality in rates of violence. Has the gap between black and white violence rates significantly narrowed since 1960 and, if so, why? Drawing on recent work on assimilation and the literature on race inequality, we develop a set of hypotheses about black-white differences in violence rates and how these rates may have changed during the past four decades. We emphasize race differences in family structure, economic and educational inequality, residential integration, illicit drug involvement, and population composition. Using race-specific homicide arrest and census data on social, economic, and demographic conditions for 80 large U. S. cities from 1960 to 2000, we find substantial convergence in black-white homicide arrest rates over time, although this convergence stalled from the 1980s to the 1990s. Consistent with theoretical expectations, we find that, since the 1960s, the racial gap in homicide arrests declined more substantially in cities that had greater reductions in the ratio of black to white single-parent families, as well as in cities that experienced greater population growth and increases in the proportion of the population that is black. Also, as expected, the race gap in homicide arrests widened in cities that had an increasing ratio of black to white rates of drug arrests. Measures of racial integration, however, have no discernible impact on the black to white homicide arrest ratio.
1	Prior research finds that minority populations in the United States secure union employment as part of the process of economic incorporation. Yet little work systematically tests whether this pattern holds for the nation largest minority, Hispanics, during recent decades of union decline. After juxtaposing traditional labor market position theories of unionization with solidaristic accounts, we use 1973 to 2007 Current Population Survey 
0	I conducted an ethnographic study of film clubs in Beijing, where a group of audiences watch independent films including Chinese documentary works. With this empirical data in hand, I ask two key research questions; one descriptive, and the other more theoretically oriented question: (1) What kinds of topics are discussed and what types of opinions are expressed by the documentary audiences in urban Chinese film clubs?; (2) Given the continuing existence of restrictions and (self-)censorship on independently-produced documentary films in China, to what extent do the film clubs approximate the Habermasian ideal type of public sphere, which consists of voluntary associations outside the spheres of the state and the economy? By engaging Habermass notion of public sphere with Michel Foucaults concept of discourse, I contend that social practice of watching documentaries in urban Chinese film clubs enables two kinds of critical public discourses shaped by the specific historical and institutional conditions existing in contemporary Chinese society: (1) the documentary films themselves enabled to become a critical public discourse by an act of being watched in the film clubs; (2) the critical public discourse and debate on the films being watched.
0	Granovetter (1973, 1974) has contributed to our knowledge of labor markets by showing that people get jobs more often through their weak ties (acquaintances) than their strong ones (close friends).  His findings are based on a study of permanent employees in professional, managerial, and technical occupations in the 1960s.  Do the conclusions hold in the flexible, high-mobility, heterogeneous labor markets of the postindustrial present?   Here I use data on job changes among web workers in New York City between 1993 and 2002 to address this question.  I find that weak ties remain the best source of job leads, but that strong ties are more useful than we might expect.  Among freelancers, the diversity of organizations demanding web labor and the institution of repeat subcontracting both make different types of strong ties useful.  Among permanent web employees, strong ties transmit job information when their participants move among firms.  Strong ties ease the employment search, but their heavy use has unintended consequences: because job information rarely reaches weakly tied workers, labor pools may be difficult to expand or diversify.  These findings suggest that the relative strength of weak and strong ties depends on characteristics of the labor markets in which they occur.
0	In order to investigate the role of culture in the representation and reproduction of civic exclusion in Third World cities, I consider two protests that occurred in Metro Manila in 2001: Edsa 2, which was mainly middle class in composition, and Edsa 3, which was heavily composed of the urban poor. The kind of representations mobilized in both Edsa 2 and Edsa 3 index a boundary that is both deep-seated and pervasive, a boundary which organizes an array of distinctions in its inscription, such that mundane detailswhere one shops, what one wears and how one wears it, what TV shows one watches, etc.which say nothing in themselves, are made to divulge status distinctions. They are read as clues; sniffed out, so to speak, by an impeccable nose for social class. I ask how such everyday boundary work functions in the public sphere as a mechanism of civic exclusion, and, conversely, how it is used to contest and reframe civic exclusion, and I argue that the symbolic distinction between civil and uncivil society informed representations of Edsa 2 as an organized, morally legitimate citizens movement and Edsa 3 as disorganized, morally illegitimate, and resulting from elite manipulation. Moreover, we see in Edsa 2 and Edsa 3 the performance of opposing conceptions of citizenship.
0	This research focuses on the U.S. environmental movement and explores how (or even if) social movement activity influences environmental legislation as it moves through key stages in the political process. This research uses a unique data set that follows “environmental policy proposals” introduced in Congress to address a key theoretical debate in the social sciences about whether or not grassroots’ social movement activity actually influences desired outcomes. We find that political protest by constituents has no impact on either the amount or success of legislation introduced by their state representatives.  However, having greater numbers of locally-based environmental lobbyist organizations oriented toward changing federal laws does increase chances that legislation sponsored by state representatives will meet with success in Congress. We also find that the common practice of introducing identically-worded bills significantly lowers the chances of success that any one of them will be enacted into law
0	Altruism, defined loosely as behavior that increases others' immediate wellbeing at the expense of one's own, is difficult to explain in an evolutionary context: the mechanisms of natural selection appear to favor uncooperative tendencies. Existing scholarly work that aims to resolve this puzzle relies on structural assumptions that are difficult to justify in the framework of evolution. The model presented in this paper circumvents the need for such assumptions by incorporating an evolving network component to natural selection. Through a process of co-evolution of individual and relational traits, many of the exogenous assumptions of previous models of the evolution of cooperation are realized endogenously within a simulated population. Such endogeneity allows a more precise examination of the conditions under which cooperation arises, but also a clearer understanding of how those conditions themselves arise. The model is specified analytically, and interpretation is carried out on simulated outcomes.
1	Most sociological research assumes that social network composition shapes individual beliefs. Network theory and research has not adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the influence of other structural factors, including prior network composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be reconsidered.
1	This article examines the diffusion of protest tactics among social movement organizations (SMOs) through their collaboration in protest groups. Using a longitudinal data set of SMO protest activity between 1960 and 1995, the authors adapt novel methods for dealing with two forms of selection and measurement bias in network analysis: (i) the mechanism that renders some SMOs more likely to select into collaboration and (ii) the notion that diffusion is an artifact of homophily or indirect learning rather than influence. The authors find that collaboration is an important channel of tactical diffusion and that SMOs with broader tactical repertoires adopt more tactics via their collaboration with other SMOs, but only up to a point. Engaging in more collaboration also makes SMOs more active transmitters and adopters of new tactics. Finally, initial overlap in respective tactical repertoires facilitates the diffusion of tactics among collaborating SMOs.

Survey research has linked this opposition to the belief that such policies disadvantage white men with respect to employment and promotions.  In spite of the widespread prevalence of this belief, there has been little research examining its empirical validity.  This paper examines the impact of affirmative action policies on the white male employment and earnings before and after 1972, which marked the implementation of ""hard"" affirmative action measures (goals and timetables).  We find that the white male employment rate did indeed decline after 1972 but that this decline was not sustained.  We also find that the employment rate for women and minorities declined as well.  Earnings for white men increased steadily until mid 1970s and then leveled off.  Time series analysis yields two major findings.  First, when controlling for relevant labor force variables, there is no difference in the pre and post 1972 white male employment rate and employment population ratio.  Second, white male earnings did decline after the implementation of goals and timetables.  Black men and women, however, also experienced a similar decline in earnings.  The authors conclude that in the aggregate, the evidence does not support claims of white male disadvantage due to affirmative action."
0	Concerns about vulnerability heighten as disasters result in increasing societal damage globally. Based on the case of wildfire hazards in Arizona forests, this paper addresses two questions: (1) what influences disaster vulnerability? (2) how can people reduce risks? Like other locales in region, the study area has urbanized as large wildfires have occurred with increasing frequency; these changes have amplified hazards. Management interventions in fire-prone communities assume that unsafe conditions result from inadequate residential knowledge of hazards, yet I find no linkage between hazard perception and exposure. My results reveal that residents accurately perceive risk, and that population growth, amenity values and institutional incentives expose households to practically irremediable hazards. Hazard vulnerability is primarily produced through decision-making within institutions and secondarily by households. These findings address risk management policy in two respects. Programs intended to educate residents about hazards provide a necessary, but not sufficient, basis for reducing hazard vulnerability. The focus on residents must be expanded to include institutional decision-making processes that guide hazardous forms of development.
1	"Although the past decade has witnessed increased usage of ecological data to map the community-level effects of religion, the vast majority of studies in this body of scholarship continue to be plagued by two key shortcomings. First, ecological research on religion is often conducted in an atheoretical manner, one that privileges the structural character of religion while failing to demonstrate sensitivity to the substance Of collectively held religious beliefs and values. Second, ecological scholarship Often employs crude methodological techniques that overlook noteworthy distinctions within large religious collectivities (e.g., variants Of conservative Protestantism, Catholicism and Judaism). This study charts new theoretical and methodological directions in the use of ecological data by exploring the complex linkages between religious ecology and mortality in the United States. We hypothesize that the other-worldly theology and individualistic orientation found in conservative Protestantism dampens this faith traditions commitment to population health, thereby leading to demonstrably different outcomes in mortality by denominational families. Also, drawing on previous work that criticizes the ""monolithic bloc"" depiction Of conservative Protestantism, we hypothesize that important distinctions in mortality will be found when sub-groups of conservative Protestants (evangelicals, Pentecostals and fundamentalists) are compared because each of these factions exhibits distinct degrees of other-worldliness. Using restricted county-level data from the National Center for Health Statistics and 2000 Churches and Church Congregations data, we observe noteworthy religious differences in mortality, thereby underscoring a need for the development of more sophisticated theoretical and methodological approaches to the ecological study of religion. Ecological researchers are encouraged to take seriously the content of collectively held religious beliefs and exhibit sensitivity toward the distinctive worldviews that hold sway within particular faith traditions."
0	In light of greater attention being paid to moral values in the wake of the 2004 Presidential elections, a possible resurgence of the culture wars, and the international growth in moral and/or ideologically-informed phenomena emphasizes the compelling need for sociological explanations addressing why certain forms of moral discourse and understanding become dominant within a given society. Three perspectives that attempt to explain the rise and dominance of certain forms of moral discourse are memetics, the metaphorical reasoning of George Lakoff and moral vocabularies. Memetics contends that memes spread in a pattern analogous to the transmission of specific genes. Lakoff contends that much of recent political discourse appeals to particular dominant metaphorical frames such as the strict father and nurturing parent frames. The moral vocabulary paradigm contends that coherent forms of moral discourse are comprised of differing moral resources whose compatibility with the larger host society reflects the degree to which fragments of the moral vocabulary becomes accepted within the host society. A comparison of these three paradigms is conducted in order to demonstrate the relative explanatory strengths and limitations of each perspective and why particular forms of moral discourse have become dominant within forms of political and moralistic discourse.
1	This research investigates one process through which deviance becomes legitimate and therefore expected of individuals within a group. On the one hand, the status Of an individual initially suggesting deviance affects others' personal beliefs that deviance is proper, and in turn the likelihood that they will enact and transmit deviance to new group members. On the other hand, endorsement of deviance by peers is sufficient to legitimate the behavior. As a result, individuals are more likely to enact and transmit endorsed deviance regardless of propriety. Results of a laboratory experiment, in which a confederate suggests that participants should cheat on a task, indicate that endorsement and status independently affect the likelihood participants cheated and suggested cheating to a new group, but that they do not interact.
0	This paper provides a critique of the ways generation and waves are theorized in recent writing on third wave feminism.  This scholarship shares a common generational narrative about feminism that positions the second wave as those who came of age during the rise of social movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s against the third wave or those who first came to feminism in college in the 1990s.  One account, for instance, conceptualizes generations between feminists as a timeless and universal relationship between mother and daughter.  And, another narrative assumes a linear, progressive understanding of history in the relations between generations.  Here, third wave writers presume that their brand of feminism is more theoretically and politically sophisticated than earlier versions.  By contrast, our intent is to trouble the static figuring of generations by placing emphasis on how feminism moves and develops over time and place.  Drawing from personal narratives from contemporary feminist scholars (graduate students and junior and senior faculty), we use feminist generations as a reference point for the timing of ones entry into graduate school, and feminist waves as a metaphor for the movement and relocation of theories, politics, methods and ways of knowing across time and place.  As we argue, theorizing feminist waves as movement highlights the variations within generational cohorts as well as continuities between them.
1	Women's workforce participation increased strongly over the 1980s and 1990s, especially among middle aged wives. Multivariate analysis of IsssA data (N = 9412) reveals large compositional changes and a trend for succeeding cohorts of women to work more than their predecessors, but few if any period effects. Among the compositional changes, rising women's education and falling fertility substantially elevate women's workforce participation and hours worked. No clear time effects were associated with particular policy initiatives. Importantly, interaction tests suggest that the effects of education and of family situation have not changed over time. Finally, family of origin and religiosity have both direct and indirect effects. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	Huntington Disease (HD) is a hereditary, neurodegenerative disease that affects cognition, mood and motor movements. While only a neurologist can make a diagnosis of HD, there is growing evidence to suggest that the psychiatric aspects of HD are the first symptoms to appear. As such, the HD community occupies a position between the disciplines of neurology and psychiatry. This position between two medical epistemologies may result in the misdiagnosis of HD as a psychiatric illness (e.g., Schizophrenia), as indicated by numerous psychiatric case studies. In contrast to previous work on the misdiagnosis of HD that focus on the perspectives of clinicians, this presentation explores the perceptions of the psychiatric misdiagnosis of HD through the experiences of 15 individuals living with the disease and 7 of their partners. Their encounters with psychiatric misdiagnosis of HD are used to trace what has been called the great divide between neurology and psychiatry. Mikhail Bakhtins concept of speech genres will also be used to discuss the diagnostic genres of neurology and psychiatry, and to highlight the tangible implications that this epistemological divide has for the HD community.
0	This paper is about the social meaning of risk and strategies to reduce the sense of uncertainty in a fluid, globalized world. First the paper attempts to sort out the bundle of meanings assumed by risk, then shows that risk has been an accompanying feature of modernity. It moves on to make the claim that there is still something specific about the increased sense of uncertainty and the proliferation of risk talk under the process we refer to as globalization. Antiglobalizationist social movements react precisely to this predicament and use localization as a risk-reducing strategy. Yet their localization strategies differ left and right. This the paper shows through the analysis of a movement that erupted around food.
1	Symbolic entrapment - which refers to when a person is prevented from taking courses of action because these actions threaten symbolic boundaries that crucially define important and salient social identities - is a ubiquitous part of social life. Previous research suggests that individuals either remain symbolically entrapped or disavow their identities in efforts to escape. By using the case of conservative Christian victims of spousal abuse who divorced their abusive husbands yet remain conservative Christians, I theorize that people escape symbolic entrapment while also maintaining their identities using normative, transforming, and neutralizing vocabularies of motive that make certain courses of action seem appropriate in terms of a group's culture. These motives help individuals escape symbolic entrapment by relieving cognitive dissonance and by providing people with arguments that convince fellow group members of the appropriateness of action. I conclude with empirical, theoretical, and practical implications of this research. Keywords: symbolic entrapment, social identities, vocabularies of motive, intimate partner violence, conservative Christianity.
1	This article seeks to identify the mechanisms underlying the gender wage gap among new lawyers. Relying on nationally representative data to examine the salaries of lawyers working fulltime in private practice, we find a gender gap of about 5 percent. Identifying four mechanisms-work profiles, opportunity paths and structures, credentials, and legal markets-we first estimate how Much of the gap stems from the differential valuation of women's endowments; second, we estimate the effects of different endowments for men and women; and third we assess both these possibilities. The analyses indicate that none of these mechanisms can fully account for the gender gap. Experimental studies that indicate womens work is less valued and rewarded than men's suggest new directions for research on gendered compensation.
1	"In the years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, some 400 local governments passed ""Bill of Rights"" resolutions in opposition to the USA PATRIOT Act. Event history analyses show that cities with progressive profiles were markedly quicker to pass such resolutions. These effects are strongest in the early phase of the Bill of Rights campaign, a period for which there is also robust evidence of contagious influence among nearby cities. The authors argue that the campaign's success lies in the miscibility of multiple movements-the ability of groups with different beliefs, agendas, and traditions to combine around a common goal. The case is used to distinguish between strong and weak forms of miscibility and to develop insight into strategic, organizational, and political conditions that promote the construction of movement-spanning coalitions."
1	This research expands upon organizational ecology theory to examine variations in founding of organizations in the formalized sector of the environmental justice movement across U.S. counties for two time periods (1990-1999 and 2000-2008). Cross-movement effects are examined to determine if founding is more or less likely to occur in counties where related civil rights and environmental organizations are located. Consistent with the notion of agglomeration effects, we hypothesize that during the 1990s the relationship among civil rights density, environmental density, and environmental justice founding is positive and suggests cooperative efforts. That is, environmental justice organizations should form in counties where civil rights organizations and environmental organizations exist. Because the focus of environmental justice organizations may have expanded over time and created a more competitive atmosphere, cross-movement relationships that were positive across counties during the 1990s are hypothesized to turn negative across counties during the 2000s. Multivariate analysis suggests mixed support for these hypotheses. Specifically, civil rights density is positively associated with environmental justice founding during the 1990s and negatively associated with environmental justice founding during the 20005 suggesting potential cooperative and then competitive effects across counties over time. However, the correlations between environmental density and environmental justice founding, while positive and statistically significant during the 1990s, are not statistically significant during the 2000s. Thus, in the case of organizations in the formalized sector of the environmental and environmental justice movements it appears that there is a trend toward competitive effects even as those effects have yet to materialize.
1	The implications of recent weight gain trends for widening social disparities in body weight in the United States are unclear. Using an intersectional approach to studying inequality, and the longitudinal and nationally representative American's Changing Lives study (1986-2001/2002), we examine social disparities in body mass index trajectories during a time of rapid weight gain in the United States. Results reveal complex interactive effects of gender, race, socioeconomic position and age, and provide evidence for increasing social disparities, particularly among younger adults. Most notably, among individuals who aged from 25-39 to 45-54 during the study interval, low-educated and low-income black women experienced the greatest increase in BMI, while high-educated and high-income white men experienced the least BMI growth. These new findings highlight the importance of investigating changing disparities in weight intersectionally, using multiple dimensions of inequality as well as age, and also presage increasing BMI disparities in the U. S. adult population.
1	Previous studies on social integration of immigrants were predominantly of static nature. This article provides a dynamic account by distinguishing differences in social integration that develop shortly after immigrants' arrival in the host country from changes with length of stay. We examine contacts in leisure time between natives and non-western immigrants in the Netherlands. Theories from research on ethnic intermarriage are applied to these more common forms of contact. We use pooled cross-sectional survey data from 1988-2002. The results show that on average social integration increases with length of stay. Ethnicity, migration motive and home country education account for differences in integration that develop shortly after arrival and are maintained or even increased with length of stay, while the size of the immigrant group matters mainly at entry and then loses its influence over time. Age at migration exclusively explains differences in social integration that develop with length of stay. 
0	Noting the urgency for importing organizational/social theories into the embryonic field of academic entrepreneurship, this paper uses sociology of science, sociology of professions and organizational theory to investigate the social structural origin of academic entrepreneurship.  With historical and fieldwork data, it finds two unintended consequences:  (1) To absorb external turbulence, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) established One Academy, Two Systems and assigned scientists to manage enterprises, but this organizational model created internal turbulence, which led to its demise, and consequently, demotion/layoff of the managers.  (2) Although most managers had not planned private entrepreneurship, career blockage pushed them into this career innovation.
0	This paper is intended to consider the reach of Braithwaites theory of reintegrative shaming. I will be particularly concerned with the policy-relevant areas of therapeutic jurisprudence and community policing, and especially as these pertain to shifts in American drug control policy. My findings suggest that, counter to Braithwaites assertion, that reintegrative shaming methods may be difficult to sustain outside of a formalized courts and corrections context.  Drug treatment courts, with their philosophical link to theories of therapeutic jurisprudence, appear better able to incorporate reintegrative shaming strategies that divert offenders into remedial services as an alternative to incarceration. Community policing, in contrast, lacks a commensurate philosophical foundation that encourages offender and citizen outreach, and despite rhetoric about citizen diversion and outreach methods, has become organized primarily around goals of aggressive forms of order maintenance. Moreover, there is political resistance among citizens and other governmental agencies to having the police become involved with reintegrative shaming methods.
1	"We use survey data from A accepted applicants to Teach for America 1993-98 to assess the longer-term effect Of Youth service on participants' current civic attitudes and behaviors. While TFA ""graduates"" score higher than the two comparison groups-""dropouts"" and ""non-matriculants""-on a broad range of attitudinal items measuring civic commitment, these differences appear to be less a byproduct of the TFA experience than a reflection of current involvement with the TFA organization. Moreover, the attitudinal differences are not reflected in actual civic behavior. Specifically, graduates lag behind non-matriculants in current service activity and generally trail both non-matriculauts and drop-OutS in self-reported participation in five other forms of civic/political activity measured in the study. Graduates also vote at lower rates than the other two groups. Finally, fewer graduates report employment in ""pro-social"" jobs than either non-matriculants or drop-outs. We close by speculating on what mechanisms may help explain variation in the long-term effects of youth service or activist experiences."
0	The norm of reciprocity is generally considered robust, but there has been surprisingly little examination of its gender dimension. We present such an analysis, developing theory using longitudinal qualitative data from Russia. We argue that giving is a means of securing social recognition and defining social identity. But identity is gendered, as are the gifts men and women typically give and receive. This is particularly notable in relation to unpaid task assistance. In line with prevailing gender status beliefs, men’s gifts are generally more highly valued, while women’s carry a greater risk of non-reciprocation. We attribute this to three mechanisms. First, women’s unpaid labor is taken-for-granted and is therefore not perceived as a gift. Second, women find it difficult to exit unbalanced relationships because of their sense of duty and the emotional complexity of such entanglements. Finally, gender norms encouraging women’s self-sacrifice trump the norm of reciprocity.
1	Between 1980 and 2000, residential segregation between non-Hispanic whites and blacks, as measured by the index of dissimilarity, declined by 8.7 percentage points. How this decline reflects stable racial integration at the neighborhood level remains to be seen. Using the Neighborhood Change Database, which provides 1980, 1990, and 2000 census-tract level data in 2000 boundaries, the descriptive analyses conducted here reveal three findings. First, the declines found in white-black segregation are due to increases in multiethnic neighborhoods rather than mixed white-and-black neighborhoods. Second, the decline in segregation appears not to be due to the fact that multiethnic neighborhoods are forming and remaining stable over time. Instead it is due to the increase in the number of these neighborhoods at one point in time. Finally, when focusing explicitly on the stability of mixed-race neighborhoods, such neighborhoods are less stable when examined over two decades as compared to one decade. 
1	Theoretical perspectives suggest a strong link between maternal mental health and parenting which may facilitate the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage from depressed mothers to their children In this paper I extend prior research by using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3659) Pooled OLS and random-effects regression models document a strong link between maternal depression and the following parenting behaviors neglect psychological aggression physical assault and engagement Fixed-effects models however show little evidence that changes in maternal depression are linked to changes in parenting behaviors suggesting some negative consequences of depression are driven by variation across individuals or unobserved time-invariant characteristics Further, the consequences of depression for parenting behaviors do not vary by mother s marital status suggesting that marriage may not be protective with respect to the parenting behaviors of depressed mothers 
0	In this paper, we examine how returns to education and skill change over time for workers who enter the labor market at roughly the same time period.  We are primarily interested in differences in earnings growth for workers with different education and skill levels.  Our findings indicate that more educated workers earn slightly more than less educated workers when they enter the labor market.  However, college educated workers enjoy substantially greater earnings growth over time relative to less educated workers.  In addition, we find that structural factors, such as union membership and occupational skill demands, account for much of the variation in earnings trajectories.  Moreover, educational is also related to the likelihood of experiencing an income decrease.
0	Higher-status occupations, like professionals or managers, are traditionally regarded as high-paying jobs with abundant resources, prestige and privilege. However, recently, scholars found that higher-status people are more likely to internalize the organization culture and rules and as a result, tend to report more job involvement and commitment, long work hours and job overload. These workplace demands attached to the higher status further produce stress-related mental health. The paradoxical characteristics of occupation are summarized in Stress of Higher Status hypothesis and resource of higher status hypothesis. The current study aims to test these two hypotheses by examining the suppression effects of workplace demands and the mediating effects of work resources between occupation, education and perceived stress; it also expands the hypotheses by investigate the moderator role of gender in the processes. For this purpose, 2008 National Study of Changing Workforce dataset was adopted and Markov Chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation technique was applied. Results of stepwise OLS regression mostly support Stress of Higher Status hypothesis: job overload and work-to-family conflict suppress the association between occupation, education and perceived stress while working overtime does not. The moderator influence of gender is also revealed with some complexities. The findings of this study facilitate the understanding of stress process and interaction between social status, workplace and health outcomes.
1	Even though serial cohabitation is on the rise, it has not been integrated into recent family research. We analyze the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) cycle 6 to explore the relationship context of serial cohabitation for women throughout emerging adulthood (N = 3397). We provide a relationship context for serial cohabitation by examining the age at first cohabitation, duration of cohabiting unions, marital expectations and transitions, as well as premarital sexual histories. Furthermore, we examine the change in these relationship indicators across women's birth cohorts. We find that serial cohabitors' co-residential unions are about the same duration as single-instance cohabiting unions. Serial cohabitors start cohabiting younger, report lower marital expectations than single-instance cohabitors and a smaller proportion marry before age 30. Women who have more premarital sex partners have significantly greater odds of serial cohabiting. These findings indicate that women face increasingly complex relationship trajectories during emerging adulthood. 
1	Genetic and other biological explanations have reemerged in recent scholarship on the underrepresentation of women in mathematics and the sciences. This study engages this debate by using international data-including math achievement scores from the Third International Mathematics and Sciences Study and country-level data from the World Bank, the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the World Values Survey, and the International Social Survey Programme-to demonstrate the importance of social factors and to estimate an upper bound for the impact of genetic factors. The author argues that international variation provides a valuable opportunity to present simple and powerful arguments for the continued importance of social factors. In addition, where previous research has, by and large, focused on differences in population means, this work examines gender differences throughout the distribution. The article shows that there is considerable variation in gender differences internationally, a finding not easily explained by strictly biological theories. Modeling the cross-national variation in gender differences with country-level predictors reveals that differences among high achievers are related to gender inequality in the labor market and differences in the overall status of men and women.
1	"How do animals become problems? Drawing on interactionist theories of social problems and cultural geography, I argue that the construction of animals as problems relies upon cultural understandings of nature/culture relationships, which in turn entail ""imaginative geographies."" Specifically, modernity posits a firm boundary between nature and culture. Animals have their place, but are experienced as ""out of place""-and often problematic-when they are perceived to transgress spaces designated for human habitation. Relying on New York Times articles from 1851 to 2006, and articles from 51 other newspapers from 1980 to 2006, this article focuses on the process by which pigeons as a species were problematized. I contend that pigeons have come to represent the antithesis of the ideal metropolis, which is orderly and sanitized, with nature subdued and compartmentalized. While typified as a health issue, the pigeon's primary ""offense"" is that it ""pollutes"" habitats dedicated for human use. The catch phrase ""rats with wings"" neatly summarizes society's evaluations of, and anxieties about, this bird. This metaphor reflects a framing of pigeons by claims-makers that renders them out of place in the cityscape. This study expands social problems theorizing to more thoroughly account for animals and the role of space."
1	How and why do movements transition from everyday resistance to overt collective action? This article examines this question taking repressive environments and threat as an important case in point. Drawing on primary and secondary data sources, I offer comparative insights on resistance group dynamics and perceptions of threat in three Nazi death camps-Sobibor, Treblinka, and Auschwitz-between 1941 and 1945. Prisoners formed resistance groups at each camp, but collective revolt occurred in only certain cases: when the collective perception of threat at a given camp was viewed as both immediate and lethal. The interpretation of changing, threatening conditions, and an understanding of structural and interactional opportunities for group identity and tactical strategizing, are vital for understanding collective action in repressive environments. I conclude by discussing these lessons pertaining to threat and their implications for repressive contexts and broader social movement theorizing.
1	"This article presents a new model of culture in action. Although most sociologists who study culture emphasize its role in post hoc sense making, sociologists of religion and social psychologists tend to focus on the role beliefs play in motivation. The dual-process model integrates justificatory and motivational approaches by distinguishing between ""discursive"" and ""practical"" modes of culture and cognition. The author uses panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to illustrate the model's usefulness. Consistent with its predictions, he finds that though respondents cannot articulate clear principles of moral judgment, their choice from a list of moral-cultural scripts strongly predicts later behavior."
1	This study tackles the question to what extent the composition of protest events is determined by the stance of governments. Established contextual theories do not formulate propositions on how context affects individual protesters. The article engages in empirically testing whether the macro-context affects the internal diversity of the crowds that took to the streets on Feb. 15 2003, the massive day of protest against the upcoming war or; Iraq. Drawing on a survey of 6,753 individual demonstrators in eight countries, we find that the composition of the marches is determined by the stance of the government and the opposition in the countries at stake. Apart from government stance, also the support in public opinion and the type of mobilization (media support) matter for internal diversity.
1	This article builds on social movement theory to explain ideological variation among socialist, social democratic, and labor parties across 18 countries in the early twentieth century. We propose a causal argument connecting (1) the political emergence of the bourgeoisie and its middle-class allies to (2) the political space for labor unions and working-class parties, which (3) provided a setting for internal pressures and external opportunities that shaped socialist party ideology. Combining quantitative analysis and case studies, we find that the timing of civil liberties and the strength of socialist links with labor unions were decisive for reformism or radicalism. Refining Lipset's prior analysis, we qualify his claim that male suffrage provides a key to socialist orientation.
0	This paper proposes a theoretical framework for understanding emergent disciplines as knowledge-focused social movement phenomena called New Knowledge Movements, or NKMs. The proposed theoretical framework is developed through a synthesis of new social movement theory and Frickel and Grosss Scientific/Intellectual Movements (SIMs) model. In contrast to the SIMs model, this paper argues that many new disciplines emerge through contentious collective action on the part of political and intellectual outsiders rather than through the action of intellectual elites. The framework is demonstrated and tested through a narrative exploration based on secondary sources and scholar-activist tests of the emergence of two disciplines, womens studies and Asian American studies, in the United States. Suggestions for future applications are provided.
0	Much of the previous work on gentrification has focused on the gentrifiers and their patterns of consumption. Previous work has also identified gentrifiers as a widely varying group, unable to be defined by sexual preference, income, education, ethnicity or occupation.  For example, while some case studies document gentrifiers as young artists in need of loft space, others portray gentrifiers as higher income couples restoring historical structures. In addition, many previous scholars have attributed gentrification to lifestyle preferences and land-use dynamics  economic motives at base.  In this paper, I present evidence for the theory that modern gentrifiers, specifically those who participate in neighborhood turnover in its early stages, are best defined by their stage in the life cycle: an extended period of early adulthood after college but before family rearing.  Such an approach allows one to contextualize economic decision making within a life course framework that may account for certain consumption patterns, household income, and lifestyle preferences. Findings are based on in-depth interviews with a randomly chosen sample of in-movers in one gentrified neighborhood in Chicago.
0	Focusing on methodological debates around histories of slavery, race/ethnicity and sexuality in the Atlantic world, this paper examines the 'silencing of the past' (Trouillot 1995) and the work of 're-memory' within the writing and representation of post-slavery history and heritage. How are subaltern subjects who are barred from political personhood (and illegitimate topics that are barred from being spoken of) made present within academic, legal and other official discourses? Or has there been a wholesale deconstruction of historiographic practice by those whom it has traditionally excluded? This paper offers an overview of how historical methods in and on the terrain of the Caribbean are breaking from three different perspectives. First traditional methods are breaking down under the weight of new epistemological perspectives (including feminist research methods) and post-disciplinary approaches to the production of knowledge. Secondly, breaks or silences, forgotten memories and re-created pasts, are being written into Caribbean histories and being recognized through acts of commemoration. And thirdly new practitioners and voices are breaking into history as a disciplinary field, not only stealing its claims to authority, but also polluting it with new materials and perspectives that challenge its gender, class and racial orthodoxies through practices including oraliteracy and the foregrounding of erotic autonomy. Historical and comparative sociology has yet to respond to these fundamental challenges to mainstream methodologies, and the most advanced work in these areas continues to come from interdisciplinary arenas such as Caribbean Studies and Women's and Gender Studies.
0	Feminists have produced important scholarly work centered on womens bodies, yet the economic dimension of the body has been underexplored. I examine the relationships between womens bodily experiences and broad socio-economic processes; namely, the neoliberal policies that were applied in Argentina and the crisis that erupted in 2001. Disembodied economic analyses hide the extent to which economic crises drain womens bodily resources. But the bodies of many women in Argentina have been increasingly exhausted, stressed, neglected, and wounded as a result of adverse economic conditions. Economic processes leave marks on womens bodies, emotions, and consciousness, and gender and class locations structure such experiences, and how different women weather economic crises. This paper draws on and contributes to the literature on sociology of the body, feminist theory, and women in Latin America, and it is based on the results of a fourteen-month qualitative research carried out in Argentina during 2002-2003. This study combines ethnographic observations; in-depth interviews with 50 women, and 4 focus groups with women with different social statuses. Womens narratives of their embodied experiences of the crisis provide a window from which to learn about social suffering, resiliency, and resistance. As life deteriorates because of economic problems, womens relatively invisible bodies have come to the fore as workers, community organizers, mothers, volunteers, professionals, and in many more capacities. They appear not only in the form of suffering bodies, but also as bodies of resistance and renewal.
0	Gentrification is a contentious issue in many U.S. cities, especially when it involves racial turnover; whites moving into previously segregated black neighborhoods leads to concern over the diminishing black community. The black community is discussed in the context of structural racial inequality. Racial boundaries are discussed as social processes of identifying with the neighborhood and ones racial group. We examine the attitudes and opinions of neighborhood change among residents of the newly named Alberta Arts District in Portland, OR, distinguishing between long-time black and white residents, homeowners and renters. Survey results demonstrate racial and tenure status differences in general opinions of change. Interviews reveal that the meaning of this change for long-time black residents is profoundly related to race and the diminishing black community. Despite the property value increases experienced by many long-time homeowners, race remains the most meaningful aspect of change among long-time black residents. Homeownership in this gentrifying neighborhood does not diminish concern over the diminishing black community. These findings demonstrate the continuing prominence and of race as a structuring category of American urban life, and the continuing importance of the black community as a source of identity.
0	This paper argues that by analyzing state repression along with other state strategies such as facilitation in its various forms (e.g., political parties & political process, social aid, employment, and the military), we will better understand the more permanent and on-going role of the state in the hindering of contentious behavior. Nationalist types of social movements in unequal national contexts whose grievances are not met are ideal for measuring changes in state strategy overtime. The U.S. power, for example, is not solely dependent on the selective use of coercion to challengers to its authority, but entire populations are subjected to a combination of state strategies that are more pervasive and hegemonic. Although this paper offers an incomplete answer to the conceptual flaws that elevates state repression above all other state interventions, this paper highlights the more subtle and penetrated role states play in the prevention of mobilization. The Puerto Rican case is utilized in an attempt to move beyond fragmented analysis to include an array of state strategies that are active even in non-contentious periods.
1	Using a hazards framework and panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey Of Youth (1979-2004), we analyze the fertility patterns of a recent cohort of white and black women in the United States. We examine how completed fertility varies by women's education, differentiating between intended and unintended births. We find that the education gradient on fertility comes largely from unintended childbearing, and it is not explained by child-bearing desires or opportunity costs, the two most common explanations in previous research. Less-educated women want no more children than die more educated, so this factor explains none of their higher completed fertility. Less-educated women have lower wages, but wages have little of the negative effect on fertility predicted by economic theories of opportunity cost. We propose three other potential mechanisms linking low education and unintended childbearing, focusing on access to contraception and abortion, relational and economic uncertainty, and consistency in the behaviors necessary to avoid unintended pregnancies. Our work highlights the need to incorporate these mechanisms into future research.
1	This article analyzes race-targeted policy in Brazil as both a political stake and a powerful instrument in an unfolding classificatory struggle over the definition of racial boundaries. The Brazilian state traditionally embraced mixed-race classification, but is adopting racial quotas employing a black/ white scheme. To explore potential consequences of that turn for beneficiary identification and boundary formation, the author analyzes attitudinal survey data on race-targeted policy and racial classification in multiple formats, including classification in comparison to photographs. The results show that almost half of the mixed-race sample, when constrained to dichotomous classification, opts for whiteness, a majority rejects mixed-race individuals for quotas, and the mention of quotas for blacks in a split-ballot experiment nearly doubles the percentage choosing that racial category. Theories of how states make race emphasize the use of official categories to legislate exclusion. In contrast, analysis of the Brazilian case illuminates how states may also make race through policies of official inclusion.
1	More than one out of every five principals leaves their school each year. In some cases, these career changes are driven by the choices of district leadership. In other cases, principals initiate the move, often demonstrating preferences to work in schools with higher achieving students from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Principals often use schools with many poor or low-achieving students as stepping stones to what they view as more desirable assignments. We use longitudinal data from one large urban school district to study the relationship between principal turnover and school outcomes. We find that principal turnover is, on average, detrimental to school performance. Frequent turnover of school leadership results in lower teacher retention and lower student achievement gains. Leadership changes are particularly harmful for high poverty schools, low-achieving schools, and schools with many inexperienced teachers. These schools not only suffer from high rates of principal turnover but are also unable to attract experienced successors. The negative effect of leadership changes can be mitigated when vacancies are filled by individuals with prior experience leading other schools. However, the majority of new principals in high poverty and low-performing schools lack prior leadership experience and leave when more attractive positions become available in other schools. 
1	"The social and political integration of Muslim immigrants into Western societies is among the most pressing problems of today. Research documents how immigrant communities are increasing v under pressure to assimilate to their ""host"" societies in the face of significant discrimination. In this article, we bring together two literatures-that on immigrants and that on social movement participation-to explore whether Muslim immigrants respond to their societal situation by engaging in collective political action. Although neither literature has given much attention to immigrant collective action, they do provide predictive leverage relative to the influence of grievances, efficacy, identity, emotions, and embeddedness in civil society networks. Our analyses are comprised of three separate but identical studies: a study of Turkish (N = 126) and Moroccan immigrants (N = 80) in the Netherlands and a study of Turkish immigrants (N = 100) in New York. Results suggest that social psychological mechanisms known to affect native citizens' collective action function similarly for immigrants to a great extent, although certain immigrant patterns are indeed unique."
0	This paper argues that there is much within group ideological and practical variation among gentrifiers, and that a narrow focus on gentrifications outcomes has encouraged over-emphasis of the urban pioneer who seeks economic and status benefits from the restoration of the central city.   While the desire to purchase an affordable home is a draw for gentrifiers of every ilk, most cite this as one of multiple motivations for their move. The motivations for their relocation, experience of their place of residence, and practices are expansive. Gentrifiers celebrate diverse features of their place of residence, and have different attitudes about gentrification and old-timers.  This ideological variation is of import, for gentrifiers appreciation for certain local attributes contributes to their vision of the future of a place and shapes their practices, particularly their relationship to old-timers.
1	"The ""new immigration"", including substantial Asian immigration to North America, has revived questions about racial and ethnic minority group integration in predominantly European-origin societies. This study offers a new comparison of US and Canadian Asian integration using intermarriage as the indicator of integration. Results reveal more similarities than differences. Intermarriage variations by age, gender, education, immigrant generation, Asian ethnic group, and other sociodemographic characteristics are generally similar and consistent with previous research using US data. Multivariate results highlight similarities and the significance of immigrant generation, gender, and Asian ethnicity on Asian intermarriage in both countries. The main difference is lower overall Asian exogamy in Canada, reflecting country differences in the demographic history, composition, and distribution of the Asian populations. We conclude that exogamy is likely to continue to increase in both Canada and the US, and represents a key measure of the social integration of Asians in both countries. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1	We use a model of continuous attachments in networks to generate propositions concerning inequalities in network structures, and test the propositions on data from organizational settings. Our network model, inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality, reciprocity, and attachment resistance are the most important elements in the network members' choices. 
1	"Male and female undergraduates (N = 240) participated in opposite-sex dyads and worked on a computerized visual task presented as ""masculine."" Participants in the eight experimental conditions received either higher or lower scores than their partner; this phase was omitted in the two control conditions. In turn, half of the experimental groups received universal competence-standards from the experimenter, while the other half set standards by themselves. In the second phase, the two persons worked on the task as a team. The central hypothesis is that subject-generated standards will favor the men, and that this will result in the women being perceived as having less competence even if achieving the same performance-level as men: this inequality is predicted to no longer be maintained in the groups with experimenter-set standards. Measures include rejection of influence, perceived ability in self and partner, and level of acceptance of both the stated sex-linkage of the task and the experimenter-set standard. Results and their interpretation are presented and discussed in detail. "
0	In this paper, I examine the role that children have to play in the creation of social capital for their parents. While social capital theorists have noted the benefits children can accrue through their parents’ social connections (their social capital), little work has been done tracing the reciprocal flow of said benefits through connections. I will show how participation in youth sports can provide for access to resources for their parents. In the Valley City Little League, a child-centered voluntary organization, parents bring their children to ostensibly play baseball, learn life skills, and acquire valuable socialization skills. Along the way, they embed themselves in a network of people with similar aspirations for their own children. Through various league mechanisms, parents can gain valuable social capital through ties of varying strength. Through their children’s specific friendship choices, their own closer relationships are also subtly steered. Both mechanisms and types of benefits will be discussed.
1	Social exchange theories have identified social structural factors and interaction processes that build cohesion through the everyday exchange of valued resources. However, the types of resources considered in previous research do not reflect the properties of many commonly exchanged resources, namely information, social support, and material goods. In this article, I identify two resource dimensions that underlie and affect exchange: (1) duplicability, that is, whether a resource provider retains control of the resource after exchange and (2) transferability, that is, whether a resource recipient can exchange the resource in another relation. I present a causal model to explain how these dimensions affect cohesion through the mediating effects of structural power exchange frequency. and uncertainty. Notably, resource variation alters the source of structural power, making it necessary to specify when different power mechanisms will operate and their disparate effects on the other mediating factors. A laboratory experiment provides support for the causal model. Resource characteristics fundamentally shape both the exchange process and the outcomes actors experience.
0	The sociology of religion is a hot field once again, mainly due to the fresh blood provided by a handful of scholars -- most of whom rational choice theorists -- whose work is tipped to be a new paradigm. This paper attempts to evaluate this new paradigm. After delineating its main features and assessing its strengths over the older work in the field, it puts the new paradigm in social and historical context. It outlines the conditions of its possibility by reading its history against the history of social movement scholarship in the United States. Although the new paradigm represents a significant progress over older sociological theories of religion, it has several important shortcomings that historical parallels with social movements theories will begin to reveal. Next, a fuller critique of the new paradigm is developed. It is argued that it owes much of its success to its rhetoric and that it is not as rigorous and parsimonious as its proponents believe it to be.
0	This research examines the role of family background variables in the determination of educational attainment in Denmark. A categorical representation of the highest level of education attained is the dependent variable. It is analyzed by procedures which take account of the presence of unobservable factors. Parent's education and occupation along with a an indicator of ability which is represented by a set of intelligence tests explain a small but significant portion of the variation in their children's' educational success. Women are shown to respond differently to their environments than men and including intelligence test scores does not remove the need to deal with unmeasured attributes. This study examines the determinants of educational attainment of a sample of Danish students who were fourteen in 1968 and who participated in the 1968 Danish Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Attention focuses on factors involving the respondent's social and economic background and the occupational and educational characteristics of the respondent's parents.The paper has the following format. Introduction. The next section provides a brief review of the literature on educational attainments as well as some of the statistical procedures that have been used in its analysis. In section 3 Danish educational attainment data is analyzed using both ordered and unordered probability models model which are estimated by procedures which take into account the presence of unobservable factors. Our procedures are in the spirit of the work of Cameron and Heckman (1998), but are more general. Econometric issues and the results of what other Scandinavian researchers in this area have found are also discussed in section 4.
1	In this study we bring together two sociological traditions: experimental research on how different forms of exchange affect attachments to partners and relationships, and organizational research in natural settings on how embeddedness contributes to social capital. We conceptualize embeddedness in terms of the underlying forms of exchange-negotiated and reciprocal-that are associated with economic exchanges and the social relationships in which they are embedded. Building upon the reciprocity theory of social exchange, we test predictions of how relationship histories (i.e., different sequences of the two forms of exchange) and relationship contexts (i.e., embedding one form of exchange within an ongoing relation of the other form) modify effects of each form in isolation. Results from two experiments show that the reciprocal form of exchange, independent of close ties or personal associations, is critical for producing the strong trust and affective bonds typically associated with embedded relationships. A history or context of reciprocal exchange significantly boosts integrative bonds for negotiated exchange, whereas a history or context of negotiated exchange dampens integrative bonds for reciprocal exchange only moderately. The relative effects of history and context vary by actors' positions of power.
0	Past research on environmental risk perceptions has documented what has come to be known as the “white male” effect, whereby white males are more accepting of a wide range of technological and environmental risks than are other adults.  Most scholars in this literature offer sociopolitical explanations for this phenomenon.  We extend this scholarship by focusing in depth on beliefs and attitudes about a pressing global environmental risk: climate change.  Building upon recent attempts to clarify sociopolitical explanations of the white male effect, we examine how the climate change beliefs and attitudes of conservative white males compare with those of other adults.  We find a significant influence of a “conservative white male” effect—using a three-way interaction term—on four dimensions of climate change denial: (a) knowledge about climate change; (b) belief about the scientific consensus; (c) concern about climate change; and (d) climate policy preferences.  Briefly, our “conservative white male” interaction term remained significant in most models explaining climate change denial, even controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, gender, and those of eight other relevant social, political, and demographic variables.  Conservative white males are a significant source of climate change denial in the American public.
1	How can a nominal descriptive term acquire status beliefs and definitions giving it connotations of differential social worth and competence? Cecilia L. Ridgeway and her associates have developed one theory explaining such effects. Recently Joseph Berger and Hamit Fisek offered a new theory using different mechanisms. We report the first experimental tests of the new theory. One mechanism describes spread of status value through referent individuals who possess both nominal and status characteristics. A second mechanism predicts spread of status value directly from status elements including education and income, without intervening referent actors. Results show that both mechanisms can create positive and negative status value for a nominal characteristic as predicted. 
0	This paper is an endeavor to conceptualize ethnic identity as an important arena for the construction of whiteness and collective identity among American practitioners of Germanic Heathenry. It explores how members whiteness lends to an ethnicity that is negated by its invisibility to color blind American society. In addition, it explores how members respond by the co-construction of their own ethnic folkway, which is not without its quandaries, disagreements, and complexities. Analysis into Heathenry demonstrates how people can construct and render meaningful a holistic, though largely imagined ethnicity, without the utility of direct experience with the foundation on which their identity is based. I divide the discussion into how Heathens collectively construct, maintain, and negotiate group boundaries, culture and identity.  In addition, I respond to previous illustrations of Heathenry as a platform for racism and White Supremacy. Because the issues of ethnicity, race, and racism are inseparable, this paper will address all three, highlighting the intricacy of invented/constructed white ethnicities unexamined in previous empirical representations of Heathenry.
0	Investigating a rural Peruvian village, this paper looks at how a push to privatize peasant lands resulted in the demise of a longstanding popular movement based in the local Evangelical Church.  I found that Evangelism fell from predominance because the elite cabal of peasants seeking privatization, in their general onslaught against the community, inadvertently hijacked the main pillars of the Church and used them to further the land titling cause.  Specifically, because the Church relied so heavily for its own existence on the emotional devotion of its practitioners, it gave believers no defense, beyond heavy prayer, against direct assault.  Given this vulnerability, the tactics which ended up convincing the masses to join privatization were some of the main reasons people joined and stayed with the Church.  Against the privatization onslaught, the Church could no longer provide peace and deliver people from fear, as it had up until this point.  Instead, peoples yearnings for these twin desires, heightened due to the intense land titling battle itself, were only capable of being fulfilled through acquiescing to the privatization cabal.  With such a turn, the pre-millenarian doctrine, which had previously allowed people to improve their daily lives, now justified abandoning the pain of worldly issues and focusing exclusively on the ethereal.
1	"From 1980 to 2000, child labor rates across the world fell by more than a quarter. Much of the explanation for this decrease resides in development processes broadly associated with the demographic transition. Net of these internal dynamics, however, globalization may also have played a role. Previous studies have examined the effect of trade and investment flows on child labor rates. However, the impact of cultural models spread by world polity institutions has yet to be examined. In this study, I argue that international organizations have confronted child labor practices, diffusing a ""labor-to-schooling"" model of child development. Analyzing an unbalanced dataset with 428 observations from 116 states across four waves during the 1980-2000 period, I assess the impact of economic and cultural globalization on a state's child labor rate using random effects tobit models. Net of a country's development experience, I find that foreign investment exerts a small, positive effect on child labor, while international organizations exert a larger negative effect. These results are robust to a number of specifications, including first-difference models that restrict attention to longitudinal variation."
1	Although the positive association between religiosity and life satisfaction is well documented, much theoretical and empirical controversy surrounds the question of how religion actually shapes life satisfaction. Using a new panel dataset, this study offers strong evidence for social and participatory mechanisms shaping religion's impact on life satisfaction. Our findings suggest that religious people are more satisfied with their lives because they regularly attend religious services and build social networks in their congregations. The effect of within-congregation friendship is contingent, however, on the presence of a strong religious identity. We find little evidence that other private or subjective aspects of religiosity affect life satisfaction independent of attendance and congregational friendship.
1	This analysis extends prior research on labor market conditions and violent crime. Specifically, we elaborate on research demonstrating a link between poor labor market conditions and violence by directly measuring the associations between secondary sector work, low hour work, low pay work, and levels of violence across the metro-non metro divide. The results demonstrate that low paying work tends to be more similar to other forms of social disadvantage such as poverty and unemployment. In contrast, secondary sector work and low hour work are empirically distinct constructs. Consistent with prior research, multivariate analyses indicate that the pernicious effect of secondary sector work is relatively constant across metro and nonmetro areas. However, contrary to the logic articulated in previous studies, we find that an index of low hour and seasonal employment is actually associated with lower violent crime rates across the metro-nonmetro divide. This finding is consonant with the assertion that the availability of low hour and seasonal employment-work that is often viewed as less than optimal-provides downward pressure on crime rates because it structures ecological behavior patterns and enhances attachments to institutions Cultivating conventional behavior. 
1	Using a panel of states between 1975 and 2005, I examine the relationship between the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and abortion. Results suggest that increases in the EITC are associated with reductions in the overall abortion rate. Specifically, a $1000 increase in the maximum credit is associated with a 7.6% decrease in the overall abortion rate. This effect implies a reduction of approximately 1.6 abortions per 1000 women of childbearing age. I also provide evidence that the reduction in abortions is attributable to a drop in pregnancies, not an increase in the number of births. In other words, women appear to respond to increases in EITC generosity by altering sexual behavior, rather than shifting abortion-birth decisions after a pregnancy occurs. 
1	This research examines the relationship between disabilities in families and returns to welfare. Past studies of welfare recidivism have long theorized that disabilities played a central role in returns to welfare among former recipients, but lacked data to test the hypothesis. Hypothesis tests support the theory that both child and maternal disabilities, which act as barriers to self-sufficiency, increase rates of TANF re-entry and SSI entry. We show that because past studies did not account for disabilities on the odds of returning to welfare, effects of work, number of children, and past receipt of TANF are somewhat overstated. Our findings add to the literature on welfare recidivism and have implications for welfare reforms that emphasize work and lifetime limits on benefits. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	While a substantial proportion of students delay entry into higher education, sociologists are only beginning to understand the consequences of this phenomenon for educational attainment. Previous studies have reported a negative relationship between delayed entry and degree completion, but they have not been able to explain it with a range of students' background characteristics. Results from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1997 indicate that life course transitions, including work, marriage/cohabitation and parenthood, make a unique contribution to explaining this relationship. Adding life course transitions to the models that already control for a range of background characteristics helps to explain the negative relationship between delayed entry and degree completion. These findings have implications for studying educational success in higher education and understanding the process of educational attainment more broadly.
1	"Much research has shown human rights treaties to be ineffective or even counterproductive, often contributing to greater levels of abuse among countries that ratify them. This article reevaluates the effect of four core human rights treaties on a variety of human rights outcomes. Unlike previous studies, it disaggregates treaty membership to examine the effect of relatively ""stronger"" and ""weaker"" commitments. Two-stage regression analyses that control for the endogeneity of treaty membership show that stronger commitments in the form of optional provisions that allow states and individuals to complain about human rights abuses are often associated with improved practices. The article discusses the scholarly and practical implications of these findings."
0	Memetics has long been viewed as a quasi-discipline, as something good for light paper-back reading, or an interesting article in the New York Times, but lacking in true academic muscle.  It is the purpose of this paper to not only briefly demonstrate the failings of the field of memetics as it exists today (for these have espoused to near exhaustion by others) but also, and more importantly, begin a dialogue highlighting the positive aspects of the theory and present ways which sociologists can and should be looking to incorporate them into our own work.  It is important to note that my goal here is to facilitate a dialogue for the betterment of sociology by bringing to light areas where we could learn from memetics.  I am in no way suggesting that memetics is the wave of the future while sociology is a thing of the past.  What I am suggesting is that memes can be useful tools for exploring social issues and social change.
0	Researchers have described a continuum of American drug policy positions that include strict prohibition, medicalization, treatment alternatives to incarceration, harm reduction, and legalization. Many policy makers have called for a public health approach to drug policy that focuses on the need for treatment alternatives to incarceration, prevention, and activities that reduce the social consequences of drug abuse. Using a national sample of Public Health Agencies surrounding schools participating in the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study, we examined local PHA involvement in (1) advocacy for alternative drug policies and prevention activities, (2) actual involvement in such alternatives, and (3) variance in reported advocacy and involvement by community socio-demographics. Descriptive and multivariate analysis shows that many local PHAs are actively participating drug policy alternatives, either through advocacy or service provision. The majority of such participation focuses on prevention efforts. However, there may be a sufficient proportion of local PHAs that are involved in illicit drug-related policy alternatives such as treatment diversion and needle exchange to provide a base for developing public health alternatives for current criminal justice deterrence policies. This is particularly true in communities with the highest need for such policies and services, including African American and urban communities.
1	The United States criminal justice and welfare systems are two important government institutions in the lives of the poor. Despite many theoretical discussions about their relationship, their operation at the level of offenders and families remains poorly understood. This paper utilizes Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing data to examine how recent paternal incarceration is associated with families' receipt of TANF, food stamps, and Medicaid/SCHIP. Results robust to multiple tests find that incarceration is not related to subsequent TANF receipt but is significantly associated with increased receipt of food stamps and Medicaid/SCHIP. The findings suggest that greater government involvement among poor families is an unexpected consequence of mass imprisonment; however, increased participation does not include TANF - the cash assistance program of most concern to theorists.
0	An emerging body of work has examined the impact of discrimination on mental health.  Several of these studies, however, are limited by the inability to establish causality between self-reported discrimination and mental health, as this relationship is confounded by several sources of endogeneity.  This paper employs the counterfactual framework and propensity score matching techniques to assess the causal impact of self-reported discrimination on stress, depression, and anxiety. I find that using this robust statistical technique that discrimination is associated with elevated scores on all dimensions.  Further, I assess the potential differential impact of discrimination by the propensity to report discrimination. I find that while all groups are negatively impacted by discrimination, the magnitude of the impact is largest among persons with both the highest and the lowest propensities to report discrimination.
0	While advances in science and technology have made neonatology a rising field in medicine, sociological studies of neonatal intensive care units (NICU) have been limited mainly to issues of bioethics and responsibility.  This paper applies a social control framework to the NICU experience, extended beyond the usual focus on doctor-patient relationships.  In doing so, it is demonstrated that health professionals and time spent in the hospital have the potential to influence decisions made by mothers regarding how they will feed their infant.  Conflicting needs, abstract notions of personhood, and the current widespread trend supporting breastfeeding as a primary means of infant nutrition can all impact a mothers decision as she considers expectations for good mothering against a backdrop of critical care.
1	This article examines the transition to adulthood among 1.5-generation undocumented Latino young adults. For them, the transition to adulthood involves exiting the legally protected status of K to 12 students and entering into adult roles that require legal status as the basis for participation. This collision among contexts makes for a turbulent transition and has profound implications for identity formation, friendship patterns, aspirations and expectations, and social and economic mobility. Undocumented children move from protected to unprotected, from inclusion to exclusion, from de facto legal to illegal. In the process, they must learn to be illegal, a transformation that involves the almost complete retooling of daily routines, survival skills, aspirations, and social patterns. These findings have important implications for studies of the 1.5- and second-generations and the specific and complex ways in which legal status intervenes in their coming of age. The article draws on 150 interviews with undocumented 1.5-generation young adult Latinos in Southern California.
1	Researchers have established that individual religiosity influences abortion attitudes, and that abortion attitudes, in turn, shape abortion restrictions and access. Less clear is whether religion and abortion structural constraints influence abortion decisions. This study examines the several individual, contextual, and structural factors that could shape the abortion decisions of women who conceive before marriage. Special attention is given to the importance of academic aspirations and structural constraints, in contrast to religious beliefs and county religious context, for making an abortion decision. Hierarchical modeling techniques and two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) are employed. Neither generic religiosity nor conservative Protestant religious context appear to influence women's abortion decisions. Conversely, young women's abortion decisions are shaped by academic ambition, identification with a conservative Protestant denomination, proximity to an abortion clinic and the level of public abortion funding in their county of residence.

0	Over the last thirty years, men and women’s wages have converged, but at ever slower rates. We argue that this stagnation is due, in part, to the concomitant trend toward long work hours, especially in the professions and other “greedy occupations.” Rising expectations about work hours disadvantage women, whose greater familial responsibilities limit their ability to put in long work hours; moreover, because long work hours are most common in occupations at the top of the hourly wage distribution, the trend toward long work hours exacerbates the gender gap in wages. By applying a formal wage decomposition model to CPS data from 1979 to 2009, we show that the gender gap in working 50 hours or more per week has remained largely unchanged over the past 30 years, but the hourly wage premium for “overwork” has increased substantially. This price change effect contributed to stagnation in the gender gap in pay, partially offsetting well-known demographic and social forces that equalized men and women’s pay.
0	The United States Mexico border region shares a variety of health problems including tuberculosis, HIV, binationally mobile patients, and poor access to health services.  Since the early 1990s Mexican and US organizations and professionals have increasingly come in contact with each other through cross-border meetings, training programs, and joint projects.  Health organization membership(s) and a public health interest in populations or diseases in the US Mexico border region coalesce hundreds of organizations and thousands of professionals into a binational organizational field I call border health.  I study the interorganizational relationships within this field and find that interorganizational networks and interorganizational hierarchy characterize border health.  I show how network-broker organizations (NBOs) construct interorganizational networks as both logical and moral thus creating a rational myth that justifies their own organizational existence.  I then explain how coercive isomorphic processes function through interorganizational and national hierarchical structures to reproduce interorganizational networks throughout the border health field.  Finally, I examine how professional networks establish trust within hierarchical interorganizational networks by distancing themselves from the hierarchies in which they are embedded.  Using the border health case I argue that interorganizational networks and interorganizational hierarchies can be tightly intertwined and interdependent organizational forms.
0	The last few years have seen a rapid growth in sociological research on health movements.  This developing field of study brings together insights from medical sociology, sociology of science, and social movements to understand the social processes of contestation over health and illness concerns.  While providing insights related to authority and expertise, health movements research tends to focus on national organizations, and has yet to consider how issues become organized at an international or global level.  In this conference paper, I seek to advance health movements research through the case of international patient safety advocacy conducted by the World Health Organizations World Alliance for Patient Safety. With the goal of promoting patient safety globally, the Alliance has set forth a variety of campaigns that ultimately seek international safety standardization in healthcare, while at the same time attempting to include the patient perspective in the development of standards.  It is through this dual process of international standardization and patient inclusion that the World Alliance makes patient safety global, and can thus be an example of a global health movement.
0	From Max Weber to Samuel Huntington, scholars have argued that religious and cultural values influence society’s institutions. One little-explored topic that has yet to be empirically tested in a quantitative study is the degree to which Islam promotes or exacerbates state institutions’ performance on gay rights. Nation-states with a higher percentage of Muslims tend to be more repressive of gay rights. Following the “literal-scripturalist” hypothesis, some argue this tendency is due to the direct influence of Islamic scriptures condemning homosexuality. Others advance the “non-essentialist” hypothesis that authoritarian political regimes and a legacy of colonialism explain why Muslim nation-states seem more oppressive of LGBT people. I test these hypotheses by conducting a cross-national statistical study of 158 countries, representing 99.4% of the world’s population, using ordered probit and negative binomial regression approaches. This analysis is complicated by endogeneity, particularly the problems of omitted variable bias and reverse causality. This is addressed by using an instrumental variable for Islam: each nation’s distance from the Ka’aba in Mecca, the locus of the founding of Islam in 632 A.D. This is the first study on Islam to use instrumental variable approaches. The study’s findings suggest that Islam does cause gay rights violations, but this causal relationship is mediated by colonialism and political regime. The policy implication is that increased democratization in the Muslim world may result in an increase in gay rights. This suggests that the Arab Spring’s movement for democracy carries the potential of increasing gay rights in the future.
1	The causal impact of higher education on earnings may be heterogeneous across different members of a population. Using a newly developed instrumental-variable method in economics, we illustrate heterogeneous treatment effects of higher education on earnings resulting from sorting mechanisms that select individuals with certain unobserved attributes into college education. The setting of our empirical work is contemporary Taiwan - a transitional economy that has recently experienced a rapid expansion in higher education. We find distinct patterns by gender, with selection bias most clearly shown among women but not among men: the college return to earnings is on average greater for women who actually attended college than women who did not attend college. 
0	Quality Matters (QM) is a program designed to offer quality assurance in online education.  If offers a set of review criteria, including a list of desired features for online course design based on research and national standards.  Many of the features stem from the researcher/teacher perspective. Using an online survey, we ask a random sample of students (N = 177) who have online course experience to rate each feature in terms of value (i.e., how much they want these features in an online course). We also examine the relationship between students who claim general satisfaction with online learning and course features. Results reveal that students do value the QM features, though not necessarily in the same ranking as QM.  Furthermore, correlations reveal that students already comfortable in online learning significantly value those features more than students with lower satisfaction in online courses in general.  A discussion surrounding whether or not the QM rubric is on target, and implication of results for QM online course design, faculty development programs, and student retention is offered.
1	Do family policies influence attitudes and behavior or are they merely reflections of preexisting attitudes? We consider the implementation of the Norwegian daddy quota, 4 weeks of parental leave reserved for the father, as a natural experiment, and examine the long-run causal effects on attitudes toward gender equality, on conflicts and sharing of household labor, and on support for public childcare. We find that respondents who had their last born child just after the reform report an 11% lower level of conflicts over household division of labor and that they are 50% more likely to equally divide the task of washing clothes than respondents who had their last child just before the reform. 
1	This research examines the influence of types of protest activities, Congressional hearings and political characteristics on environmental legislation enacted from 1961-1990. We find that rates of environmental protest rise with increases in the amount of previous institutional activities, but extra-institutional activities do not raise the overall rate of protest. Protest has no direct effect on the passage of legislation, but institutional protest activities significantly raise the rate of Congressional hearings on the environment. When comparing all environmental law's to those designated as having a major impact, we find both similarities and differences. For example, prior legislative activity decreases both rates, but increases in criteria air pollutants and partisan characteristics of Congress significantly affect only the rates of major environmental legislation.
0	Because they consciously extend a masculine presentation of self into the realm of the hypermasculine, gay leathermen are uniquely positioned to appreciate the radically constructed nature of gender.  In this research I argue that gay male leather culture in the U.S. is best seen as a collective strategy of resistance to the historically-sedimented association between homoerotic interest and effeminacy.   The leathermans hypermasculine self-presentation is here seen as both a historically-situated collective response, and as a set of practices generating an intensely erotic and intimately personal appeal.  I draw on the work of  Pierre Bourdieu (1977, 1990, 2001) and Judith Butler (1990, 1993) to analyze my ethnographic and historical data.  The research  addresses questions of gender performativity and embodiment and how these are linked with anxieties around the homosex/effeminacy link that remains a powerful narrative outside of queer cultural space.
0	Across the country, there have been several mass school shootings in recent years occurring in rural/suburban areas, the most memorable of which occurred at Columbine High School in April of 1999, resulting in 13 deaths and more than 20 wounded.  Why do some students decide to not only take a gun to school but use it, shooting and killing peers?  I propose that these students feel wronged and as a result of real and/or perceived injustices feel they must retaliate with violent action.  In this paper, I will first analyze the system that deflects attention from those students that have primarily been responsible for these rampages and how this relates to our social definitions of juvenile crime and crime in general.  Then the experiences and influences that turn average young male adults into school shooters will be explored, such as the culture of adolescence and high school, as well as violent mass media.  As a conclusion, I will investigate what can and should be done to help prevent the next school shooting, help the victims and perpetrators of these tragedies and why what society and schools are currently doing to prevent and punish may be more damaging than helpful in the long run.
1	This paper expands upon earlier research concerning methodological issues with interracial exposure and isolation (p*) indices. The earlier research, based on the fifty largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States, showed that due to skewness in the distribution of neighborhood racial compositions, these indices often overstate the degree of racial diversity in the neighborhoods of most individuals. That research showed that in the fifty largest metropolitan areas, a new measure, the median exposure or isolation index (p* -md), provided a result more representative of the situation of most individuals. This paper expands the earlier research to include all U.S. metropolitan areas. Focusing on white exposure to African Americans, it is shown that in most metropolitan areas, the majority of whites live in areas significantly whiter than indicated by the p* measure used in past studies. Moreover, the more segregated an area is, the more p* understates the degree to which African Americans are excluded from most whites' neighborhoods. Several implications of this finding for race relations are discussed. It is concluded that p*-md provides a more accurate picture than p* of the neighborhood racial composition of most white individuals. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	The substantial incorporation of people of color into government and quasi-government employment raises previously unexplored questions about the significance of race, class, and gender in street-level bureaucracies. Relying on interview data collected from black and Latino supervisors and caseworkers implementing welfare reform, I look at whether and how race and other social group memberships are deployed as tools in the delivery of casework services to black and Latino clients. Contrary to our assumptions about the level of impersonality entrenched in public bureaucracies, I find that most caseworkers and supervisors of color conceptualize and operationalize welfare reform in ways that link their goals and experiences as agency employees, members of racial communities, and implementers of social policy. They identify with the circumstances of their clients, but interpret the politics of welfare through not only racialized but also classed and gendered lenses. Consequently, they support and challenge clients of color in a variety of ways. In order to trace the origins of these strategies, I explore how the combination of institutional politics, environmental phenomenon, and black and Latino bureaucrats' personal histories contribute to their understanding of how they should do their jobs. This article suggests that not only inter-racial but also intra-racial politics inform institutional processes within street-level bureaucracies.
1	Motivated by the growing interest in and the usage of measures of material hardship, together with the lack of a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the how indicators of material hardship relate to one another, we develop and test five conceptual models of the structural coherence of material hardship. While many previous analyses have relied on a unidimensional model of hardship, we argue that this is not conceptually and empirically sufficient. Instead, we compare the standard unidimensional account of hardship to a model that contrasts hardship related to physical necessities and hardship in less critical areas, two models contrasting hardships due to short-term constraints and those with longer time horizons, and finally, a model that posits each nominal type of hardship is best represented by its own latent construct. Using nationally representative data from the 2001 and 2004 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (U. S. Census Bureau 2001, 2004), we estimate confirmatory factor analyses, which suggest that a model of hardship that separates different dimensions-health, food, bill paying, and housing hardship-fits this data better than any of the other conceptual models tested. This finding suggests strongly that the four aspects of material hardship modeled here, though obviously associated, are best understood as arising from processes and structures that are not identical. We discuss implications of our findings for both the research community and policy makers in the conclusion.
1	We propose a political reform theory, a political and historical institutionalist argument that holds that shifts in political structures, partisan regimes and policy greatly influence movements. We appraise this argument, along with resource mobilization, political opportunity and media alternatives, by analyzing 600,000 articles in the New York Times and Washington Post that mention national U.S. social movement organizations (SMOs) in the largest 34 SMO industries across the twentieth century. We provide multivariate analyses of industry-level article mentions of SMOs and detailed analyses of the historical trajectories of coverage across the century. Although we find some support for major theories of movements and media influences, the political reform theory is strongly supported and outperforms standard political opportunity models. We conclude with suggestions to synthesize theories and for research on movement and media outcomes.
0	The authors engage ecological modernization and treadmill of production theories as well as the longstanding postmaterialist values hypothesis and the objective problems subjective values hypothesis to assess the effects of national level affluence, economic growth, and environmental degradation on the likelihood of environmental concern of individuals in thirty-eight nations.   Results of multilevel logistic regression analyses indicate that a higher level of national affluence lessens the likelihood of individual level pro-environmental concern, while contrarily, economic development and growth in environmental degradation both increase the likelihood of such values.  The authors conclude by considering the theoretical implications of the findings and outlining future steps in this research agenda.
1	Whereas prior research has focused on women s access to managerial authority, an equally Important question is the effect on subordinates careers when they report to a female boss One line of thought suggests that female bosses act as change agents by fostering the careers of female subordinates whereas the cog in the machine perspective suggests that female bosses either willingly or are constrained to promote men s careers Using data from the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce analytic models of subordinates perceived job-related support from supervisors and advancement prospects were developed Results were consistent with the cog in the machine perspective in that in contrast to women men received more job-related support and were more optimistic about their careers when they reported to a female supervisor Yet given the paucity of research on this topic more research (especially longitudinal studies) is needed to fully understand how supervisors affect subordinates' careers 
1	Migrants form nonfamilial ties in urban destinations, which could compete with origin families for a share of remittances. A framework of competing commitment predicts that new relationships affect remittances depending on the extent to which they substitute for the benefits provided by origin families. Analyses of data from urban migrants in Kenya show that serious nonmarital sexual partners substitute for psychosocial support from the rural family and that material transfers migrants give to these partners significantly reduce remittances. The findings have implications for the ways scholars conceive of competition, the nature of exchange, and substitution of support across intimate relationships.
1	We examine how religious and political factors structure support for same-sex marriage in the United States over the last two decades Using data from the General Social Surveys we show that respondents who identify more strongly with the Republican Party sectarian denominations, and those who subscribe to biblical fundamentalism and political conservatism are substantially more opposed to same-sex marriage than are other Americans Heterogeneous ordinal logistic regression models show that these religious and political factors have become more important over the last two decades Cohorts born after 1945 became substantially more supportive of marriage rights between 1988 and 2008, but shifts in support for marriage rights were less sizeable for persons affiliated with sectarian denominations religious fundamentalists Republicans and political conservatives Estimates from structural equation models show that religious factors influence political conservatism and Republican identification yet both religious and political factors have significant and substantial Independent direct effects on support for same-sex marriage 
1	"Drawing on analyses of American and French news reports on ""overweight"" and ""obesity,"" this article examines how national context-including position in a global field of nation states, as well as different national politics and culture-shapes the framing of social problems. As has been shown in previous research, news reports from France-the economically dominated but culturally dominant nation of the two-discuss the United States more often than vice versa, typically in a negative way. Our contribution is to highlight the flexibility of anti-American rhetoric, which provides powerful ammunition for a variety of social problem frames. Specifically, depending on elite interests, French news reports may invoke anti-American rhetoric to reject a given phenomenon as a veritable public problem, or they may use such rhetoric to drum up concern over an issue. We further show how diverse cultural factors shape news reporting. Despite earlier work showing that a group-based discrimination frame is more common in the United States than in France, we find that the U. S. news sample is no more likely to discuss weight-based discrimination than the French news sample. We attribute this to specific barriers to this particular framing, namely the widespread view that body size is a behavior, akin to smoking, rather than an ascribed characteristic, like race. This discussion points, more generally, to some of the mechanisms limiting the diffusion of frames across social problems. Keywords: social problems, obesity, overweight, news reporting, France."
0	This paper examines the emergence and impact of peasant popular mobilization against the Mexican government's decision to build a new airport in a small village in the Mexico City metropolitan area. Using a framework that takes into account globalization and the changing character of the Mexican state, the paper show how a small indigenous movement was able to overturn a decision made in the name of national and international economic elites.
0	In this paper, I analyze Disneys Practical Magic as a form of cultural control aimed at creating work cultures that are customer-centric and nearly hegemonic.  I argue that to the extent this is achieved, it is through the use of participatory strategies and disciplinary techniques that enmeshes workers in a web of power through which organizational values, standards, and practices are legitimated and internalized.  However, looking at one companys attempt to apply a version of Practical Magic, there is evidence that engineered culture becomes embedded in the workplace through social processes as workers negotiate the day-to-day realities of their worklives.  Employees may adopt, adapt, or reject aspects of the engineered culture depending on how it intersects with other organizational constraints that shape labor processes.
0	While many congregations are moved to bring about social-political change within their communities, the segregated nature of Americas racial landscapes means that black and white congregations are active in racially exclusive communities with disparate levels of need and different concerns.  And, so the question that confronts is; Who is more active, black or white congregations in mobilizing their communities around collective concerns?  Data from the 1998 National Congregational Study suggests that while black churches tend to be located in more impoverished communities, they tend to posses fewer internal (i.e. financial resources, staff, members) and external organizational resources (i.e. collaborators, consultants) to mobilize church and community members to push for responsible public policies to address their concerns.  While these resources are important to church based political efforts, black churches were found to be more involved in voter registration efforts and as involved as white congregations in lobbying and protest activities.  Furthermore, black congregations were found to be more involved than white congregations in protest activities and marginally more likely to engage in voter registration and lobbying activities as they accrued more organizational resources.  These findings may reflect a black church culture that has historically been committed to social change.  It also may be a matter of pragmatism; black churches are one of the few civic institutions in their communities pushing for social change.  If they are not pushing for social change and social betterment in their communities, it is unlikely that anyone else will.  The implications these findings have for faith-based social welfare policy are also discussed.
0	This paper explores how diversity enters into, and depicted in, the teaching of citizenship in schools, bringing in examples from two European (England and France) and two Asian (China and Japan) countries. The empirical data come from our ongoing comparative and longitudinal research on curricula and textbooks (intended for the 12-14 age group).  We specifically focus on history and civics subjects, tracking the changes from 1945 until now.  Despite varying organization of textbook and curricula in our sample countries, we note some common trends that run across our cases.  We summarize our findings under two themes: 1) cosmopolitization of the nation and citizen; and 2 re-definition of diversity as intercultural encounters.  While the project of diversity has unmistakenly arrived in education, what is missing is its connection to the very ideals of citizenship, as originally formulated by TH Marshall.  In conclusion, we reflect on the current dilemmas that European and Asian countries are facing in addressing diversity.
1	Numerous studies have observed a positive cross-sectional relationship between the size of racial/ethnic minority groups and crime and posited that this relationship is entirely due to a causal effect of minorities on crime rates. We posit that at least some of this relationship might be due to the opposite effect: neighborhood crime increases the number of racial/ethnic minorities. This study employs a sample that allows nesting housing units within census tracts in a number of cities to test the effect of violent crime rates on residential mobility. We find that racial/ethnic transformation occurs due to two effects: first, white households are more likely to exit neighborhoods with higher rates of violent crime than are African American households. Second, whites are significantly less likely to move into a housing unit in a tract with more violent crime, particularly if this violent crime rate is increasing. On the other hand, African American and Latino households are more likely to enter neighborhoods with higher levels of violent crime. And Latinos are particularly likely to enter neighborhoods experiencing an increasing level of violent crime over the previous four years.
1	Recent researchers (Fryer Jr., R.G., Levitt, S.D., 2004. The causes and consequences of distinctly black names. Quarterly Journal of Economics 119 (3); Figlio, D.N., 2003. Names, expectations, and black children's achievement. Working Paper; Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S., 2004. Are Emily and George more employable than Lakisha and Jamal? A field experiment on labor market discrimination. American Economic Review 94 (4); Hess, G., Aura, S., 2004. What's in a name? Working Paper) have shown that people with racially identifiable names tend to have worse economic outcomes, and have tried to explain why. This paper extends this recent literature by deepening the psychological underpinnings of possible answers to this question in the context of undergraduate grades. Using a rich student-level administrative data set, I explore the effects on performance of both first and last name racial identifiability. I test for the presence of effects from either black or Asian names due to differential teacher expectations (Figlio, 2003), conventional teacher discrimination (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004), or differences in unobserved ability or racial identity that are correlated with name type and directly affect performance (Fryer and Levitt, 2004; Hess and Aura, 2004). A conceptual and empirical distinction is drawn in the paper between unobserved ability effects and racial identity effects. Name type is found to have little direct influence on performance via any channel. Mild evidence suggests that racial identity may be salient in predicting undergraduate grades. The paper contributes to the literatures in social effects, discrimination, and the burgeoning sub-field of economics and identity. 
1	Although research has documented that earnings inequality within organizations affects many dimensions of organizational outcomes, we have little knowledge about what makes some organizations more unequal than others in terms of the earnings distribution. In order to study the relationship between organizational characteristics and within-organization earnings inequality, I analyze a nationally representative sample of manufacturing establishments in the National Employer Survey (NES). The analysis focuses on how organization-level characteristics Such as workforce composition within the establishment and flexible workplace practices are associated with within-establishment earnings inequality. The results suggest that gender heterogeneity, percentage of newly hired workers within the organization, and flexible workplace practices such as job rotation and self-managed teams are significantly associated with earnings dispersion within manufacturing establishments. 
0	The dissolution of many formal barriers to gender equality and a general discourse of fairness and reciprocity suggest that todays young men and women are likely to enjoy egalitarian relationships in which they have less differentiated gender roles.  Furthermore, during young adulthood, men and women are likely to have similar economic standing, as they are in postsecondary education or are relatively new to the job market.  However, the power of cultural beliefs in maintaining existing gender arrangements, despite important institutional changes, may mean that men and women continue to act according to gendered expectations regardless of their individual intentions.  This paper attempts to untangle these conflicting possibilities by examining the distribution of power, division of labor, and sexual practices of young adults in heterosexual relationships.  Overall results suggest that there is still a great deal of gender differentiation and inequality in these relationships, and these differences appear to be consistent across racial and ethnic groups.  Additionally, individuals economic and social-psychological resources and their beliefs about gender and fairness do relatively little to explain their actual gendered behavior.  This may support the notion that cultural expectations regarding gender guide mens and womens interactions regardless of their personal beliefs or structural locations.
0	One of the key features of social movements is that they are spaces in which ordinary people claim political and social authority, or the right to make history.  Movements and activists therefore have to construct themselves as legitimate actors with political, social or cultural rights to participation.  Drawing on in-depth interviews and participant observation with teenage girl activists in five cities in the Americas, this paper explores the discursive resources that these young women call upon as they struggle to define themselves as valid and valuable contributors to social movements and social change in the context of significant exclusion and tokenization.   The central discursive threads addressed include ideas of democracy, equality, difference and generational responsibility.   Teenage girl activists, in emphasizing their roles as history-makers and agents of social change, are re-defining girlhood and youth.  Focusing on how these girls infuse their identities with political authority, this paper sheds light on a significant part of the process of collective identity formation within social movements.  It also suggests several important lessons for adult activists and the future of contemporary social movements, encouraging increased attention to the dynamics of age-based inclusion and exclusion.
1	"We investigate how 30 pediatricians and pediatric oncologists who practice and teach at elite medical centers determine whether religion and spirituality are relevant to what Andrew Abbot (1988) calls their professional ""jurisdictions."" Through in-depth interviews we focus on their everyday interactions with patients and families. We ask: (1) How do they gather information about religion and spirituality and determine when that information is relevant to their professional work? (2) Do they perceive religion and spirituality to be a barrier or a bridge to medical care as they do what Thomas Gieryn (1983) calls ""boundary work""? We find that pediatric oncologists more than pediatricians see religion and spirituality as relevant to their professional work, though still largely outside their professional jurisdiction. It is most relevant when families are making medical decisions and in end of life situations. Physicians tend to view religion and spirituality functionally, describing impermeable boundaries in medical decision making situations and more permeable boundaries at the end of life. Physicians view religion and spirituality as a barrier when it impedes medical recommendations and as a bridge when it helps families answer questions medicine inherently cannot. Such findings have implications for a wide range of professionals as they negotiate their jurisdictions, particularly around religion and spirituality, in everyday practice."
0	This study examines the emergence and persistence of self-help/mutual-aid at the end of the 20th century. Highlighting the conflicting nature of political and professional alliances and state intervention, results are consistent with recent social movement theories suggesting that institutionalizing projects depend on favorable socioeconomic, cultural and organizational conditions, such as expansion of political opportunities and legitimation. These opportunities, however, have differential effects depending on whether they occur at the field-level or as distal, environmental processes. Their effects are also conditioned by population longevity and institutional context. The analyses of population, socioeconomic and political forces shaping self-help/mutual-aid formation and persistence adds substantive complexity to our appreciation of social conditions influencing the development of social movements, and perhaps more importantly, allows us to adjudicate between the elements of organizational and socioeconomic and political models.
0	It is imminent to nature of any organizational system to recognize a critical role of the human factor.  Organizations consist of humans and therefore, we need to treat each organization as a macro human being, ascribing it human features: intelligence, emotions, discipline, consideration, ability to control itself and influence others.  Emotional intelligence (EQ) is an important concept that determines both organizational and personal success.  Recent studies have indicated a significant relationship between a degree of emotional intelligence of organizations and their level of success.  Organizational success can be referred to as a combination of profitability, reputation and the level of prestige among its stakeholders.  Emotional Intelligence at a macro-level can be defined as organizational ability to intelligently handle matters with empathy.   In order to develop an emotionally intelligent organization, various steps and techniques can be undertaken.  It is critical to match knowledge sources, techniques, and tools in order implement an EQ program effectively.  This paper analyzes, compares and contrasts existing methods and tools of organizational EQ assessment.  It presents and discusses the EQ development model designed by Antora Consulting Group - an international management consulting firm.
0	This paper examines a case in which strong relationships between individuals in a group lead paradoxically to weak group strength. Drawing from 128 interviews in rural China, I investigate the effect of Chinese ethics on microcredit efforts. Chinese ethics emphasize person-to-person (dyadic) ties rather than group membership. The villagers are studied in the context of microcredit efforts which rely upon the mutual guarantee condition: all in each village must repay their loans in order for anyone to receive subsequent loans. However, rather than monitor and pressure one another to repay to ensure ones own access to future loans, the villagers act according to an ethical framework centered on role performance within dyadic relationships. Thus, although the interpersonal relationships are extremely strong within the villages, they have difficulties cooperating as a group to repay the loans (and attain further resources). These findings contribute to the understanding of the influence of ethical perspectives on social capital and development.
0	This paper introduces shadow mobilizations as loosely configured, boundary-spanning networks that tie variously positioned environmental health professionals to contaminated communities, to environmental justice movements (EJM), to the state, and to one another. Drawing on interview and biographical data from expert activists and EJM organizers, I argue that shadow mobilizations hold significance in social movement theory as incubators of activist cultures in science, organizing and reproducing social justice-oriented expertise in at least three interrelated ways: they thicken strategic ties across expert communities; they increase the recruitment potential of experts into EJM; and they generate opportunities for institutional change in science, engineering, and public health. The potential for shadow mobilizations to spur institutional change upstream in environmental health and allied fields as well as impact struggle on the ground is conditioned by political, organizational, and temporal logics that push the networks underground and insulate vulnerable expert activists from reprisal by professional opponents and the state. Consequently, the analysis of shadow mobilizations has implications not only for social movement theory, but practical and political implications for activists and scientists as well.
1	The traditional Random Digit Dialing method (list-assisted RDD using a frame of landline phone numbers) is clearly under threat. The difficulty and costs of completing telephone surveys have increased due to rising rates of refusal and non-contact. The completeness of coverage of list-assisted ROD samples has diminished due to the proliferation of cell-phone only households. The ability of list-assisted ROD to capture young, mobile, unmarried, and minority households is thus diminishing as well. Increasingly, survey researchers have been adding a cell phone component to their sampling frames for telephone surveys, despite the increased costs and other issues associated with RDD calling of cell phones.
1	"Cross-national research finds that ""shadow education""-educational activities outside of formal schooling tends to confer advantages on already privileged students. Shadow education in the United States, such as test prep for college entrance exams, has received considerably less attention. Drawing on the National Education Longitudinal Study, we analyze the likelihood of participation in, and the implications of, SAT preparation. Social class inequalities in test preparation, particularly costly SAT courses and private tutoring, are notable and have at least moderate consequences for SAT scores and selective college enrollment. We also find racial/ethnic variations in the use of test preparation. We consider the implications of these findings for understanding shadow education, stratification and educational mobility in the United States."
1	Racial composition and unemployment have appeared as either theoretically-relevant controls or variables of substantive interest in numerous Studies of crime. While there is no clear consensus in the literature as to their statistical significance, the lack of consensus has been most apparent in panel analyses with unit fixed effects. One explanation for this is that racial composition and unemployment are fairly invariant, or slow-moving, which leads to collinearity with unit dummies. A number of pertinent studies are reviewed to illustrate how two slow-moving variables, percent black and percent unemployed, have behaved inconsistently. A fixed effects vector decomposition procedure [Plumper, V., Troeger, V. E., 2007. Efficient estimation of time-invariant and rarely changing variables in finite sample panel analyses with unit fixed effects. Political Analysis, 15, 124-139.] is used to illustrate how these variables' coefficients appear positive and significant when the slow-moving process is acounted for. 
0	In order to more closely examine the complex relationship between violent crime, residential stability, and racial/ethnic composition, we use a latent trajectory model to estimate the impact of violent crime on the rate of homeowner residential turnover while simultaneously modeling the impact of residential turnover on the trajectory of violent crime. We use a unique indicator of turnover, measured as the rate of residential home sales, since homeownership is associated with increased levels of neighborhood stability. We also take into account the racial/ethnic composition of the neighborhoods in which this stability occurs by testing whether the relationship between violent crime and residential home sales is moderated by the proportion of minority residents. Our analysis focuses on the City of Los Angeles between 1992 and 1997. Our results indicate that the effect of violent crime on residential stability is the more robust relationship. We find no support for the theoretical assertion that residential stability increases violent crime, except in neighborhoods that are highly Latino.
1	The proliferation of definitions and applications of social capital has prompted debate regarding the usefulness of the concept; there is thus an urgent need for a more rigorous usage of the term. This article proposes a distinction between three meaningful variants within the concept of social capital for the purpose of an improved dialogue and a sharpened application. The differences between these three variants-relational, collective, and generalized social capital-are first illuminated through a conceptual discussion. An empirical analysis testing the linkages between relational and collective social capital is then provided in the context of a household disaster preparedness study in Dominica. Together, analytical and empirical evidence supports the idea that social capital covers a variety of interrelated, yet distinct, social processes that operate simultaneously and may serve different purposes. On the basis of these results, this article calls for a theoretically and empirically meaningful treatment of social capital in terms of its three variants. 
0	We explore how organizations filter the effects of institutions on individual behaviors. In contrast to conceptualizations of institutions as uniformly penetrating permeable organizational boundaries, we attend to how the effects of institutions on individual behaviors can be mediated by intra-organizational social networks. In the example we find that the effects of No Child Left Behind as an institution are filtered by the pattern of close collegial ties among teachers within schools. In particular, teachers’ use of decoding was influenced by close colleagues and by members of collegial subgroups.  These social dynamics exacerbate initial differences among subgroups in instructional practices, creating challenges for organizational coordination and challenging the conceptualization of institutions as uniformly penetrating practice.
1	The study employs survey data from rural Mozambique to examine how men's labor migration affects their non-migrating wives' perceptions of HIV/AIDS risks. Using a conceptual framework centered on tradeoffs between economic security and health risks that men's migration entails for their left-behind wives, it compares women married to migrants and those married to non-migrants while also distinguishing between economically successful and unsuccessful migration. The analysis finds that the economic success of men's migration, rather than migration itself, significantly predicts women's worries about getting infected by their husbands or their own extramarital partners, and their husbands' stance on condom use. These findings are situated within a broader context of socio-economic, gender, and marital dynamics and vulnerabilities produced or amplified by male labor migration in sub-Saharan and similar developing settings.
1	Previous research argues that political brokers between rival factions play a critical role in state centralization because they help national state builders to undermine local autonomy. In contrast, this article demonstrates how coordinator elites who forge relationships within communal networks act as a counterweight to more cosmopolitan brokers, representing local interests. Evidence from new archival data on credit networks and political mobilization in Revolutionary Vermont shows that such local powerholders used their strategic position in economic networks to gain influential political offices. Moreover, coordinators strengthened local political factions that linked to national politics without eroding the interests of local communities.
1	Religion has a powerful influence on learning and development, and this provides an important cultural foundation for stratification processes. Findings from prior studies of the connection between religion and educational attainment are mixed, but most studies point to negative effects of sectarian Protestant affiliation and fundamentalist beliefs in the inerrancy of sacred texts on educational attainment, aspirations, occupational attainment, and wealth. Verbal ability provides an important potential mechanism through with conservative religion anchors stratification outcomes. I examine the impact of religious affiliation, religious participation, and beliefs in the inerrancy of the Bible on verbal ability. Using data from the 1984-2006 General Social Surveys, I find that both inerrantist beliefs and sectarian affiliations have substantial negative effects on verbal ability. Religious participation has a modest positive effect on verbal ability, but its influence is mostly confined to sectarian Protestants and biblical inerrantists. Importantly, the positive effect of age on verbal ability is substantially weaker among sectarians and biblical inerrantists, suggesting that their closed social networks hinder learning throughout the lifecourse. 
1	This paper examines the relationship between specialization and happiness in marriage in the U.S. and Japan. Our findings, based on the General Social Surveys in the U.S. and Japan, indicate both similarities and differences in the determinants of marital happiness in the two countries. In the U.S., the findings are mixed. Women's reported marital happiness in the U.S. is more likely to follow the predictions of the bargaining model where their happiness is determined by their own income. Men's marital happiness in the U.S. follows the predictions of the specialization model; they are happier if their wives are not working or, alternatively, if they are financially dependent on their wives. In Japan, we find support for the specialization model, particularly in the case of women; they are happier if they are specialized in the household and they have a higher household income. Our research highlights how marital quality is affected by the institutional context and the normative environment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	"The Marxist theory of capitalist society is based on a set of propositions concerning the wage system, which lead to predictions of a subsistence wage level, capitalist system breakdown, and socialist revolution. The failures of these Marxist predictions in all highly developed countries, and the breakdown of the socialist economies which were created in less developed countries, have almost fatally weakened Marxist economics as the basis for analysis of societies and social change. Marx's ""laws of motion"" of capitalism failed because they were based on a hidden Malthusian assumption that uncontrolled birth rates would keep wages at the ""cost of production and reproduction"" of labor power. With the creation of a global labor market with billions of subsistence farmers seeking jobs and worldwide mobility of capital, Marx's economic laws are reinstated for at least the next century. Proposed solutions for maintaining wages in the highly developed countries are examined: protectionism, human capital investment, and social ownership of capital."
0	This paper develops a notion of ontological fields by transforming Foucault's early concept of the episteme. The paper discusses the terms of this transformation and defines two fundamental aspects of this field: the texture of social relations (following Elias) and the topography of a social space (following Geertz). It concludes with a brief discussion of how to translate the concept into an empirical project.
0	Despite the rapidly growing body of research on the religious effect for volunteering in Western societies, it remains relatively unknown whether cultural capital (e.g., altruism and religious beliefs) and social capital (e.g., social networks within religious institutions) predict volunteering in the Asian context.  Using a nationally representative sample of adults in Taiwan, we test these hypotheses: (1) religious beliefs and devotional activities will be associated positively with volunteering; (2) frequency of religious attendance will be associated positively with volunteering; and (3) members of congregational religions will volunteer more than non-members.  Based on a series of logistical regression analyses, we  find: (a) religious beliefs are not associated with volunteering; (b) devotion activities are factors linked to the motivations guiding volunteering among Taiwanese; (c) affiliation with congregational groups are positively associated with volunteering; and (c) higher levels of religious attendance is related to increased volunteering.  Implications of these findings for research on volunteerism in Asians and other population groups are discussed.
0	Like the meaning of swordplay in the film Rashomon, the meaning of urban street gangs varies with the interests of the perceiver.  While a huge and growing range of quantitative data on gangs is based on positivistic assumptions that a young person either is or isnt a gang member, for young people who engage with gangs on a daily basis, the meaning of being a gang member is much more situated, contingent on who is asking about gang membership, and what might be accomplished in a given instance by claiming membership in a gang.  This paper will compare these two approaches to gangs, and highlight some of the pernicious consequences that may result when academics reify gangs to a greater extent than young people themselves.
1	This study is the first to investigate charitable giving to as many as 64 different organizations, predicting what type of charitable organization receives donations from which particular people. We test hypotheses with conditional logistic regression analysis, using the Giving in the Netherlands Panel Study (N(households) = 1246; N(organizations) = 64). We found that providing people with the opportunity to give increases donations, while which people will donate is conditional on the type of request made. Furthermore, we found some support for the argument that organizations receive more donations from people that have specific incentives (social status motives, religious and political values) to donate to these organizations. Finally, only organizations striving for difficult goals receive more donations from people with higher levels of confidence. 
1	How does collaboration between academic research and industry shape science? This article argues that companies' relative indifference to theory nudges their academic partners toward novel, theoretically unanticipated experiments. The article then evaluates this proposition using fieldwork, archival materials, and panel models of all academic research using the popular plant model Arabidopsis thaliana and the companies that support that research. Findings suggest that industry partnerships draw high-status academics away from confirming theories and toward speculation. For the network of scientific ideas surrounding Arabidopsis, industry sponsorship weaves discoveries around the periphery into looser, more expansive knowledge. Government funding plays a complementary role, sponsoring focused scientific activity in dense hubs that facilitate scientific community and understanding.
1	Focusing on micro-level processes of residential segregation, this analysis combines data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with contextual information from three censuses and several other sources to examine patterns of residential mobility between neighborhoods populated by different combinations of racial and ethnic groups. We find that despite the emergence of multiethnic neighborhoods, stratified mobility dynamics continue to dominate, with relatively few black or white households moving into neighborhoods that could be considered multiethnic. However, we also find that the tendency for white and black households to move between neighborhoods dominated by their own group varies significantly across metropolitan areas. Black and white households' mobility into more integrated neighborhoods is shaped substantially by demographic, economic, political, and spatial features of the broader metropolitan area. Metropolitan-area racial composition, the stock of new housing, residential separation of black and white households, poverty rates, and functional specialization emerge as particularly important predictors. These macro-level effects reflect opportunities for intergroup residential contact as well as structural forces that maintain residential segregation.
0	Using qualitative data collected from interviews with participants in a marriage initiative, we extend beyond prior studies on the barriers to marriage by including topics that are not a common part of the dialogue about marriage.  Our findings show that the social context for marriage shapes views and decisions about marriage, cohabitation and divorce.  Specifically, the presence or lack of relationship role models in the community, family, and religion determines in part attitudes toward relationships.
0	The path along which the Qing Empire transformed into the Peoples Republic of China as a modern nation-state is perhaps the most peculiar in the world history of nation formation. While most other multinational world-empires disintegrated into multiple culturally homogenous nation-states in their transition to modernity, China managed to transform nearly all of its imperial territory into a singular nation-state. But this process is far from complete and uncontested. In the last half century, Communist China kept redefining its conception of nationhood in response to shifting internal socio-political alignment, changing structure of world order, and above all, challenges from the recalcitrant or not-yet-incorporated peripheral regions such as Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong. This paper examines the interplay between Beijings changing conceptions of nationhood and different socio-political forces in Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong since 1949. This study shows that pre-modern conception of nationhood is as important as modern conceptions of nationhood originating in Europe in modern Chinas self-definition. It also illustrates that any conceptions of nationhood are never fixated ideologies predesigned by nation-builders. Instead, they were malleable discourses successively modified or even transformed in response to complicated socio-political struggles as well as emergent counter-nation-building projects in the nation's periphery. The paper concludes that nationalism should not be studied as an ahistorical artifact, but should be studied as a contextualized historical process constantly in the making.
1	"Military expenditures have escalated over the last three decades in both developed and less developed countries, without a corresponding expansion of military personnel. Spending has instead been directed towards hi-tech weaponry, what we refer to as the ""new"" military. We hypothesize that this new, increasingly capital-intensive military is no longer a pathway of upward mobility or employer of last resort for many uneducated, unskilled, or unemployed people, with significant consequences for those individuals and society as a whole. One such consequence, we argue, is an increase in income inequality. We test this hypothesis with cross-national panel models, estimated for 82 developed and less developed countries from 1970 to 2000. Findings indicate that military capital-intensiveness, as measured by military expenditures per soldier, exacerbates income inequality net of control variables. Neither total military expenditures/GDP nor military participation has a significant effect. It appears from these findings that today's ""new"" military establishment is abrogating its historical role as an equalizing force in society, with important policy implications. "
1	Recent inequality scholarship fixates on trends in the amount of inequality and largely ignores trends in the form of inequality. The authors describe three ideal-typical inequality regimes (big-class, microclass, and gradational) and identify the mechanisms driving a shift toward or away from each of them. Using GSS and CPS data on 39 measures of life chances, attitudes, and behaviors, the authors find that big-class inequality is in decline whereas microclass inequality has remained stable. Moreover, big classes are simplifying into largely economic aggregates, whereas microclasses remain more complicated moral configurations that cannot be understood in terms of economic standing.
0	This paper examines the system of social provision for servicemen who returned from World War I psychologically disabled.  Drawing from government documents and veterans medical files from St. Elizabeths hospital, I demonstrate that psychologically disabled soldiers represented a form of abject masculinity for the doctors, social workers, and policy administrators who were entrusted with their care and compensation. As a result, the programmatic characteristics of disability compensation for veterans in St. Elizabeths included constant regulation and surveillance and rendered these men permanent wards of the state.  Through this grounded, policy-in-action approach, the gendered dimensions of military welfareand specifically the construction of masculinitiesappear more complex and diverse than previously theorized.  I conclude the article by noting the implications for understandings of gender, the military, and the U.S. welfare state and the significance of this study for the current political context.
1	"This study examines the role of ""ecological threat"" in shaping the U.S. environmental movement. Statistical analysis combines founding data on 772 national environmental movement organizations with ecological data on air pollution levels and amphibian and bird populations. We examine these data longitudinally, from 1962 through 1998. Net of other social, economic, and political factors suggested by social movement theory, we find evidence of segmented effects in the expected directions: Declines in wildlife populations are associated with the foundings of wildlife and wilderness protection organizations while increases in air pollution are associated with the foundings of organizations focused on ecosystem well-being and public health. These findings help refine long-held assumptions about the relationship between ecological degradation and environmental activism, and demonstrate the broader utility of the threat concept for strengthening theories of social movement mobilization."
1	"The self-reported health question summarizes information about health status across several domains of health and is widely used to measure health because it predicts mortality well. We examine whether interactional behaviors produced by respondents and interviewers during the self-reported health question-answer sequence reflect complexities in the respondent's health history. We observed more problematic interactional behaviors during question-answer sequences in which respondents reported worse health. Furthermore, these behaviors were more likely to occur when there were inconsistencies in the respondent's health history, even after controlling for the respondent's answer to the self-reported health question, cognitive ability, and sociodemographic characteristics. We also found that among respondents who reported ""excellent"" health, and to a lesser extent among those who reported their health was ""very good,"" problematic interactional behaviors were associated with health inconsistencies. Overall, we find evidence that the interactional behaviors exhibited during the question-answer sequence are associated with the respondent's health status. "
0	An increase in the population of biracial individuals in the U.S. has caused the proliferation of theories of biracial identity development and maintenance.  Presently theories on biracial identity development do not fully capture the complexity of biracial identity formation for the black/white biracial population in the twenty-first century.  In my work I conceptualize identity categories for biracial individuals that reflect this complexity.  I present a model of biracial identity development that reevaluates the weight given to specific influences on identity, and explores the complexity of various influences on racial identity.  In this model I identify previous models of racial identity formation for biracial individuals and expand these models to include dynamics of this process that are neglected.  This new model will elaborate on existing models of racial identity development, and will stress the two factors I believe influence the racial identity formation process most: an individuals appearance and the neighborhoods tolerance of a biracial identity.  The model suggests that these two factors, along with other factors, contribute to biracial individuals choosing a black, white, or biracial identity, developing a marginal identity, fluctuating between a singular or biracial identity circumstantially, or an individual choosing not to adopt a racial identity at all.  This work also attempts to add to the body of literature on biracial identity by explicitly identifying the ways in which culture and racial identity diverge in the black/white racial population.
1	Despite high rates of nonmarital childbearing in the United States, little is known about the health of women who have nonmarital births. We use data from the NLSY79 to examine differences in age 40 self-assessed health between women who had a premarital birth and those whose first birth occurred within marriage. We then differentiate women with a premarital first birth according to their subsequent union histories and estimate the effect of marrying or cohabiting versus remaining never-married on midlife self-assessed health. We pay particular attention to the paternity status of a mother's partner and the stability of marital unions. To partially address selection bias, we employ multivariate propensity score techniques. Results suggest that premarital childbearing is negatively associated with midlife health for white and black women, but not for Hispanic women. We find no evidence that the negative health consequences of nonmarital childbearing are mitigated by either marriage or cohabitation for black women. For other women, only enduring marriage to the child's biological father is associated with better health than remaining unpartnered.
1	Why do states lose the capacity to finance the expansionist military policies, economic development strategies, or domestic spending initiatives they once supported? The path-dependent models offered by fiscal-military, rational choice, and geopolitical theorists are evaluated in comparison with an elite conflict model of contingent historical change. The latter model is found to be better able to explain territorial and fiscal stagnation and decline as well as imperial expansion in the cases of early modern Spain, France, the Netherlands, and Britain.
0	The U.S. cultural discourse in regard to race is strikingly different now, in the early years of the 21st century, than it was in the 20th century, and many organizations and institutions are seeking to change with the times and incorporate elements of the new racial discourse rather than the old racial discourse of discrimination.  The contemporary “color-blind” ideology puts forward the notion of a “multicultural” society.  Instead of two racial groups, the multicultural discourse recognizes an infinite number, and individuals can identify with any number of racial or ethnic categories.  On-campus organizations such as Greek Letter Organizations (GLOs) are following this trend.  Historically, GLOs have traditionally been divided along a racial binary, but in recent years an explosion of multicultural GLOs (MGLOs) has been apparent on college campuses.  Also important is the rise in popularity of Hispanic GLOs.  Multicultural and Hispanic GLOs are sometimes forced into mixed Greek Councils of large universities with diverse student populations.  How do members of MGLOs and HGLOs conceive of multiculturalism?  Why do they choose to join an organization with overt multicultural principles when there are more traditional choices available?  What dilemmas do MGLOs and HGLOs face in their Greek Council?  What does it mean for different models of race to have such an organization on campus?  This paper explores these questions by presenting findings from interviews with GLO members and observational data gained from observing the Multicultural Greek Council at a large university in the American South.
0	The literature on sociology of education has frequently focused on the importance of parent involvement in education. Overwhelmingly, however, researchers have portrayed parent involvement as a fundamentally cooperative venture. In this paper, we draw on ethnographic data from a public elementary school in a suburban upper-middle-class community to examine collective forms of parent involvement in the parent-teacher organization. We find conflicts between parents and educators to be common. We suggest that the sources of conflicts are rooted in the different structural locations of educators and parents. Educators draw on their professional authority as they seek to prevent parents from encroaching on their decisions. We suggest that our current models in sociology of education on parent involvement are incomplete. At a conceptual and policy level, we need to focus more on the nature of conflict in parent involvement in schooling.
1	Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, discrimination in employment on the basis of color is prohibited, and color is a protected basis independent from race. Using data from the spouses of the main respondents to the New Immigrant Survey 2003, this paper shows that immigrants with the lightest skin color earn on average 16-23% more than comparable immigrants with the darkest skin color. These estimates control for years of legal permanent residence in the US, education, English language proficiency, occupation in source country, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, race, country of birth, as well as for extensive current labor market characteristics that may be themselves influenced by discrimination. Furthermore, the skin color penalty does not diminish over time. These results are consistent with persistent skin color discrimination affecting legal immigrants to the United States. 
1	Increases in the association between spouses' earnings have the potential to increase inequality as marriages increasingly consist of two high-earning or two low-earning partners. This article uses log-linear models and data from the March Current Population Survey to describe trends in the association between spouses' earnings and estimate their contribution to growing earnings inequality among married couples from 1967 to 2005. The results indicate that increases in earnings inequality would have been about 25%-30% lower than observed in the absence of changes in the association, depending on the inequality measure used. Three components of these changes and how they vary across the earnings distribution are explored.
0	This study looks at the effect of prenatal natural disaster exposure on birth outcomes for twenty cohorts of children born in the state of North Carolina.  Combining North Carolina administrative data on births with disaster declarations from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) allows identification of children who were exposed to disasters in each trimester of prenatal development.  Using a fixed effect strategy, these children are compared to other children born in the same county who were not exposed to disasters while in utero.  Additionally, this study looks at maternal health behaviors, including prenatal care and tobacco usage, as potential mechanisms through which natural disasters may influence birth outcomes.  Results suggest that prenatal natural disaster exposure, especially exposure to hurricanes, has a significant effect on some maternal health behaviors, notably prenatal care usage and cigarette smoking.  Additionally, results suggest that these effects are more concentrated among children in disadvantaged subgroups.  However, this study does not provide support for the theory that natural disaster exposure negatively affects birth outcomes, at least as measured by birth weight and gestational age.
0	During the last two decades the intensified and multilayered neo-liberal transformations in Turkey have introduced historical shifts in the ways in which personal and collective identities are defined, allowing for the production of new selves. This paper identifies the site of romance as foundational to the attainment, and performance of the new middle-class masculinity and neo-liberal subjectivity. Theoretically, this paper brings into sharp focus the limitations of perspectives that identify the realm of sex with masculinity and the realm of romance with femininity.
0	This paper focuses on the work experiences of the children of immigrants from Mexico and Central America, ages 10-21, who work with their parents in the informal sector of the economy as street vendors in the Los Angeles area.  In this paper I demonstrates how adolescent street vendors contribute to household decisions.  Drawing on participant observations and 20 in-depth interviews, this paper extends the scholarly literature on household dynamics, most of which has been devoted to understanding family-work balance and spousal relations. Based on several principal findings, I argue that children in street vending families exercise power in the household because of their: 1) “American cultural resources ” such as English language skills, citizenship, and technology and culture knowledge, all valued by their parents and useful for the family street vending business; 2) contributions to their family’s income; and 3) involvement in business negotiations and decision-making processes.  These findings advance our understanding of street vendors and household dynamics through a much-needed focus on second generation children who work with their parents.
0	Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging, this study examined the relationship between social support and mortality among older people with diabetes. Results of survival analyses showed that social support was strongly associated with mortality. With all things being equal, compared to people with a low level of social support, the risk of death is 41 percent lower among people with medium levels of support and 55 percent lower among those with highest levels of support (p<0.05). We also found that the effect of social support on mortality is mediated by both physical and mental health status. Based on findings from this study, social support should be considered an important target for intervention to reduce mortality risk among older adults with diabetes
1	This paper reports results from a unique experiment conducted in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to gauge the effect of question format on men's reports of contraceptive use at last sexual intercourse. Respondents received separate questions about their own and their partners' contraceptive use or one combined question about either partner's contraceptive use. We examine whether receiving separate questions, as opposed to one combined question, is related to higher reports of using any contraceptive method, specific methods, female methods in addition to male methods, and the number of methods reported. We find that reports of any contraceptive use at last sex and use of the most common methods, condoms and the pill, were stable across question formats. However, we find significantly higher reports of withdrawal, combining male and female methods, and multiple method use among men who received the separate-question format. We also find that characteristics of the sexual experience in question condition the effect of question format on men's reports. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	Alliance building across social movement groups is an important aspect of social movement dynamics, contributing to their viability and capacity to promote social change. Yet, with few exceptions, cross-movement coalitions have received little sustained theoretical or empirical attention. This article contributes to an understanding of cross-movement coalition building through the examination of a successful case of alliance: a coalition of environmental justice and peace and anti-weapons proliferation groups to stop a federally funded U. S. biodefense laboratory from being built and operated in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Cross-movement collaboration was challenged by tensions arising from differences in positionality. Positional differences reflect status distinctions such as race, class, gender, and place and the differential experiences and expectations that result. Nonetheless, this coalition was able to resolve positional tensions and, as a result, remained a viable protest vehicle. We found this was accomplished through a cross-movement bridging process that involved (1) cause affirmation, (2) strategic deployment, (3) exclusion, and (4) co-development of cross-movement commitments. We extend existent accounts of cross-movement coalition by providing both a culturally founded and fine-grained account of coalition work in the maintenance of alliance relations. The article and its conclusions also address the broader implications of understanding successful trans-positional cross-movement alliances.
1	"This paper extends work on corporate philanthropy by arguing that we need to look not only at legal and institutional factors that shape corporate philanthropic activity but also at the ecology of the ""consuming"" organizations toward which philanthropic activity is directed. We examine the forces that shape the philanthropic practices of corporations, focusing our analysis on corporate giving to local schools. The analysis draws upon a survey of the philanthropic practices of a representative sample of 2776 corporations in the United States in 2002. Two significant findings emerge: first, higher levels of state corporate taxation are associated with greater levels of giving to local schools. This finding fits well with established arguments about the relationship between tax write-offs and charitable giving-higher taxes provide greater incentives for increasing philanthropic activity. Second the proportion of private schools in a given state is inversely related to philanthropic giving to local schools. We argue that the ecology of the receiving organizations in this area shape the perceptions of need among corporate givers. Corporations that are in states that have more competition between schools and a healthier ""market"" for education demonstrate less commitment supporting the provision of social services in this area.

1	The sociological literature on social movement organizations (SMOs) has come to recognize that under neoliberal globalization many SMOs have moved from an emphasis on the state as the locus of change toward a focus on corporations as targets. This shift has led some SMOs to turn to forms of market-based private regulatory action. The use of one such tactic-voluntary, third-party product certification-has grown substantially, as SMOs seek ways to hold stateless firms accountable. This article explores the case of the international fair trade movement, which aims to change the inequitable terms of global trade in commodities for small farmers, artisans, and waged laborers. Drawing from interviews with a range of fair trade participants, document analysis, and media coverage, the article describes fair trade's growing relationship with multinational coffee firms, particularly Starbucks and Nestle. It explores intra-movement conflicts over the terms for and the effects of corporate participation in fair trade, and illuminates tensions between conceptualizations of fair trade as movement, market, and system: The article makes two arguments. First, while fair trade has succeeded partially in reembedding market exchange within systems of social and moral relations, it has also proved susceptible to the power of corporate actors to disembed the alternative through a process of movement co-optation. Second, it argues that co-optation takes a unique form in the context of social movements whose principal tools to achieve social change are certification and labeling: it occurs primarily on the terrain of standards, in the form of weakening or dilution.
1	Does a racial earnings gap exist among individuals who come from similar childhood socioeconomic backgrounds? Is the racial earnings gap larger or smaller for those from higher or lower socioeconomic origins? This research addresses these questions by taking a counterfactual approach to estimating the residual racial pay gap between non-Hispanic black and white men from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth The findings indicate that the racial earnings gap is larger among those from lower-middle class and working class childhood backgrounds than among those from upper-middle class backgrounds for whom the racial pay gap is indistinguishable from zero Compared to their more advantaged counterparts black men from lower-middle and working class backgrounds have more difficulty rising above their socioeconomic origins relative to white men from similar social class backgrounds Racial earnings equality among those from upper-middle class backgrounds suggests that the high levels of racial inequality often observed among those with college and professional degrees may in fact reflect heterogeneous childhood socioeconomic backgrounds among the college educated backgrounds that continue to have an effect on earnings despite individual academic achievements 
0	A number of studies have found that teenagers who are more religious are significantly less likely to be sexually active, but the mechanisms by which this occurs have not been adequately explored. Sociology has long emphasized the importance of morality, and recent work has more carefully conceptualized the necessity of moral frameworks to human agency and the general importance of moral authority to understanding behavior. A growing strand of research in philosophy and sociology has highlighted rising individualism and elevated importance of the autonomous self in modern culture. Using survey data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, I examine the relationship between religion and source of moral authority predicting the likelihood of teens having had sexual intercourse. Logistic regression results show that teens citing an individualistic source of moral authority are much more likely to have had sex than teens citing an external source of moral authority. The statistical relationship partially mediates the relationship between religion and sex, but is stronger than only mediating. The 2nd wave of NSYR data will be finalized spring 2006, and will allow me to parse out the causal-direction issue between stated source of moral authority and sexual activity, prior to the 2006 ASA meetings.
1	Researchers hypothesize that social capital in the United States is not just declining, but that it is declining across generations or birth cohorts. Testing this proposition, we examine changes in social capital using age-period-cohort intrinsic estimator models. Results from analyses of 1972-2010 General Social Survey data show (1. that informal association with neighbors declined across periods while informal association with friends outside of the neighborhood increased across birth cohorts; (2. that formal association was comparatively stable with the exception of relatively high levels of formal association among the early 1920s and early 1930s birth cohorts; and (3. that trust declined considerably across both periods and cohorts, though the oldest cohorts are less trusting than those born in the 1920s through the 1940s. While the results suggest that changes in social capital are more complex than the simple decline depicted by many researchers, the aspects of social capital that have declined may be essential for promoting social and political participation.
1	"Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this paper explores the extent to which residing in ""non-traditional"" sibling compositions (i.e., living with step- and/or half-siblings) explains the relationship between academic disadvantage and stepfamily living. Net of demographic and family background characteristics, ""non-traditional"" sibling compositions are associated with lower grades and higher levels of school-related behavior problems. The disadvantage associated with ""non-traditional"" siblings accumulates or remains constant over time as family members live together. Controlling for sibling composition mediates the lowered outcomes of youth in married stepfamilies and explains a portion of the disadvantage experienced by those in cohabiting stepfamilies. Thus, part of what makes stepfamily life detrimental to the academic outcomes of youth appears to be the complexity, ambiguity and stress that comes with having ""non-traditional"" siblings living within the same home. These results confirm the importance of considering the composition of a young person's entire residential family unit, rather than focusing exclusively on the structure of parent-child relations, when studying adolescent academic outcomes.

1	Although there is considerable evidence linking success-including wealth, marriage, and friendships-to happiness, this relationship might not reflect, as is often assumed, the effects of the proximate environment on well-being. Such an interpretation is contravened by evidence that both happiness and the environment are influenced by genetic factors and family upbringing. Using the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, which includes a sub-sample of twins, this study evaluates the relationship between happiness and various features of success before and after eliminating the influence of endowments. The results suggest that many putative indicators of the environment are highly heritable and, indeed, that the same genes that affect the environment may affect happiness as well. Yet the results also suggest that the role of genetic endowments varies considerably across different features of success, suggesting complex patterns of selection, reinforcement, and causation among genes and the environment.
1	The rise in subprime lending and the ensuing wave of foreclosures was partly a result of market forces that have been well-identified in the literature, but it was also a highly racialized process. We argue that residential segregation created a unique niche of minority clients who were differentially marketed risky subprime loans that were in great demand for use in mortgage-backed securities that could be sold on secondary markets. We test this argument by regressing foreclosure actions in the top 100 U.S. metropolitan areas on measures of black, Hispanic, and Asian segregation while controlling for a variety of housing market conditions, including average creditworthiness, the extent of coverage under the Community Reinvestment Act, the degree of zoning regulation, and the overall rate of subprime lending. We find that black residential dissimilarity and spatial isolation are powerful predictors of foreclosures across U.S. metropolitan areas. To isolate subprime lending as the causal mechanism through which segregation influences foreclosures, we estimate a two-stage least squares model that confirms the causal effect of black segregation on the number and rate of foreclosures across metropolitan areas. We thus conclude that segregation was an important contributing cause of the foreclosure crisis, along with overbuilding, risky lending practices, lax regulation, and the bursting of the housing price bubble.
1	"Despite decades of research on the benefits of educational expectations, researchers have failed to show that unrealized plans are consequential for mental health, as self-discrepancy and other social psychological theories would predict. This article uses two national longitudinal studies of youth to test whether unrealized educational expectations are associated with depression in adulthood. Negative binomial regression analyses show that unmet expectations are associated with a greater risk of depression among young adults who share similar educational expectations. The apparent consequences of aiming high and falling short result, however, from lower attainment, not the gap between plans and attainment. Results indicate almost no long-term emotional costs of ""shooting for the stars'' rather than planning for the probable, once educational attainment is taken into account. This lack of association also holds after accounting for early mental health, the magnitude of the shortfall, the stability of expectations, and college-related resources, and it is robust across two distinct cohorts of high school students. We develop a theory of ""adaptive resilience'' to account for these findings and, because aiming high and failing are not consequential for mental health, conclude that society should not dissuade unpromising students from dreams of college."
0	Together, with our students at two State Universities, we  have tried to expand learning and communication between the university and the community with the use of visual and performance art to illustrate issues of criminal justice and social justice. The lessons of the newest of our fields, visual sociology, visual anthropology or communication and media, is that talking about ideas, substantive ideas such as fairness, exploitation, governance, sensitivity to the Other, etc. by using visual stimuli or aural stimuli to accompany those ideas teaches them more appropriately and with easier access than traditional learning. One of Bruners contributions to learning theory was the visualization of abstract concepts and how such visualization made it possible for children to learn critical and abstract thought faster than maturity alone permitted.  What visual sociology does is to focus on teaching communities of people (mostly students because of the strange orientation of our educational system that those are the only ones to be educated) use photography, video, etc. in what we call  participatory and interactive.  What we do is add to the visual approach with a two-day exhibit at the university at which the public and our students are invited to exhibit and share with us their analysis of the meaning of the visual work they have produced. The purpose of this poster presentation to is to share with others a part of our visual and performance exhibition.
0	Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was a top-secret city of the Manhattan Project created for the sole purpose of producing an atomic bomb. Perhaps surprisingly, there are two interlocking tropes that are primarily used to describe the town’s early construction and design: the frontier and utopia. In Oak Ridge, the frontier and utopian imaginations do not compete so much as nestle alongside and within each other. Of course the frontier and utopian imaginations are not unique to the former secret atomic city of Oak Ridge, but characteristic of other regional and national myths as well. What is unique is how these common tropes are used to tell the story of a particular town at the emergence of atomic modernity.  This paper focuses on the utopian design of the town, the social segregation that emerged, and the nostalgic longings that many residents feel for the early atomic landscape of Oak Ridge.
1	Domestic violence continues to be a serious problem for women in the United States. As a result, the battered women's movement has been Tireless in campaigning for greater awareness of the issue, tougher penalties against offenders, and public vigilance against potential batterers, including fathers from dissolving families. In reaction to this stance, a small but vocal countermovement composed of activists in the fathers' rights movement has argued that the BWM is guilty of what I term enemy boundary creep, a perception whereby these men maintain that they have been inappropriately targeted. Using 40 in-depth interviews with fathers' rights activists located across the country, this article details the narrative that these men have composed as to why the BWM is expanding the scope of its enemies, the tactics that the BWM is using in this campaign, and the insidious effects that these efforts are having on fathers across the Country. This narrative formulates a boundary-push back response. This analysis thus articulates how an Unlikely countermovement can use the accusation of enemy boundary creep by its social movement opponents in an effort to shift the political discourse on a significant public problem.
0	This paper analyzes the factors associated with socioeconomic outcomes among low income single mothers in rural Northern New England.  In particular, we focus on work and dependence on public assistance as alternative strategies for coping with single parenthood and low income.  We draw on previous literature on single mothers as well as research on the role of social capital in affecting the life chances of poor women and families. Based on a probability sample of 509 single mothers age 18-39 living in rural Northern New England, we find that dependence on TANF and other public services is related to low education, younger age, more frequent interactions with friends, but less perceived social support from friends.  Work strategies are more likely among older women with higher levels of education, among those with greater organizational ties, a longer length of time in their community, and greater social support from family.  The findings are evidence of the importance of social networks and social support in how rural single mothers cope with their situations.
0	This paper draws on qualitative data gathered in a longitudinal, two-country study to explore the survival strategies of poor Honduran transnational families, and to identify the structures that hinder their reunification. I argue that poor transnational families, defined as those divided between two nation-states, depend on alternative family structures and ideologies for their maintenance.  Specifically, kin-networks provide the financial and caretaking support that enable families to utilize transnational strategies for survival and/or economic mobility, and to sustain themselves, often for many years, in a transnational space. Transnationalizing the family has emotional and economic repercussions for those involved.  While economic remittances support the material well-being of families in the host country, transmigrants in the US suffer from low-wages, poor working conditions, and the loneliness of being away from loved ones. A challenge to assimilation theories of migration, this paper brings the literatures on transnationalism and the family into dialogue, exposing the transnational family as an inevitable expression of global Capitalism, and encouraging social scientists to rethink their basic notions of transnationalism and family.
0	Research on gender roles and the household division of labor provides us with an understanding of how men and women divide household labor. A key factor in determining household labor is marital status. The roles of husbands and wives can be especially powerful for women. In fact, women often face additional expectations when they become wives. Often women need to negotiate with ideas about what it means to be a mother and caretaker. Women and men often display their proper gender roles through the household division of labor. There is a large literature on how families and individuals negotiate the household division of labor, but much of this work fails to examine how gender and race influence the household division of labor. In this paper, I examine whether there are gender and racial differences associated with the household division of labor. I focus specifically on whether marital status, a strong indicator of household labor, has similar effects on the division of labor for minority and White families. I use the National Survey of Families and Households and use regression analysis to analyze how gender and race are associated with the household division of labor while controlling for socioeconomic characteristics for three large racial and ethnic groups: Latinos, African Americans, and Whites. My analysis shows that the household division of labor is unequal between men and women and minority groups. In addition, it supports previous findings that show that being married increases housework, especially for women.
1	The Protestant Reformation swept across Central Europe in the early-sixteenth century, leaving cities divided into Evangelical and Catholic camps as some instituted reforms and others remained loyal to the Roman Church. In offering a new explanation of the Reformation, we develop a theory that identifies ideologically mobilized students as bridge actors-that is, agents of religious contention who helped concatenate incidents of local insurgency into a loosely organized Evangelical movement by bridging structural holes. Building on existing literature, we offer a novel way to measure the influence of contending religious movements through university enrollments; we propose that the institution of reform can be partially explained by the varying degree of exposure that cities had to Evangelical activist and Catholic loyalist university students. Based on statistical analysis of a novel dataset comprising cities in the Holy Roman Empire with a population of 2,000 or more from 1523 to 1545, we find support for the role of university students as bridge actors linking critical communities at universities to arenas of urban contention. The greater a city's exposure to heterodox ideology through city-to-university ties, the greater its odds of instituting the Reformation.
0	Some theories of political participation in the United States argue that the introduction of the internet or predominance of advocacy organizations have changed how citizens participate in politics.  One line of reasoning claims that there is an overall decline participation, and others add that the pattern of participation itself has changed as more people donate money than attend rallies or volunteer time.  Distinguishing these patterns is complicated as the frequency of participation is not a clear signal of this change.  A general decline in participation could affect rates of activities differently while leaving the general structure of participation unchanged.  I argue that, should there be any change in the patterns in which citizens participate, it would be evident in the relationship between donating money and other participation activities.  Further, frequencies and correlation-based regression analysis miss this relationship structure.  Using methods from social network analysis, I show that the relationships between individual campaign donations and other forms of participation are unchanging over the last 50 years.  Even dividing samples by ideology (liberal, moderate, conservative, and other) shows that these subgroups, with the exception of the last category, also participate in politics in the same patterns.
0	This study investigates how ritual practices are disrupted in disasters and the ways people deal with those disruptions. Deritualization refers to the breakdown or loss of ritualized activities that occur in daily life. The thesis of this research paper is that ritual practices are disrupted in a disaster leading to the breakdown of action and meaning. Data were collected from 19 seminal sociological studies from the National Academy of Sciences published first under the name of the Committee on Disaster Studies (1951-1957) and then under the rubric of the Disaster Research Group (1957-1962).  A content analysis of these studies revealed many instances of deritualization. Deritualization is manifested or most evident through its effects on action and meaning in rituals. Examples were categorized according to the loss of action, meaning or a combination of both. Given the emphasis of past disaster studies on social structure, this study makes an important contribution by calling attention to social psychological dynamics. Specifically, it highlights the importance of rituals in both routine and non-routine settings.
1	Desistance from criminal offending has become the source of a considerable amount of research attention. Much of this literature has examined how environmental factors, such as marriage, employment, and delinquent peers contribute to the desistance process. A relatively unexplored possibility, however, is that desistance from criminal behavior is partially due to genetic factors. To test this possibility, data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) were used to examine the effects that five different genetic polymorphisms (DAT1, DRD2, DRD4, 5HTT, and MAOA) have on desistance from delinquent involvement. Three broad findings emerged. First, marriage significantly increased desistance. Second, some of the genetic polymorphisms had significant independent effects on desistance. Third, for males, the genetic polymorphisms interacted with marital status to predict variation in desistance. The findings underscore the importance of using a biosocial perspective to examine factors related to criminal desistance. 
1	This study examines the effects of welfare, Food Stamp, and Individual Development Account rules on low-education families' asset holding, using family-level data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation covering 1991-2003 and state-level data from various sources. Fixed-effect regression models estimate the relationship between state program rules and liquid assets, vehicle assets, and net worth. The results suggest that more lenient asset limits in means-tested programs and more generous IDA rules may have positive effects on asset holdings among low-education families. 
0	Persistent inequalities in the well-being of youth are widely recognized, yet too rarely does strategic action narrow the gap between this reality and the promise of equal opportunity for all. In political discourse conservatives and liberals have historically sparred over whether inequalities stem from individual or social failures, but both tend to view the patterns as chronic, inadvertently feeding the quiescent acceptance of inequality rather than a forceful policy and community response (Edelman 1977). Our search for remedies for the Sacramento Capital Region led us into conversations with representatives of the institutions that serve youth in the region. We wanted to understand three types of cultural frames used by these individuals: diagnostic (what is the problem?), prognostic (what should be done?), and motivational (what is most likely to motivate action?). Geographic inequity is a widely shared presumption of our respondents, but the solutions they imagine rarely emphasize action at the regional scale.  As might be expected, prognostic and motivational frames tend to be focused on the issues of most direct concern to the work that respondents do directly, reinforcing their own roles and emphasizing the issues facing particular subpopulations of youth.  While there are opportunities to the frame youth issues at the regional scale, there is considerable work to be done to encourage the perception that ‘regions matter’.
0	Data from 19 Western countries participating in the International Crime Victimization Survey were analyzed to better understand public attitudes towards criminal punishment, especially punitiveness.  An analysis relying on logistic regression modeling and hierarchical linear models revealed that: (1) public punitiveness varies substantially across Western countries, with the U.S. leading all countries in punitiveness; (2) the same predictors influence punitiveness in a similar way across Western countries; and (3) there is strong evidence that a utilitarian rationale underlies punitiveness at both the individual and country level.  More specifically, those who think the police are doing an inadequate job, who employ crime-prevention measures such as having a burglar alarm or gun, and who perceive their risk of break-in to be high are the most punitive, and those who live in countries with high violent crime rates and high incarceration rates are also more punitive.  Fully 40 percent of variation in punitiveness among countries is due to their incarceration and violent crime rates alone (i.e., net of individual-level influences on punitiveness).  These findings suggest that citizens of liberal Western democracies are reacting to what they perceive to be the tangible threat of criminal victimization, a reaction that has been fueled by national political campaigns in many of those countries.
1	This article argues that unemployment benefits are providing a crucial but often overlooked function by reducing the insecurity associated with modern labor markets. Because job insecurity is associated with concerns about future financial security, economic support during unemployment may lessen the negative effects of job insecurity on employed individuals' well-being. Using data from the European Social Survey, this article shows that the generosity of unemployment benefits makes a difference to the subjective well-being of employed individuals, especially those with limited economic resources and an insecure position in the labor market. These results indicate that unemployment benefits may be viewed as a collective resource with important external benefits, i.e., benefits to society over and above those to the unemployed who directly utilize such benefits.
1	This study develops a comprehensive theoretical framework regarding the evolution of the class divide in postsecondary education. I conceptualize three prototypes of class inequality-effectively maintained, declining, and expanding-and associate their emergence with the level of competition in college admissions. I also unearth the twin mechanisms, exclusion and adaptation, that link class hierarchy to a highly stratified postsecondary system in an allegedly meritocratic environment. Intra- and inter-cohort comparisons reveal that while the class divide regarding enrollment and access to selective postsecondary schooling is ubiquitous, it declines when competition for slots in higher education is low and expands during periods of high competition. In such a regime of effectively expanding inequality (EEI), a greater emphasis on a certain selection criterion (like test scores) in admission decisions-required to sort the influx of applicants-is bolstered by class-based polarization vis-a-vis this particular criterion. This vicious cycle of exclusion and adaptation intensifies and expedites the escalation of class inequality. The results show that adaptation is more effective than exclusion in expanding class inequality in US. higher education.
0	This study analyses the issue of comparative corruption in the national higher education sectors in the United States and the Russian Federation. In both nations, higher education is a major sector of public policy and constitutes a significant part of the public sector. Corruption in higher education, as well as the way it is addressed in legislation and court cases and reflected in the media, appears to be consistent with the trajectory and pace of reforms that take place in the higher education industry in the US and the RF. The reduction of governmentally funded studentships in the RF and the growing significance of private educational loans in the US lead to an increase in corruption in the area of access to higher education. The continuing massification of higher education, with increasing enrollment rates in both countries, as well as the emergence of the for-profit sector, necessitate more control and coordination on the part of the governments, educational institutions, and the public. Growing public concerns over the quality of educational services lead to an increase in reporting bribery, fraud, cheating, plagiarism, diploma mills, breach of contract, and other forms of misconduct. A better understanding of corruption in national higher education is needed in order to design effective anti-corruption strategies.
0	Manifest Destiny and the state of scientific and medical knowledge converged to encourage migration of healthseekers (i.e., people seeking climactic cures from diseases, such as tuberculosis) across the West starting in the 19th century.  Local officials, interested in promoting urban growth, capitalized on this phenomenon by aggressively advertising for healthseekers.  This paper analyzes the case of tuberculosis in Phoenix, Arizona, USA during its period of early growth (1880-1946) to demonstrate how social constructions of disease intersected with political constructions of race and class to produce pathologized bodies and stigmatized places.  Contradictions in Phoenixs pro-growth strategy are discussed in this paper, along with strategies employed by city leaders to solve them.  These strategies included an emergent discourse by those in power that served to construct race, class and place-based inequities.  Further, ideological and spatial strategies were instantiated to ensure that other Phoenix residents did not see the injustices being produced.  The material results of these discursive strategies included dilapidated housing, a lack of urban infrastructure, and lack of health care services for minorities and the poor in Phoenix.  Those in power, in the name of private accumulation and urban growth, had constructed a context in which poor persons with TB were spatially isolated and socially stigmatized while wealthy whites with TB were socially, culturally and environmentally advantaged.
0	This research questions the influence of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on American religious pluralism and the religious minority identity of Muslims living in the United States. Critical discourse analysis is used to examine stories from newspaper published in the northeast region of the United States and the Washington Post seven weeks prior to and following the attacks. The data reveal the media representations of Muslim Americans published before 9/11 are consistent with the religious diversity that is assumed by religious pluralism. Muslim Americans are simply another American religious community that seeks to advance and protect its interests as do other American minorities. Following September 11, media representations of fear and threat are used to create a boundary between Muslims and other Americans that is solidified by images that construct Islam as contradictory to American values and interests. This signals transformations in the meaning of religious minority identity for Muslim American and American religious pluralism.
0	The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) organization developed low cost, open-source XO laptops to be disseminated to children in third-world countries. Birmingham, Alabama has been the site of the largest dissemination of OLPC XO laptops in the United States to date. A former mayor of Birmingham purchased 15,000 XO laptops to be distributed to school children in Birmingham City schools. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this large-scale dissemination of XO laptops eliminated the digital divide in Birmingham or whether elements of the digital divide persist. Survey data from 1700+ elementary school children reveals that some elements of the digital divide have been reduced; however, significant components of the digital divide remain. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of one-to-one computing programs, the importance of teacher and school level factors, and the larger political context within Birmingham.
0	This presentation is the second half of a paper on how ‘characters’ have been used in sociological analysis. The first half of this paper—on how the history of characters through the ‘Chicago School’ has been a kind of hidden tradition alongside ecological models and community studies—was presented at the ESS. The second part of the article moves from an abridged chronology of the methodological choice of orienting a study around a central character type to an examination of 15 qualitative studies that develop character types in order to propose a set of eight emphases that will solidify the value of this methodological emphasis. This will serve to assist in analyzing past studies of the character as well as constructing future character types.
1	"Using data from a 2005 survey of U.S. workers, we find that a high percentage of employed men and women report that work interferes with nonwork life. This research offers three main contributions: (1) we document the social distribution of work-nonwork interference across social statuses and dimensions of stratification; (2) we develop a conceptual framework that specifies the influence of a comprehensive set of work resources and demands on interference and their contributions to its social distribution; and (3) we advance a ""stress of higher status"" perspective to understand the paradoxical influence of some work conditions on work-nonwork interference. Findings generally support both the demands hypothesis and the stress of higher status hypothesis, with patterns from both factors contributing substantially to the social distribution of work-nonwork interference. This article refines and elaborates the job demands-resources model with insights from border theory."
0	From its inception, cheerleading has been a distinctively American way of doing gender.  It began in the 19th-century as an exclusively masculine activity at elite colleges and universities.  By the middle of the 20th-century, however, cheerleading was largely identified with feminized qualities of enthusiastic boosterism and physical attractiveness.    In the current era, collegiate cheerleading has been transformed into an athletic performance in its own right, highlighting the gendered athleticism of both male and female participants.   Cheerleading thus provides a unique lens through which to view the transformation of the meanings and performances of both masculinity and femininity.   Despite the potent symbolism of cheerleading in American culture, it has received relatively little scholarly attention.   In this paper we trace the social construction of cheerleading as a gendered activity by examining photographs of cheerleaders in college yearbooks over a one hundred year period.   Our particular focus is on the construction of masculinity within cheerleading and its connection to larger historical changes in American society and culture
1	Beginning in 1938, some American business groups campaigned to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment and limit the federal taxation of income and wealth. Although their proposed upward-redistributive policy would benefit few voters, it won the support of 31 state legislatures. To explain this outcome, this article offers a theory of strategic policy crafting by advocacy groups. Such groups may succeed even in otherwise unfavorable institutional environments if they craft their proposals to fit the salient policy context. Archival evidence and event history analysis support this hypothesis. Public opinion also helps explain legislative support for upward-redistributive policy.
0	Drawing upon the labor process perspective, this paper extends Edwards (1979) thesis of control, exploring how direct, bureaucratic, and technical forms of control may be used to control consumers and social patterns of consumption. Outlining the role of consumption within Marxs theory of capitalism, the author presents control as the methods used by capitalists to obtain desired consumer behavior. Significant discussion is given to addressing each type of control, as well as providing examples of such forms in contemporary American society.  Concluding remarks suggest that other concepts associated with the labor process  including deskilling and worker consent  may provide additional insight in studies of consumption and consumer behavior.
0	Economy and society has been and remains a central concern of sociology throughout its history.  This project draws on an historical, natural quasi-experiment to explore sociology theory.  The data gathered on Japanese-administered POW camps reveals that the American, British and Australian POWs, despite being from such similar cultures - held very different economic ethics, and established distiinctly different moral economies in captiivity.  The British favoured a class-based hierarchical set of institutions; the Americans individualistic market-based institutions; and, the Australians egalitarian 'mateship' and communitarian institutions

Specifically, I argue that the extreme polarization of the abortion debate in the U.S. can be better understood by employing conceptual frameworks such as ""dichotomous thinking"" and ""categorization"" to understand how and why Americans identify as either ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice."""
0	The aim of this study is to show how invisible institutional culture participates in the production and propagation of gender difference and hierarchy. To that end, we examine the official publications of one Israeli university in order to explore cultural mechanisms that signify hidden conceptions, ideologies and iconic images of women in the academe. Conceptualizing these publications as cultural products that operate as the public image of the university and hence participate in its overall construction of ideologies of gendered reality, we analyze, both qualitatively and quantitatively, images, visual representations and scripts of university women as they appear in the university bulletins, president's reports, and various newsletters from 1974-2004 (in Hebrew and in English). Having looked at over 5,000 articles and photographs, we found that although the presence of women in the publications has increased over the years, their images and roles continue to be feminized and sexist. Thus, more space is devoted and more visibility given to stereotyped femininity and womanhood. Moreover, we explore the ways in which mechanisms that create a complex politics of visibility and invisibility produce contested and contradictory messages and participate in the creation of what we call the blind spots of discrimination.
1	Same-sex partners' familial expectations, including the division of household labor are not well-understood in the existing research-research that largely references the experiences of white, middle- and upper-income lesbians who develop relationships with egalitarian goals. This article uses qualitative and survey research methods to evaluate the common view that two elements of feminist egalitarian ideology-economic independence and the equal distribution of housework and childrearing-are the defining features of lesbian-headed households. Analyses of 32 black women in lesbian step families suggest that partners share the providing role but biological mothers undertake significantly more household chores. More chore responsibility is used as a trade-off for greater authority over other aspects of household organization, including family finances and childrearing. The biological mother control in a family is largely a function of her legal tie to a child and greater perceived responsibility for the child well-being. Notably, this pattern persists even when she earns less than her mate. Without the gender structure of male privilege or the material advantage of high income, these families associate control over household labor with greater relationship power. These findings, while derived from analyses of a unique population, hold implications for broader conceptions of gender and power with families, the bases of interactional power and the internal manifestations of power across various family and couple types.
1	Much research attention has been devoted to understanding the relationship between education and riskier sex-related behaviors and HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. While in the early 1990s researchers found that increases in education were associated with a higher incidence of HIV/AIDS, this relationship appears to have reversed and better educated people, especially women, appear less likely to engage in riskier sex-related behaviors and have a lower incidence rate of HIV/AIDS. Our study begins to unravel the mechanisms that could explain why women's educational attainment is associated with safer sex-related behaviors in sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from the 2003 Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey, we examine the potential mediating effects of HIV/AIDS knowledge, family planning discussions, gender empowerment, and husband's education for explaining the relationship between education and age of first sex, casual sex, multiple sex partners, and condom use. We find that gender empowerment partially explains the relationship between education and age of first sex, and HIV/AIDS knowledge, husband's education, and family planning discussions partially explain the relationship between education and condom use. We argue that gender inequality and lack of knowledge are likely to play a greater role in explaining the relationship between woman's education and sex-related behaviors in sub-Saharan Africa than they do in more industrialized nations, where social capital explanations may have more explanatory power.

1	This research applies a transaction-focused institutional analysis to compare the value of political capital in different institutional domains of China's market economy Our results show that the value of political capital is associated with institutional domains of the economy in which agents can use political connections to secure advantages. Political capital is most fungible in institutional domains where government restricts economic activity. In this sense, the value of political connections in China does not differ fundamentally from patterns observable in established market economics. We interpret this as evidence suggesting China may have experienced a tipping point in its transition to a market economy around the turn of the new century.
0	This paper will serve as a critical review of what has been written on Mexicans and what is missing from its analysis.  More specifically this paper will focus on those who have professional careers and are not employed in low-skilled occupations.  By citing the general demographics of Mexicans and concentrating the bulk of the paper on in-depth analysis on Mexican professionals, this paper will show why it is important to begin to study this group.   Some of my research questions are 1) What are the demographic characteristics of these groups that distinguishes them from other Latinos 2) How will this growing professional population affect how other Latinos are perceived in society and 3) Are there any gender differences between Mexican women and men who are professionals?
0	This paper examined race and gender differences in depressive and alcohol disorders. Using data from the 2003 National Survey of Drugs and Health (NSDUH, N =29375), the analysis used Mplus to estimate and test a four group structural model for black and white women and men. Based on hypotheses derived from the scholarship on the intersection of race and gender, we proposed that race and gender differences reflect not only differences in levels of material resources, but also differences in the ways these resources combine to influence mental health. The structural model then captures major dimensions of the pathways to mental health. With regards to depressive disorder, the most striking findings are that material resources show greater mental health benefits for whites than for blacks, and especially for white women. Black men show the least benefit from material resources.  In contrast, we found similar and much smaller beneficial effects of material resources on alcohol disorders across the four groups. Our results underscore the need for more mental health research that accounts for how race may work differently for men and women and how gender may be experienced and reacted to in different ways by blacks and whites.
1	Anti-immigration attitudes and its origins have been investigated quite extensively. Research that focuses on the evolution of attitudes toward immigration, however, is far more scarce. In this paper, we use data from the first three rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS) to study the trend of anti-immigration attitudes between 2002 and 2007 in 17 European countries. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the critical legitimacy for comparing latent variable means over countries and time. A Multiple-Group Multiple Indicator Structural Equation Modeling (MGSEM) approach is used to test the cross-country and cross-time equivalence of the variables under study. In a second step, we try to offer an explanation for the observed trends using a dynamic version of group conflict theory. The country-specific evolutions in attitudes toward immigration are shown to coincide with national context factors, such as immigration flows and changes in unemployment rates. 
1	By developing the concept of ''gastronationalism,'' this article challenges conceptions of the homogenizing forces of globalism. I analyze (1) the ways in which food production, distribution, and consumption can demarcate and sustain the emotive power of national attachment and (2) how nationalist sentiments, in turn, can shape the production and marketing of food. The multi-methodological analyses reveal how the construct of gastronationalism can help us better understand pan-national tensions in symbolic boundary politics-politics that protect certain foods and industries as representative of national cultural traditions. I first analyze the macro-level dimensions of market protections by examining the European Union's program for origin-designation labels that delineates particular foods as nationally owned. The micro-level, empirical case-the politics surrounding foie gras in France-demonstrates how gastronationalism functions as a protectionist mechanism within lived experience. Foie gras is an especially relevant case because other parties within the pan-national system consider it morally objectionable. Contemporary food politics, beyond the insights it affords into symbolic boundary politics, speaks to several arenas of sociological interest, including markets, identity politics, authenticity and culture, and the complexities of globalization.
1	Questions of symbolic classification have been central to sociology since its earliest days, given the relevance of distinctions for both affiliation and conflict. Music and its genres are no exception, organizing people and songs within a system of symbolic classification. Numerous studies chronicle the history of specific genres of music, but none document recurrent processes of development and change across musics. In this article, we analyze 60 musics in the United States, delineating between 12 social, organizational, and symbolic attributes. We find four distinct genre types-Avant-garde, Scene-based, Industty-based, and Traditionalist. We also find that these genre types combine to form three distinct trajectories. Two-thirds originate in an Avant-garde genre, and the rest originate as a scene or, to our surprise, in an Industry-based genre. We conclude by discussing a number of questions raised by our findings, including the implications for understanding symbolic classification infields other than music.
1	The U.S. census data reveal high concentrations of same-sex unmarried partners in areas along the U.S.-Mexico border. In this article, I consider whether the above-average prevalence rates of same-sex unmarried partners along the U.S.-Mexico border can be attributed to measurement error. whether they provide evidence of enclave-like areas for Hispanic same-sex partners, or some combination thereof. Drawing on descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses, I examine data validity issues, as well as possible explanations for the high presence of gay men and lesbians in these particular residential locations. In doing so, I pay particular attention to the role of ethnicity, language, and household size in creating potential measurement error, as well as in generating attractive enclave characteristics. These findings provide insight into both the validity of the U.S. census data on same-sex unmarried partners, as well as the role of the intersection of sexual orientation and Hispanic ethnicity in determining residential choice. Although undoubtedly measurement error is a contributing factor, findings nonetheless Support the existence of actual gay and lesbian enclaves and further suggest that immigration could play a role in generating these high concentration areas. 
0	Social stratification scholars have, for some time, denoted processes of social closure that exclude or limit the access of subordinate groups to valued resources and institutions. Housing represents one such arena within which processes of closure may play out  a fact denoted by the substantial literature on racial residential segregation and its persistence.  The literature on housing discrimination has articulated well processes of social exclusion, mostly through the use of large aggregate housing audits.  Yet, we continue to know little about other dimensions of housing discrimination, particularly interactional and day-to-day processes that occur once minorities are housed.    Important to any conceptualization or analyses of social closure, we suggest, is explicit recognition of its exclusionary and interactional dimensions  two distinct, yet mutually reinforcing, dimensions that reproduce inequality.  Analyses, which draw on unique qualitative and quantitative data on over 1,000 serious housing discrimination cases that occurred between 1988 and 2002, highlight the utility of our approach.  Specifically, analyses reveal both exclusionary and day-to-day interactional forms of housing discrimination, how they unfold, who they affect, and the unique consequences of each for inequality. Results inform prior work on housing segregation by systematically delineating how discrimination may be playing a role in generating aggregate segregation patterns highlighted in prior work, while also extending conceptualization to patterns of interactional harassment that affect individuals everyday residential lives. We conclude by discussing the implications of our argument and analyses for the future conceptualization and study of processes of housing discrimination.
0	This paper examines the influence of migrant specific labor market segregation on the wages of migrants and non-migrants in Germany. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study and the German Microcensus we test several sociological and social-psychological explanations relevant to this topic. The notion of Quality Sorting states that the differences in wages that are associated with the migrant share within occupations are due to differences in human capital and qualification requirements in those jobs alone. In contrast, a Cultural Devaluation of occupations with a high migrant share should have a further negative influence on both migrants’ and natives’ wages. Finally, Inter-Group Conflict approaches predict that conflicts between non-migrants and migrants increase when the latter group is expanding which leads to additional disadvantages for migrants: the negative effect of the migrant share within an occupation on wages should be stronger for migrants than for non-migrants. In our results we find evidence for all these approaches: The effect of the share of migrants is reduced but not removed completely by including dimensions of quality sorting. Overall, the inequality that results from migrant-specific segregation is stronger for women than for men. Conversely, evidence for Inter-Group Conflicts emerges only for males and only after removing highly skilled/managerial positions from the sample. This indicates that in higher labor market positions the migrant/non-migrant inequality is lower.
0	This paper revisits the question of why people join social movements by focusing on a representative group of progressive activists and asking them to reconstruct their ‘pathways to participation’ using the concepts of biography, identity, networks, culture, and critical events that previous research has identified as causes for individual participation.  This ‘reconstruction’ reveals that activists narrate their ‘coming to activism’ in interactive and recursive ways, reworking, rejecting, or reinterpreting the meanings contained in each of these conceptual categories.  In addition, these activists stake out two different pathways to participation defined roughly on the basis of class and race. One group of primarily middle class (and white) activists construct a pathway defined by a set of experiences from family socialization, social networks, and cultural spaces which leads them to shift their self-understandings from vaguely liberal, religious, radical etc. to one ideologically committed to progressive activism.  Another group of primarily working class (and non-white) activists constructs a pathway defined by a set of experiences around marginalized social identities and the cultural spaces and social networks that nurture and transform these identities into oppositional and action-oriented formations.  These conclusions provide insight into how culture operates in the recruitment process and into the persistence of inequality in social movements.
1	This article highlights the shifting boundaries between the public and private spheres in advanced capitalist societies through an examination of grassroots lobbying firms. These organizations, which became a fixture in U.S. politics in the 1970s and have grown in number and prominence since, subsidize public participation on behalf of corporations, industry groups, and associations using direct mail, telephoning, and by mobilizing members and stakeholders. I examine the dynamics of this organizational population whose existence calls attention to broad transformations in civil society-with reference to dramatic growth in the organizational populations of civic and trade associations. Results, derived from a Generalized Estimating Equation panel regression of firm founding events across U.S. regions from 1972 to 2002, suggest that the increasing formal organization of civil society has supported the development of a field of organizations that subsidize participation. These organizations do so, however, in a manner that restricts the development of social capital and civic skills while augmenting the voice of private interests in public and legislative discourse.
0	Using the latest 1998-2000 GSS data, this study examines what kinds of parents tend to select nonpublic schools for their children. The results of logistic regression analysis show that parents who are Christian, who are older, who have higher socioeconomic status, and who live in the Northeast and Midwest are more likely than their respective counterparts to send their children to religious schools against public schools.  However, there are no significant racial, gender, or urban/rural differences in parental choice of religious schools.  Parental socioeconomic status is the key factor in determining their choice of nonreligious private schools. Other factors do not make significant differences in the selection of private schools. Currently, no significant differences in demographic, religious, socioeconomic, and family structure characteristics can be detected with regard to which parents are more likely to home school their children.
1	In what way do movements move? What do we mean by the movement Of movements? While still a rather unconventional stance, I advance the argument that social movements are, at root, culture production agents. Regardless of whatever else they may accomplish, movements produce new cultural forms in the course of struggle; they often change and augment cultural stock in the process, and sometimes live on for generations in collective memory. My answer to the query follows a movement-centered production and circulation of culture template organized around several major moments Of culture moves: moving across space, moving emotions, moving social-cultural conditions and moving through memory. I illustrate culture moves in these four moments using sociological and historical studies of the long civil rights movement, suggesting a variety of research agendas along the way.
1	The inequality in the relative years of education between blacks and whites has diminished dramatically over the 20th century. One possible explanation for this convergence is a virtuous cycle of parents passing on educational advantage, from one generation to the next, leading to an overall educational upgrading. In this paper we test the virtuous cycle hypothesis by estimating the three way interaction of cohort, race, and family background. We find that the convergence in educational attainment between blacks and whites over the past century was driven by processes unrelated to family background. 
1	Having an unintended birth is associated with maternal and child health outcomes, the mother-child relationship, and subsequent fertility. Unintended fertility likely also increases the risk of union dissolution for parents, but it is unclear whether this association derives from a causal effect or selection processes and whether it differs by union type. This article uses data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth to compare union stability after intended and unintended births in coresidential relationships. Results show that coresidential couples are more likely to break up after an unintended first or higher-order birth than after an intended first or higher-order birth, even when accounting for stable unobserved characteristics using fixed-effects models. The negative association is stronger for marriages than cohabitations, despite the overall higher dissolution rate of cohabiting unions. We conclude that unintended fertility at any parity is disruptive for coresidential couples in ways that increase the risk of union dissolution. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	Education and fertility (including childrearing) are foundational processes in societal metabolism, and the relationship between them can have profound, long-term effects on a variety of institutions, including the labor market, the family, (especially care for the elderly), and educational institutions themselves. In postindustrial countries, conventional wisdom holds that there is a strong inverse relationship between education and completed fertility, but this has not been carefully examined in recent decades, and the topic has been almost completely neglected for men. In this article, we address these core questions and relations, drawing on the Norwegian population registers for cohorts born 1940 to 1964. Among women, the relationship between completed fertility and educational level attained at age 39 has become substantially less negative. In all cohorts, better-educated women have later first births and remain childless more often than do the less educated. The negative effect of education on higher-order birth rates net of the impact of later motherhood has, however, disappeared. Family-friendly ideologies and policies, including better access to high-quality daycare, are likely the engine behind this shift. Among men, a positive relationship has emerged: the better educated become fathers later than others, but fewer remain childless, and there has been an increasingly stimulating effect of education on second- and third-birth rates. We discuss these sex differences in light of the persistent differences between mothers' and fathers' roles.
0	It is well known that routine rulebreaking is a common feature of most bureaucracies; but despite this, efforts to explain rulebreaking remain theoretically fragmented. Here we identify two central dimensions of bureaucratic rulebreaking and then develop a coherent model of it as a structurally patterned and interactionally mediated sociological fact. First, rulebreaking may be permitted or contested by those formally charged with rule enforcement.  Widespread manifestations of rulebreaking take on a routine character only where it is unofficially allowed; where it is not, conflict ensues. Second, the hierarchical structure of bureaucracy is mirrored by an organizational hierarchy of rulebreaking.  Rulebreaking can be undertaken by individuals acting alone; it can be organized at the level of work groups; or it can be organized by top management as a matter of unofficial policy. Considering how these two dimensions of rulebreaking interact provides insight into how social action in the form of rule breaking varies with respect to the full range of organizational cross-pressures. Finally, the framework and typology we develop offers an important corrective to the sociological over-reliance on the formal aspects of Weber’s theorizing and has considerable utility for generating hypotheses about rulebreaking across an array of organizational and institutional arenas.
1	What happens to family relations when an adolescent and her parent do not share the same religious convictions or practices? Whereas previous work on religion and intergenerational relations looks at relationships between parents and their adult children, we shift the focus to younger families, assessing how parent-child religious discord affects adolescents' evaluation of their relationship with their parents. Exploring data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find several interesting patterns of association between religious discord and parent-child relations. Overall, religious discord predicts lower quality intergenerational relations. When parents value religion more than their teens do, adolescents tend to report poorer relations with parents. Relationship quality is not lower, however, when it is the adolescent who values religion more highly. We also find that religious discord is more aggravating in families where parent and child share religious affiliation and in families where the parent is an evangelical Protestant. 
0	Many sociologists and economists have maintained that costly sanctions indeed are able to create and sustain cooperation, but under which conditions carrots or sticks are more successful in this respect still an unsettled issue. Dari-Mattiacci and De Geest (2009) recently clarify that the multiplication effect related to sticks is a plausible theoretical explanation for the superiority of sticks. However, there are also more behavioral arguments from which one could maintain that carrots might work better than sticks, for example, because they do not undermine the cohesion of the group as sticks might do. This experimental study investigates whether in a simple experimental setting sticks and carrots differ in their effectiveness in maintaining cooperation. Our results show that while carrots do increase cooperation, sticks turn out to be more effective in our experiment. In addition, we do not find that the group cohesion becomes stronger in the condition with carrots although giving rewards produces positive feelings towards the group.
0	This exploratory paper examines the role of biomedical knowledge and practices in the perpetuation of colonial rule by focusing on the institutional development of biomedicine and public health measures in colonial India. I adopt Michel Foucaults theory of biomedicine as a 'new technology of power' which at the individual level is centrally focused on the human body as an object and target of power, and at the collective level aided political power in controlling populations through public health measures. Following historical literature on colonial India, I argue that introduction of biomedicine in the colonies was as much an administrative necessity as it was a part of a larger project of cultural hegemony and the spread of Western ideas, institutions and practices.
1	Based on Boyce and Ellis' model on context and biological sensitivity to the context, this article analyzes the interaction between the experience of daily hassles and experimentally induced cardiovascular reactivity as an indicator of stress reactivity in explaining risk taking and self-esteem This study found, in a sample of 599 adolescents, that (1 daily hassles were more strongly related to risk taking in boys and girls with high vs low levels of cardiovascular reactivity and (2 taking Into account the gendered experience of daily hassles was important in predicting outcomes for stress-reactive boys and girls These results indicate that a biosocial approach may result in an increased understanding of the variability in the outcomes of stressors
1	Investigating immigrant residential patterns in 1880 offers a baseline for understanding residential assimilation trajectories in subsequent eras. This study uses 100% count information from the 1880 Census to estimate a multilevel model of ethnic isolation and exposure to native whites in 67 cities for individual Irish, German and British residents. At the individual level, the key predictors are drawn from assimilation theory: nativity, occupation, and marital status. The multilevel model makes it possible to control for these predictors and to study independent sources of variation in segregation across cities. There is considerable variation at the city level, especially due to differences in the relative sizes of groups. Other significant city-level predictors of people's neighborhood composition include the share of group members who are foreign-born, the disparity in occupational standing between group members and native whites, and the degree of occupational segregation between them.

0	Is there a moral code for resistance? Is there a moral responsibility towards the enemy? What does it mean to be responsible for the enemy? If the enemy is the other that cannot be separated from self, any irresponsible act towards the enemy will turn one way or the other into an irresponsible act towards oneself. Therefore, perceptions of the enemy are not separated from perceptions of ones self and group. As such, deciding on an ideology (philosophy) and methodology of fighting the enemy will not just impact on the enemy, but ultimately will reflect on ones self and group. Consequently, being morally responsible towards the enemy is not an altruistic act and charitable gesture towards the enemy, as much as it is an act of self-interest and personal and collective responsibility towards self and society. This paper will reflect on these issues, answering some of the above stated questions, and reflecting on how America has thus far engaged in its war against terrorism, and how this impacts Arabs, Arab Americans, and Muslim Americans.
0	Within the hospitality industry, it is common to identify trends of racial/ethnic dominance in certain occupations, particularly in low-wage low-skilled positions.  It is not unusual to find a housekeeping staff dominated by Hispanic women.  Nor is it uncommon to find their male counterparts serving as prep cooks and other back-of-house assistants in physically demanding positions within the Food and Beverage unit of the industry.  This thesis aims to explore both the effects the growing low-wage immigrant population has on organized labor (unions) and the hospitality workplace, as well as the converse dynamic of the unions on the immigrants.  Furthermore, this exposition will be outlined within both the Metropolitan Statistical Area of Clark County, Nevada (which is largely dominated by Las Vegas) as well as within the Mexican-origin population of the county and city.  Las Vegas, indeed, presents a unique situation in its idiosyncratic being as an icon of successful lodging, food and beverage, gaming, and tourism destinations in a dynamic co-existence.  The examination of organized labor is relevant because of the historical importance the Mexican immigrant population has had on social movements, specifically related to labor force participation in the Southwest (re: farm labor studies).  In essence, behavioral patterns similar to those of the farm labor movements are occurring in Las Vegas within organized labor of the hospitality industry and a study of this nature thus has justifiable utility for managers, owners, the line workforce itself, and the consuming society at large.
0	There is a great deal of excitement in the Sociology of culture over the possibility of formal analysis of systems of meaning.  Existing studies have examined relatively simple meaning structures using relatively simple data with fruitful results.  But significantly less work has explored the benefits of formal methods for understanding complex meaning structures such as those found in philosophical texts.  How can we analyze meaning structures as complex as philosophical concepts?  How can we use these meaning structures to understand how people reconstruct old ideas to create new ones?  In the following, I employ a novel semantic method to model the conceptual structure of Juergen Habermas’s Theory of Communicative Action.  The method reproduces in schematic form the process whereby Habermas developed his idea of communicative action through critique of Weber’s theory of rationality and Parsons’s theory of the social system.  This method also allows us to locate similarity and change among conceptual structures created by different theorists.  I apply the same formal techniques to texts by Max Horkheimer and Axel Honneth to expose how the concept of “rationality” formed cultural ties among leaders of the three generations of Frankfurt School “Critical Theory” and how new understandings of “rationality” are constructed from elements of old ones.
1	This article offers an innovative theoretical approach to black-white labor market inequality that combines components of threat, spatial mismatch, and urban decline theories in a queuing framework. Using a unique measure-the earnings gap between black and white workers resulting from sorting into different occupations within an occupationally and educationally delimited labor queue-the author tests hypotheses from the combined model. Results show support for the combined model, as characteristics of labor and job queues significantly influence the extent of black-white inequality. Variables representing employers' preferences for or against hiring black workers are also significant, suggesting the utility of jointly examining preferences and processes in the labor market.
1	"Longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics are used to examine patterns and determinants of migration into neighborhoods of varying racial and ethnic composition. Consistent with spatial assimilation theory, higher income and education facilitate moving into neighborhoods containing proportionally more non-Hispanic whites and, among Latinos, the native-born move to ""More Anglo"" neighborhoods than immigrants. Consistent with place stratification theory, blacks move to neighborhoods with significantly fewer Anglos than do comparable Latinos, and the effect of income on migration into more Anglo neighborhoods is stronger for most minority groups than for Anglos. Latinos differ only slightly from Anglos in their migration into neighborhoods with large black populations, and blacks do not differ from Anglos in their migration into neighborhoods with large Latino populations."
0	In this paper, we examine the roles that neighborhood factors are playing in American adults shifting energy balance.  Data for this investigation come from the Utah Population Data Base (UPDB). The UPDB contains vast data holdings including records about genealogies, births, deaths, residences, health status, residential address, and height/weight.  For these analyses, U.S. Census information on neighborhood characteristics measured at the block-group level has also been linked to the UPDB using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) databases.   This unique linked data set allows us to assess the extent to which neighborhood design, population density, and land-use diversity may be associated with American adults growing propensity to be overweight for an entire urban county population in Utah.
0	High school coursetaking and achievement in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics courses predict future Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) bachelors degree attainment.  Using the population of public university college graduates among a statewide cohort of high school graduates, this study compares the likelihood of STEM attainment of high- and low-achieving students in Honors, Advanced Placement (AP), and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses to that of students who earned an A in general Biology, Chemistry, and Physics courses.  This study finds that almost regardless of achievement, students who complete AP/IB Chemistry and AP Physics B and C courses are significantly more likely than A students in general courses.  A grade of B in Physics I Honors is equivalent to an A in Physics I.  Women and African-American students are significantly less likely to take these key courses compared to Chemistry I and Physics I.
0	This paper examines the influence of rural- to urban migration on early school dropout from compulsory education through effects of social capital drawn from community, in a sample of Turkish youth. The loss of community-based sources of social capital may be the underlying reason for significantly lower levels of school attainment of immigrant youth in comparison to native youth in culturally diverse societies. In the present study, with a sample of 764 adolescents, we show that rural to urban migration at school age (5-15 years) increases a child’s odds of dropping out from compulsory education about 103% compared to when the child is not migrated, above and beyond other significant structural risk factors like child labor, having illiterate mothers and no stable house income. The effect of migration on dropping out is significant for adolescents who migrated to the metropolitan Istanbul, but not to other less developed cities, which are similar to the immigrants’ home cities in terms of socio-economic and cultural milieu. Positive student-teacher relationship as a form of school social capital increased the odds of staying in school by 65%. We suggest that social capital factors are critical in the educational attainment and acculturation of migrant children and interventions should target immigrant children, their families and the communities they live in.
0	With very little public attention, and practically no academic attention, Indian Americans have come to own over half of the nations motels. In fact, practically all of the owners are from a single state within India, Gujarat, and have the last name Patel. This research concentrates on how these actors run their motels as immigrant entrepreneurs. They fit a middleman minority profile to a certain extent. The findings explain their role as immigrant capitalists relative to their employees, including those within their family. Indian Americans get ahead by reifying gender, racial, ethnic and class stratifications, within and outside of their communities, rather than relying only on ethnic social capital, other ethnic resources, or a notion of self-reliance in the face of structural inequalities. Owners even affirm their own marginal status as minorities relative to Whites. Yet instead of a picture of only increasing inequalities, people resist these hierarchies as well. Still, such agency does not challenge ultimately their group statuses. The findings shed light on how immigrant entrepreneurs use various stratifications, in particular race relative to the majority which remains under-analyzed.
1	Adversity early in life may alter pathways of aging, but what interpretive processes can soften the blow of early insults? Drawing from cumulative inequality theory, the authors analyze trajectories of life evaluations and then consider whether early adversity offsets favorable expectations for the future. Results reveal that early adversity contributes to more negative views of the past but rising expectations for the future. Early adversity also has enduring effects on life evaluations, offsetting the influence of buoyant expectations. The findings draw attention to the limits of human agency under the constraints of early adversity a process described as biographical structuration.
1	This article places the choice to claim welfare benefits in a social context by studying how neighborhood welfare receipt affects welfare receipt among couples in Stockholm, Sweden. It is expected that the propensity to claim welfare should increase with welfare use in the neighborhood, primarily through stigma reduction and increasing availability of information. 1 use individual-level panel data (N = 1,595,843) for the Stockholm County population during the 1990s, data that contain a wide range of information and allow extensive controls for observed and unobserved confounding factors. The results from pooled and fixed-effects logistic regressions suggest that welfare receipt among people in the same neighborhood substantially increases the number of households entering the welfare system (inflow), but the effects on outflow are negligible.
1	Practices of design, although integral to contemporary capitalism, are too often overlooked by economic sociologists. To remedy this, I study a novel technology of organizational adornment: theming. Case data drawn from the global casino industry reveal that theming has diffused worldwide as standard business practice. Close examination, however, reveals divergence across jurisdictions in terms of the meanings that themes convey. These patterns derive from neither successful marketing (i.e., customizing design for consumers) nor symbolic isomorphism (i.e., signaling deference to global norms). In line with the markets-as-politics paradigm, I analyze design as a field-specific conception of control. In this view, themes signal to particular constituencies that one is a certain kind of organization (and not another). The makeup of these signals and audiences-that is, what counts as socially legitimate action-will depend on the political field in which a firm is embedded. Results demonstrate the explanatory power of markets-as-politics and also extend this theory by elucidating the performative mechanisms that bridge economic and political domains.
1	In the sociological literature on social mobility, the long-standing convention has been to assume that intergenerational reproduction takes one of two forms: a categorical form that has parents passing on a big-class position to their children or a gradational form that has parents passing on their socioeconomic standing. These approaches ignore in their own ways the important role that occupations play in transferring opportunities from one generation to the next. In new analyses of nationally representative data from the United States, Sweden, Germany, and Japan, the authors show that (a) occupations are an important conduit for social reproduction, (b) the most extreme rigidities in the mobility regime are only revealed when analyses are carried out at the occupational level, and (c) much of what shows up as big-class reproduction in conventional mobility analyses is in fact occupational reproduction in disguise.
0	This paper examines the ways in which a blues club called Ground Zero, owned by the actor Morgan Freeman in the purported home of the blues, Clarksdale, Mississippi constructs itself as authentic. Textual analysis of its website and other sources is used to explore how the club portrays itself to blues fans and non-blues fans alike. Ground Zeros use of familiar cultural symbols to signify a specific kind of blues authenticity is also examined--these symbols include a select variety of musicians, folk art and folk objects, as well as particular kinds of southern food. This paper also analyzes how authenticity can be established through a connection to geographical place and looks at the racial politics surrounding this endeavor in Ground Zeros case. Finally, the notion of authenticity itself is destabilized, and implications for future research on this topic involving the analysis of other establishments such as the House of Blues is discussed.
0	The world's economy turns into liberalization rapidly after the WTO agreement, and the ICT industry plays an important role in the era. Though ICT is important in the information society, there are still some debates on the impacts of liberalization. It is important to the policy makers to do regulation, especially in price and laws , and maybe privatization is the best possible means to policy makers now. But the process of liberalization has several implications and impacts to the society. For example, the liberalization policy in Taiwan has introduced competition mechanism successfully, but there will be some problems in labor, culture, even the switch-offphenomena (Castells,2000) in a information society. This study aims at the phenomena by using Taiwans experience to discuss several dimensions of the liberalization process, and hope it can bring some useful information to the developing countries.
1	We estimate the effects of attending the first versus second-tier of higher education institutions on Chinese students' at-college and expected post-college outcomes using various quasi-experimental methods such as regression discontinuity, genetic matching, and regression discontinuity controlling for covariates. Overall we find that just attending the first versus second-tier makes little difference in terms of students' class ranking, net tuition, expected wages, or likelihood of applying for graduate school. The results do show, however, that just attending the first versus second tier makes it less likely that students will get their preferred major choice. 
1	Women's wages do not grow with experience or tenure as much as men's do. Many accounts of this cumulative gender disadvantage attribute it to women's underinvestment in firm-specific skills. Yet if that were true, this disadvantage would not exist where firm-specific skills are not rewarded by the labor market. This article investigates this argument in the context of contract employment, where demand for firm specificity is minimal. Contrary to expectations, men still receive higher rewards than women over time. Drawing on quantitative evidence and qualitative fieldwork using job histories of high-skill contractors affiliated with a staffing firm, the author finds support for two sources of women's disadvantage: lower rates of movement across clients on the supply side and unmeasured demand-side factors by which similar levels of tenure and client transitions accrue lower rewards to women. Implications for research on gender stratification and career advancement in non-formalized labor markets are discussed.
0	"In recent decades, culture has re-emerged as a central object of study in political sociology and, to a somewhat lesser degree, in political science as well. However, the study of the interaction between culture and politics raises several significant methodological and theoretical questions that this burgeoning literature has not yet conclusively resolved. First, in the context of this literature on the impact of culture on politics, how should the explanatory variable be defined and conceptualized? Second, what methodological rules should researchers follow when studying the causal impact of culture on political action and policy outcomes? Finally, through what processes or mechanisms does culture affect politics? This paper explores the different ways in which the current sociological and political science literature has addressed these questions. It focuses particularly on strategies for operationalizing ""implicit"" culture as an explanatory variable, on methods for improving the rigor of interpretive methods, and on the identification of causal mechanisms to explain how culture both constrains and constitutes political action."
1	Longitudinal social network data on adolescents in seven schools are analyzed to reach a new understanding about how the personal and interpersonal social dimensions of adolescent religion intertwine together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1) social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed.

1	Earlier research has indicated a negative relationship between ethnic diversity and trust. Whereas previous analyses have been carried out at the country, city or neighbourhood level, this paper adds to the literature by analyzing the impact of ethnic diversity on generalized trust in others and out-group trust in the primary school context. The question of the impact of ethnic diversity in school on the trust of schoolchildren is addressed by drawing on a unique survey of children with immigrant and native Danish backgrounds, respectively, in the last three grades of primary school in Denmark. The survey design holds several qualities strengthening the potential for drawing inference about the impact of ethnic diversity in school on trust. The results of the analysis do not confirm the negative relationship between ethnic diversity and trust found in earlier research. In the primary school setting, ethnic diversity does not affect generalized trust and even has a positive impact on out-group trust of native Danish pupils (i.e., their trust in immigrants). 
1	In this paper, we consider the following question for the analysis of data obtained in longitudinal panel designs: How should repeated-measures data be modeled and interpreted when the outcome or dependent variable is dichotomous and the objective is to determine whether the within-person rate of change over time varies across levels of one or more between-person factors? Standard approaches address this issue by means of generalized estimating equations or generalized linear mixed models with logistic links. Using an empirical example and simulated data, we show (1) that cross-level product terms from these models can produce misleading results with respect to whether the within-person rate of change varies across levels of a dichotomous between-person factor; and (2) that subgroup differences in the rate of change should be assessed on an additive scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the probability of disease) rather than on a multiplicative scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the odds of disease). Because usual approaches do not provide a significance test for whether the rate of additive change varies across levels of a between-person factor. sample differences in the rate of additive change may be due to sampling error. We illustrate how standard software can be used to estimate and test whether additive changes vary across levels of a between-person factor. 
0	Nikolas Kompridis has recently argued that there is nothing ‘more urgent today than to resist the sense that our possibilities are contracting or that they are exhausted’ in modern capitalist societies, and that critical theory has a major role to play in expanding our horizons of possibility. This paper draws on examples from educational work to illustrate how Kompridis’s philosophical project can be materialised in its articulation with a critical ethnographic method which illuminates the cultural practices through which intellectual and political possibilities are contracted and proliferated in lived experience. The paper also considers the affective politics of transformative cultural practice, and suggests that developing a reflexive sensibility to these experiences is a necessary part of strengthening our capabilities to articulate a grounded politics of possibility. The paper ultimately argues that struggles against domination in contemporary capitalist institutions demand a stronger articulation of critical philosophy with ethnographies of possibility in everyday life.
0	This article examines the interactional processes that foster the reproduction of gender inequality at work.  Ridgeway’s development of status construction theory (1991; 2006) offers a useful framework in examining gendered processes and mechanisms that connects micro-interactions with both structure and personal belief systems. Through in-depth interviews with male-to-female transsexuals (transwomen), the author uncovers the ways in which co-workers teach transwomen gender status beliefs after they transition to women and the effect these status beliefs have on transwomen’s subsequent behaviors. Results indicate, first, that many transwomen are assumed to be less competent, less knowledgeable, and ignored more often once they transition to women than they previously were as men, particularly in male-dominated employment contexts.  Notably, my findings also suggest that the extent of status loss is linked to the type of masculinity subjects exhibited before their transition – whether they exhibited an exalted or devalued form of masculinity.  Second, as status construction and expectation theory predicts, my findings indicate a self-fulfilling effect that occurs after their transition in which transwomen become less dominant and assertive, partly due to their co-workers’ differential treatment toward them.  This research has important implications for the ways in which gender status beliefs are exchanged at work and the broader impact that gendered interactions can have on men and women’s employment outcomes.
1	Corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and other organizational forms are major players in the sodal world. Recently, sociological scholarship on organizations has converged with research on the professions to discuss the ways in which professions are shaped or influenced by different organizational forms. In this article, I borrows from the notion of framing within social movement research to argue that organizational forms frame the bids of aspiring professionals. More specifically, I argue that certain organizational forms-such as that of the modern corporation-can aid would-be professionals in making their claims for professional recognition. Organizations do this, I argue, by providing aspiring professionals with a ready-made setting, rationale, and guarantees that make the newcomers more easily recognizable as professionals to outside audiences. I explore this argument by examining how the corporate form has facilitated private military contractors in their attempts to legitimate and develop this highly controversial new industry. The data are drawn from my interviews with private military contractors, state officials, and other interested parties surrounding private military corporations, as well as from archival data that detail the rise of the private military industry.
1	We introduce a method for measuring effective government and modeling its consequences for social well:ire at the individual level. Our focus is on the experiences of citizens living in African countries where famine remains a serious threat. ha government It is effective, it will be able to deliver goods that individuals need to improve their social welfare. At a minimum, effective governments facilitate reliable access to food for its citizens. We assess this conception of effective government via a multi-level model horn 17 sub-Saharan countries sampled in 2005 by Afrobarometer. We find that citizens who live in regions and in countries with a civil bureaucracy, reliable law enforcement and good infrastructure enjoy higher levels of food security than those who live in regions with weaker institutional penetration
1	This study examines the effect of the state on participation in human rights international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) from 1966 through 2006, using random effects negative binomial models. Civic participation in human rights INGOs is not responsive to human rights abuses of the state, but is affected by the institutional environment provided by the state. Two intertwined dimensions within the state, democracy and state capacity, are found to be important in explaining cross-national variation in this participation. Strong state capacity magnifies the effect of democracy. A strong democratic state generates the most favorable condition. A strong but authoritarian state, however, is the most unfavorable, because it has both the motive and the capacity to restrain its citizens' global civic engagement. In contrast, an authoritarian but weak state lacks adequate capacity to intervene, and thus tolerates more participation than its strong counterpart. Over time differential participation across different types of states has not been diminished. This study reveals the role of the state in mediating between local citizens and global civil society, and develops a state-centered explanation for unequal participation in human rights INGOs across countries.

1	This study investigated the links between marijuana use trajectories and marijuana abuse/dependence (DSM-IV) using five waves of data from 718 North American Indigenous adolescents between 10 and 17 years from eight reservations sharing a common language and culture. Growth mixture models indicated that 15% of youth began using by 11-12 years of age and that another 20% began shortly thereafter. These early users had odds of abuse/dependence 6.5 times larger than abstainers. Girls were also unexpectedly found to be particularly at risk of early use, and this did not reflect other background and psychosocial factors, including friend use. While the timing, patterns, and consequences of use were similar to those reported for alcohol use previously, the social influences on use differed in important ways. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

1	Across the globe, the debate over homosexuality continues, with great variation in public opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality, laws regulating same-sex unions and penalties for homosexual sex behaviors. Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality. Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

1	Using data from three waves of the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 1963), we examine associations between adolescent family experiences and young adult wellbeing across a range of indicators, including schooling, substance use, and family-related transitions. We compare children living with both biological parents, but whose parents differ in how often they argue, to children in stepfather and single-mother families, and we assess the extent to which differences can be understood in terms of family income and parenting practices. Findings suggest that parental conflict is associated with children's poorer academic achievement, increased substance use, and early family formation and dissolution. Living in single-mother and stepfather families tend to be more strongly associated with our indicators of well-being, although differences between these family types and living with high conflict continuously married parents are often statistically indistinguishable. Income and parenting largely do not account for associations between adolescent family type and later life outcomes. We conclude that while children do better, on average, living with two biological married parents, the advantages of two-parent families kare not shared equally by all. 
1	This article returns to a classic question of political economy: the zero-sum conflict between capital and labor over the division of the national income pie. A detailed description of labor's share of national income in 16 industrialized democracies from 1960 to 2005 uncovers two long-term trends: an increase in labor's share in the aftermath of World War II, followed by a decrease since the early 1980s. I argue that the working class's relative bargaining power explains the dynamics of labor's share, and I model inter- and intra-class bargaining power in the economic, political, and global spheres. Time-series cross-section equations predicting the short- and long-term determinants of labor's share support most of my theoretical arguments and the main findings are robust to alternative specifications. Results suggest that the common trend in the dynamics of labor's share of national income is largely explained by indicators for working-class organizational power in the economic (i.e., unionization and strike activity) and political (i.e., government civilian spending) spheres, working-class structural power in the global sphere (i.e., southern imports and foreign direct investments), and indirectly by an indicator for working-class integration in the intra-class sphere (i.e., bargaining centralization).
1	This study analyzes why the world's most economically advanced countries have deindustrialized over the last few decades. Previous research focuses on three causal factors: (1) rising consumer affluence and its propensity to increase demand for services more than for manufactured goods, (2) faster productivity growth in the manufacturing sector relative to other sectors, and (3) expanding trade linkages between the North and the South of the global economy. The relative importance of these factors, however, is not fully understood, because previous research has not tested all of these explanations simultaneously nor considered the indirect channels through which global trade may cause deindustrialization. This study tests the three factors with two-way fixed-effects regression models and panel data on 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2003. The results indicate that each factor makes significant contributions to deindustrialization, and that global trade exerts both direct and indirect effects on employment patterns in economically advanced countries, but that the single greatest factor comes from the steadily rising affluence of consumers in these countries.
0	The 2007 conference theme advocates working to understand and reverse trends toward corruption, inequality and war and helping to strengthen democratic forces. Present US foreign policies are indicative of these troubling trends, and need attention. This paper argues that we need a better understanding of both elite and mass participation in the social construction of war, and that a fruitful theoretical strategy for this purpose is to connect two important new research areas: the political sociology of culture and critical criminology of empire. These two research areas are exciting and relatively unexplored strands of their respective sub-disciplines. Both are important and relatively unexplored approaches which, together, can help us better understand intra-societal influences on foreign policy. In this paper I will compare these approaches, highlighting a few ideas around which we might combine them. Within this larger theoretical project, the emphasis here is on understanding the dynamics of public opinion about US foreign policy rule making and rule breaking.
1	"Conceptions of adulthood have changed dramatically in recent decades. Despite such changes, however, the notion that young people will eventually ""settle down"" and desist from delinquent behaviors is remarkably persistent. This article unites criminology with classic work on age norms and role behavior to contend that people who persist in delinquency will be less likely to make timely adult transitions. The empirical analysis supports this proposition, with both arrest and self-reported crime blocking the passage to adult status. The authors conclude that desisting from delinquency is an important part of the package of role behaviors that define adulthood."
0	Broadly, this paper examines the gendered association between how individuals rate their current financial situation, their BMI, and their self-evaluation of weight.  Self-evaluation of weight is a new addition to the existing literature on weight and socioeconomic-status because traditionally BMI is used as a proxy for adiposity.  As discussed further in the paper, BMI has many flaws that can negatively influence research that uses BMI as the sole predictor for excessive weight. In addition to using BMI, this paper also uses self-evaluation of weight as a predictor, which avoids some of the pitfalls of BMI and highlights how individuals feel they are meeting gendered cultural expectations of weight. The results that this study suggests are twofold.  First, because BMI does not capture the complex interaction of societal expectations and the self, it may not be as good of a measure for adiposity as is self-evaluation.  Second, the findings demonstrate how men’s and women’s self-evaluations of weight differ in predicting how they rate their finances.  Specifically, this study demonstrates that there is a positive association for men who report being about the right weight or somewhat overweight, while there is a negative association for women who report being very overweight.
1	This paper examines the impact of race, family background, and parental investments on a behavioral manifestation of educational expectations: where students apply to college. Submitting an application to colleges is an important step in the transition to college because the majority of four-year colleges require Students to apply before enrolling. This paper documents the effects of social origins on the selectivity of where high school seniors applied, based on a national sample from the class of 2004. The results show general support for the contention that social background and parental investments influence where students apply to college. Minority students are more likely to apply to selective colleges than comparable white students. Parental education is positively associated with the selectivity of the college to which students apply. Family structure and sibship size, however. are not associated with applying to a selective college. Parental economic and interactional investments are also associated with where students apply to college. I further examine the interplay between family background and race and find that family background exerts a uniform influence on where students apply irrespective of race and ethnic origin. 
0	Accountability is the global language of regulation and evaluation.  Although its meaning varies, accountability is now a master frame that synthesizes and expresses a complex of relations and concerns. Its presence suggests rectitude, democracy, efficiency; its absence, corruption, secrecy, waste. Being held accountable is a relationship imposed on more people doing different things in a broad range of organizations. While no serious person disputes the importance of accountability, of holding people and organizations responsible for their actions, scholars often fail to investigate its effects empirically. This neglect is important because the stakes of accountability are high and variable. Efforts to enact accountability absorb immense resources; standards devised in one context often generate different outcomes in other contexts; and procedures for accountability are mediated by local practices. Healthcare is one vast, contested site of accountability. Creating measures to hold healthcare providers accountable produces unwanted, unintended side effects. Just the balance between the benefits and side effects of drugs must be carefully considered, so too must the benefits and side effects of accountability. Too often, especially in relations of dependence, accountability has been imposed by outsiders without examining its sometimes self-defeating effects. We contribute to knowledge of the stakes of accountability by analyzing its meaning and effects in one important context, the treatment of HIV/AIDS. We document three significant side effects of accountability: changes in patterns of attention, the proliferation of positions devoted to accountability and the bureaucratic personalities that these positions sometime encourage, and changes in linkages between groups and organizations.
1	"Sociological theory and public discourse raise concerns about division, fragmentation, or attenuation in our collective life rooted in, among other things, racial or religious differences, but we know very little about how ordinary Americans imagine themselves as similar to and different from their fellow citizens. In a recent, nationally representative telephone survey (2003, N = 2081) we asked over 2,000 Americans whether the members of ten different racial/ethnic, religious, or social groups ""share your vision of America."" We used cluster analysis and found three patterns of responses to this set of questions, patterns that reflect differences in social location and correspond to different views of diversity, group stereotypes, and understandings of American society. We argue that what we find reveals different dimensions along which Americans draw symbolic boundaries in public life, and that how these boundaries are drawn is rooted in three different visions of America. Optimistic pluralists believe in the positive value of diversity and are unwilling to exclude people on the basis of religion, ethnicity, or lifestyle; critics of multiculturalism are critical of diversity and are wary about contemporary social changes and political and social ""out-groups;"" and cultural preservationists imagine an America with a moral order underpinned by shared values and a history of a unified white, Christian culture. In the conclusion, we discuss the implications of these findings for scholarship on multiculturalism and the ""culture wars,"" and we call for more research on how ordinary Americans interpret the meanings and implications of social differences in public life."
0	Since the passage of the NCLB legislation, public schools nationwide have undergone a systemic shift from focusing on the general student population and their aggregate scores to focusing on individual student achievement and NCLB subgroups. Maryland became the first state in the country to endorse a comprehensive reform of its school finance system, resulting in an increase of over 2 billion dollars in state funding over a 6-year period. As part of the evaluation of the effects of the increased state aid to public schools in Maryland, evaluators visited 150 schools and administrations of all 24 school districts in Maryland to identify practices that school and system administrators perceived to be highly effective in improving student achievement. Six systemic best practices were identified as having a significant impact on improving student achievement, especially when implemented together, including the following: strategic planning; data utilization for instructional decision-making, based on electronic data warehousing and ease of availability to teachers and administrators; Professional Learning Communities; ongoing, targeted professional development; teacher specialists; and differentiated instruction and an individualized approach to teaching and learning. The paper discusses utilization of these practices as well as others reported by principals of the schools we interviewed.
0	We explore the organizational context influencing the subjective experience of sex discrimination at work. Drawing from the previous literature addressing other work related experiences, such as workplace bullying and sexual harassment, we examine how experiences of workplace sex discrimination are affected by sex composition, culture, and relative power. Our findings indicate that the experience of sex discrimination is reduced for both women and men when they are part of the numerical majority of their work group. We also find that supportive workplace cultures curtail sex discrimination. We find little support, however, for the role of the relative power of workers in understanding the experience of workplace sex discrimination. We conclude by discussing the implications for future research.
1	"The changing demographic landscape of the United States calls for a reassessment of the societal impacts and consequences of so-called ""natural"" and technological disasters. An increasing trend towards greater demographic and socio-economic diversity (in part due to high rates of international immigration), combined with mounting disaster losses, have brought about a more serious focus among scholars on how changing population patterns shape the vulnerability and resiliency of social systems. Recent disasters, such as the Indian Ocean Tsunami (2004) and Hurricane Katrina (2005), point to the differential impacts of disasters on certain communities, particularly those that do not have the necessary resources to cope with and recover from such events. This paper interprets these impacts within the context of economic, cultural, and social capital, as well as broader human ecological forces. The paper also makes important contributions to the social science disaster research literature by examining population growth, composition, and distribution in the context of disaster risk and vulnerability. Population dynamics (e.g., population growth, migration, and urbanization) are perhaps one of the most important factors that have increased our exposure to disasters and have contributed to the devastating impacts of these events, as the case of Hurricane Katrina illustrates. Nevertheless, the scientific literature exploring these issues is quite limited. We argue that if we fail to acknowledge and act on the mounting evidence regarding population composition, migration, inequality, and disaster vulnerability, we will continue to experience disasters with greater regularity and intensity."
0	The paper has two goals. The first goal is to offer a spatio-temporal model for understanding the scientificity of social knowledge as a set of performative activities which mediate between science and politics. I then apply the model to the British case and argue that social science acquired academic prestige only after it emerged as an expertise in the political sphere, through the work of governmental commissions, and only after its influence and effects were felt, through legislation and policy, in the public sphere. My second goal is to show the important role played by Harriet Martineau, a social investigator and a famous popularizer of governmental reports who suffered from a severe hearing impairment, in the scientization of British politics and consequently in the development of Victorian Social Science. Using the spatio-temporal model, I suggest a phenomenological reading of Martineaus work. Martineaus biography reveals an interesting intersection between deafness, propensity toward visual knowledge, the materiality of writing reports about society (as opposed to the non-materiality of speaking), the wide circulation of these reports in the public sphere and, ultimately, the scientificity of social knowledge.
0	In this sample of urban young adults, women are more likely to be married and to have established their own residence whereas men are more likely to be single and living with their parents by early adulthood. The goal of our paper is explain these gender differences in residential and marital status by early adulthood. In a series of nested models, we consider the effects of five domainsearly adolescent behaviors, household/family dynamics, parenting strategies, external environment, and early adulthood standingon being married or being single and independent versus being single and living at home.  We are especially interested identifying whether parenting strategies differently affect womens and mens pathways out of the natal home.  Two interesting findings emerge. First, the pathway to marriage versus being single and having an independent residence differ. Second, the pathways out of the household are only moderately different for women and men; in particular, parenting strategies do not affect women and mens early adulthood status differently. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research.
0	The study of how group boundary is related to the economic achievements of immigrants is an important source of understanding immigrant integration that has not been fully explored.  Our study explores how blurred group boundaries experienced by immigrants in Toronto affect their earnings.    By focusing on blurred group boundary, the study advances the analysis of how group differences shape the income achievements of immigrants.  It moves the discussion back to the core of the assimilation perspective, which analyzes how integration, the reduction of group differences, affects the life chances of immigrants.  Drawing from a sample of immigrants in Toronto who were not working in ethnic business, our study confirms that a higher level of blurred boundary experienced by immigrants is associated with a higher income.  The effect is significant even when controlling for the education level and socio-demographic background of immigrants.
0	The recently established tenets of resiliency theory indicate clear distinctions between students of color who have the propensity -- and do -- excel academically and those who do not. Furthermore, the theory presumes resilient youth tend to acculturate. However, recent studies of college-bound students of color focusing on African Americans and Latinos indicate there are distinct instances of resiliency between student populations and within cultural or ethnic groups. The findings suggest that the ways in which resilient students choose to manage hardships are far more divergent and complex than previously assumed.
1	This research examines inter-regional migration patterns in the United States by native-born whites and blacks over the final four decades of the 20(th) century. Our primary research question is whether regional changes in the United States have made the South a more favorable destination than it once was, especially for blacks. Using samples of census data from 1970 to 2000, we analyze white/black differences in primary (an original move) and return migration to the South, as well as in the selectivity of migration. We observe increasing rates of black (compared to white) migration to the South. Additionally, patterns of selectivity within this growing black migration stream suggest that younger, more educated black women are an important component of this regional population shift.

0	This paper examines gender differences in the participation of university life science faculty in the opportunities afforded by the emergence of commercial science. Our particular focus is on the scientific advisory boards (SABs) of biotechnology firms. In part based on interviews of faculty members, we develop hypotheses regarding how scientists career achievementstheir productivity, co-authorship networks, institutional affiliation and patenting activityhave different effects on the likelihood that male and female faculty will become SAB members. We then statistically examine this framework in a case cohort dataset containing the career histories of 6,000 life scientists. We find that participation in for-profit ventures appears to be a new arena in which gender differences in attainment are extensive: women life scientists are far less likely to receive paid advisory roles at for-profit biotechnology companies. Moreover, the gap in participation rates persists after conditioning on numerous measures of human and social capital. We also find that this gender difference is contoured by a number of factors; notably university prestige, co-authorship networks and the level of institutional support for commercial science. Collectively, the qualitative and quantitative findings of this paper establish a large gender gap in the participation of university faculty members in commercial science. They suggest that female faculty are constrained largely by lack of opportunity and, surprisingly, that the gender gap is largest in high prestige institutions.
1	Many studies on family solidarity emphasize the importance of norms for understanding why people help family members. The question of where kinship norms come from, however, is underanalyzed. This study examines the influence of the family of origin oil the development of kinship norms using models of sibling resemblance estimated on a large-scale multi-actor survey. Analyses show that a quarter of the variance in filial norms can be explained by the family of origin. The family of origin has a smaller influence on normative obligations toward children and other family. Part of the total family influence can be explained by the filial norms that parents have themselves and the emphasis parents put oil obedience. Family background characteristics are less important. 
0	No process theory of organizational legitimation yet exists at the organizational level. In this paper I build one which addresses the what, who, and how of organizational legitimation. I propose that legitimation is the cognitive comprehension of an organization by one of three kinds of key audiences: communities of practice, critics, or gatekeepers. Organizations seeking legitimation almost always formally apply for it from gatekeepers. When legitimation is unproblematic, an audience uses its classification rules to put the organization into an existing category in its classification system, but in instances where legitimation is problematic or contested, legitimation consists of active negotiations between the audience and the applicant over how to apply or interpret the rules of classification.
0	Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, research in the field of Western terrorism has mainly focused on attacks executed by Al Qaeda but has not yet attempted to compare Al Qaeda to other terrorist groups executing transnational terrorist attacks in Western Europe and North America. Further, it has not yet investigated what causes those groups to execute transnational terrorist attacks. To investigate these research gaps, two systematic databases were compiled. It was found that there are two major terrorist groups besides Al Qaeda, namely the Algerian and Kurdish terrorists. This study found significant differences between Al Qaeda and these groups. Al Qaeda executes more attacks than the Algerian terrorists and far less than the Kurdish ones. Its attacks are much deadlier than the Kurdish and Algerian terrorist attacks. Al Qaeda uses a much broader range of incident types and is the only group that carries out suicide attacks. This study concludes that although foreign policy predicts the prevalence of terrorist attacks to an extent, the better predictor of prevalence is the sub-population size related to the terrorist group.
1	Using the Interpersonal Exchange Model of Sexual Satisfaction, we consider how infidelity, pornography consumption, marital satisfaction, sexual frequency, premarital sex, and cohabitation are associated with married couples' sexual satisfaction. Data from 433 couples are analyzed with structural equation models to determine the contributions of (a) each respondent's predictors (actor effects) and (b) his/her spouse's predictors (partner effects). No gender differences in actor and partner effects emerge. Marital satisfaction and sexual frequency act as rewards and increase sexual satisfaction. A partner effect emerges for marital infidelity, suggesting that a spouse's infidelity is costly for sexual satisfaction. Finally, some evidence suggests that pornography consumption is costly for own and spouse's sexual satisfaction, especially when pornography is used by only one spouse.

The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA]. it has been clear that these preference differences alone, even if mild, can lead to complete separation of racial groups. Recently published work by [Fossett, Mark. 2006. Ethnic preferences, social distance dynamics. and residential segregation: theoretical explorations using simulation analysis. journal of Mathematical Sociology 30, 185-274] adds even greater certainty to the proposition. We explore this process empirically through a case study of a university housing system that recently experienced an increase in the residential separation between black and white students. Unlike residential segregation in the larger community, separation on the college campus does not have deep roots in institutionalized mechanisms of discrimination. In fact, residence assignment procedures are completely ""color-blind."" Thus a college campus is an (almost) ideal place to study the role of preferences in residential segregation. We use data on the ranks continuing students give to residence halls in response to their housing applications and we relate the ranks different types of student give to halls of different racial composition. Not surprisingly, we find that percent black is associated with a higher, more preferred, rank for black students, but, surprisingly, we find such an integrationist preference is common among white students as well. However, the effect is much stronger for black than for white students and this difference has important consequences for the residential separation process. "

This revolution generated ample agrarian surplus, in the form of rural elite elevated income, to fuel a capitalist-industrial takeoff in late-eighteenth-century England. The nontransition to capitalism in eighteenth-and nineteenth-century China, despite the vast surplus generated in its advanced agrarian sector shows that high agricultural productivity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a capitalist takeoff. By comparing Qing China with eighteenth-century England, where capitalist industrialization erupted spontaneously, and nineteenth-century Japan, where capitalist industrialization succeeded under intensive state sponsorship, this article argues that a strong urban entrepreneurial elite, capable of centralizing the agrarian surplus and investing it in productive industrial innovation, were as important as the existence of the surplus itself in fomenting capitalist transition. The reproduction of the elite in eighteenth-century China was constrained, not by the anticommercial ""oriental despotic"" state as presumed in earlier literature, but by the state paternalist disposition in managing urban class conflict. Capitalist-industrial development in China was further impeded in the nineteenth century, when a nexus of local predatory-military elite emerged in response to millenarian uprisings and wasted most of the agrarian surplus in their accumulation of means of violence. The negative case of China helps us advance the actor-centric model of capitalist transition by bringing urban entrepreneurs and class politics back in."
1	Sociologists empirically and theoretically neglect genocide. In this article, our critical collective framing perspective begins by focusing on state origins of race-based ideology in the mobilization and dehumanization leading to genocide. We elaborate this transformative dynamic by identifying racially driven macro-micro-macro-level processes that are theoretically underdeveloped and contested in many settings. We investigate generic processes by exploiting an unprecedented survey of refugees from the ongoing genocide in Darfur Our focus is on the Sudanese government crisis framing of a dehumanizing collective process. Sudanese forces joined with Janjaweed militia to attack black African settlements. They aggregated and concentrated racial epithets in a collective process of dehumanization anti organized terror which amplified the severity of genocidal victimization, the lethal and lasting scar of the genocidal state. Our findings question primordial and counter-insurgency explanations, while supporting aspects of the instrumental, population-resource, constructionist, and cognitive perspectives that form the foundation of our critical collective framing perspective. It has been more than 50 years since Sutherland famously added white-collar crime to public sociology, radically reordering discourse about crime. It is time to do the same with Raphael Lemkin concept of genocide.
1	"Over the past 50 years, women roles have changed dramatically-a reality captured by substantial increases in employment and reductions infertility. Yet, the social organization of work and family life has not changed much, leading to pervasive work-family conflict. Observing these strains, some scholars wonder whether US. women high employment levels are sustainable. Women employment in professional and managerial occupations-the core of the analyses offered in this article-merits particular interest because of the material and symbolic implications for gender equality. In a cohort analysis of working-age women born between 1906 and 1975, I show that employment levels among college-educated women in professional and managerial occupations have increased across cohorts. Full-time, year-round employment rates continue to rise across cohorts, even among women in historically male professions and mothers of young children. Although labor force participation rates have stopped rising, they have stalled at a very high rate, with less than 8 percent Of professional women born since 1956 out of the labor force for a year or more during their prime childbearing years. Moreover the difference in employment rates between mothers and childless women-the ""child penalty"" -is shrinking across cohorts."
1	"Suburban maintenance gardening is one service sector that has grown in the United States, and in many parts of the country it has become a gendered occupational niche for Mexican immigrant men. What is the social organization of this occupation and to what extent are Mexican immigrant gardeners following in the footsteps of Japanese gardeners, achieving socioeconomic mobility through gardening? Based on interviews conducted with 47 Mexican immigrant maintenance gardeners in Los Angeles, this article examines the occupational structure of this informal sector job, the social context in which it has developed, the mix of informal and formal economic transactions involved, and the strategic challenges that gardeners negotiate. The data show that there is occupational differentiation and mobility within the gardening occupation, and that mobility in the job remains dependent on combining both ethnic entrepreneurship and subjugated service work. Gendered social and human capital, together with financial and legal capital are necessary for occupational mobility. Jardineria, or suburban maintenance gardening, is analogous to the longstanding labor incorporation of female immigrant domestic workers into affluent households, but it is also indicative of a new trend: the proliferation of hybrid forms of entrepreneurship and service work and the incorporation of masculine ""dirty work"" service jobs into affluent households."
1	A large body of research has established that combat has negative effects on the mental health of soldiers, resulting in PTSD and a wide range of related mental health problems. However, very little research examines what effects non-combat military service may have on the mental health of men. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) we show that men who serve on active duty, and do not see combat, are less likely to experience depressive symptoms than their nonveteran and reserve duty counterparts, although this effect tends to dissipate after discharge from the military. We suggest several mechanisms through which active duty military service may act to reduce the likelihood of developing depressive symptoms. 
1	Our study analyzes how political context, embodied by the welfare state and Leftist political actors, shapes individual poverty. Using the Luxembourg Income Study, we conduct a multi-level analysis of working-aged adult poverty across 18 affluent Western democracies. Our index of welfare generosity has a negative effect on poverty net of individual characteristics and structural context. For each standard deviation increase in welfare generosity, the odds of poverty decline by a factor of 2.3. The odds of poverty in the United States (the least generous welfare state) are greater by a factor of 16.6 than a person with identical characteristics in Denmark (the most generous welfare state). Significant interaction effects suggest that welfare generosity reduces the extent to which low education and the number of children increase poverty. Also, welfare generosity reduces poverty among those with low education, single-mother households and young households. We show that Leftist parties and union density reduce the odds of poverty, however their effects channel through the welfare state. Ultimately, poverty is shaped both by individual characteristics and the political context in which the individual resides.
0	This paper reports on the second study to investigate the factors that lead American consumers to buy from sellers who are members of their social networks.  In line with DiMaggio and Louchs (1998) pioneering analysis, we find that within-network exchange (WNE) is quite prevalent, accounting for at least 44% of the home remodelers selected by respondents to a national survey of homeowners sponsored by the National Association of the Remodeling Industry in 2004.  This survey also provides unique insight into the selection process and generates implications that challenge DiMaggio and Louchs interpretation of WNE as a mechanism by which buyers discipline sellers.  First, it is rare for WNE to involve an explicit choice between a WN remodeler and a non-WN remodeler-- although the within-network remodeler is generally preferred when such a choice is in fact made.  The main reason that such explicit choices are rare is that WNE is associated with a sharp curtailment of the search process.  This seems to reflect the fact that some consumers feel obliged to hire WN sellers, while others tend to satisfice.  Second, since the cost of the project does not increase engagement in WNE and since trustworthiness is not significantly higher for WN remodelers, WNE does not appear to be a uniquely effective instrument of social control.  Rather, what most distinguishes WN remodeler is the sense on the part of the consumer that they are more compatible in a way that fosters an effective working relationship.
0	Through an exploration of trading practices in the London gold market, I argue that that like all other areas of social life, behavior in financial markets can be both instrumental and oriented to subjective social principles.  Even though it underwent various transformations, a genteel ethos governed trading in the London market throughout its history.  Based on trading practices in the 1970s, a decade in which the normative order was relatively stable, I show that traders treated the patrician ethos both as an ends and a means.  Threats of peer sanctions clearly prevented traders from violating the London gold market’s patrician ethos.  Market participants also used the normative order to pursue their own pecuniary self-interest.  Yet these two scenarios do not exhaust the gentlemanly culture’s role.  My research indicates that the actions of the market participants could also be directly oriented toward the subjective social principles of loyalty, duty, and honor.
0	In this study, we employed the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) with more than 40 early career teachers to investigate the social-psychological processes of learning to teach and whether/how these processes varied between different groups of teachers.  That is, we studied whether these processes differed between a) general education and special education teachers, b) elementary and middle school teachers, and c) first-year versus second- or third-year teachers. Specifically, we investigated how time use varies by category of teacher (i.e., during classroom instruction, during school, during waking hours) and what the subjective well-being looks like for our sample of teachers and how emotional responses vary school activities. Findings indicate that teachers experience differ significantly based on their position. Most importantly, there are important time use differences by years of experience. We also found differences in emotional responses for a variety of school activities. Our results indicate that teachers feel most energetic and most skilled when teaching, with the lowest levels of energy present when engaged in paperwork or grading. When interacting with colleagues, the teachers in our sample reported high levels of engagement and positive affect, suggesting that interactions with ones peers play an important role in a teachers daily work. Our findings suggest that the context of teaching has important consequences both for how teachers spend their time, which in turn is likely to produce a variety of emotional responses. For early career teachers, position seems to matter, as do the relationships teachers have with their students and their colleagues.
0	Despite significant anti-tax sentiment in the United States, voters in some public school districts have supported raising taxes dedicated to local education spending. We investigate the strength of three frameworks to explain variations in voter support. From voter behavior research, we draw on utilitarian approaches including the distinction between egocentric utility (voters consider their own individual costs and benefits) and sociotropic utility (voters consider the costs and benefits to society as a whole). From research on public support for government fiscal capacity, we draw on group conflict approaches, which propose that people are less likely to support taxes and spending in more diverse societies. Unlike most prior research in this area, we control for potential selection effects related to voter turnout and districts’ propensity to hold referenda. We find no support for egocentric utility and limited support for sociotropic utility and group conflict.
0	Transsexuality remains grounded in pathologizing discourses.  When transsexuals seek medical transition, they must obtain verification, authorization, and legitimization from attending health providers.  During interactions with health professionals, transsexuals encounter psychomedical gatekeeping, or the systematic process of withholding or conferring services based on a transgender persons compliance with psychotherapeutic, medical, endocrinal, and surgical regimens and credible gender performance.  This study employed grounded theory methods to analyze interviews with 20 female-to-male transsexuals to expose one especially troubling aspect of psychomedical gatekeepinggender profiling.  Gender profiling is the practice of upholding a set of characteristics and behaviors based on conventional or stereotypical understandings of gender and using that limited understanding to assess an individuals ability to successfully pass in society as a woman or man.  This study revealed that, in psychomedical institutions, gender profiling occurs when medical and mental health professionals withhold or confer transition services based on the gender presentations of transgender people.  Ultimately, this dialectical process is managed and maintained by the larger regime of truththe gender binary system.
1	Past research in both the transitions to adulthood literature and cultural sociology more broadly suggests that the working class relies on traditional cultural models in their construction of identity. In the contemporary post-industrial world, however, traditional life pathways are now much less available to working-class men and women. I draw on 93 interviews with black and white working-class young people in their 20s to 30s and ask, in an era of increasing uncertainty, where traditional markers of adulthood have become tenuous, what kinds of cultural models do working-class young people employ to validate their adult identities? In contrast to previous studies of working-class identity, I found that respondents embraced a model of therapeutic selfhood-that is, an inwardly directed self preoccupied with its own psychic development. I demonstrate that the therapeutic narrative allows working-class men and women to redefine competent adulthood in terms of overcoming a painful family past. Respondents required a witness to validate their performances of adulthood, however, and the inability to find one left many lost in transition.
1	"Recent research on African American media representations describes a trend of progressive, antiracist film production. Specifically, ""magical negro"" films (cinema highlighting lower-class, uneducated, and magical black characters who transform disheveled, uncultured, or broken white characters into competent people) have garnered both popular and critical acclaim. I build upon such evidence as a cause for both celebration and alarm. I first examine how notions of historical racism in cinema inform our comprehension of racial representations today. These understandings create an interpretive environment whereby magical black characters are relationally constructed as both positive and progressive. I then advance a production of culture approach that examines 26 films that resonate with mainstream audiences' understanding of race relations and racialized fantasies. I find that these films constitute ""cinethetic racism""-a synthesis of overt manifestations of racial cooperation and egalitarianism with latent expressions of white normativity and anti-black stereotypes. ""Magical negro"" films thus function to marginalize black agency, empower normalized and hegemonic forms of whiteness, and glorify powerful black characters in so long as they are placed in racially subservient positions. The narratives of these films thereby subversively reaffirm the racial status quo and relations of domination by echoing the changing and mystified forms of contemporary racism rather than serving as evidence of racial progress or a decline in the significance of race."
0	The article centers on an examination of discourse formation in international organization settings. International organizations, including the WHO, OIE and FAO, are selectively promoting a discourse of modernization on controlling avian flu epidemic while neglecting the problems that modern farming practices might cause and alternative viewpoints. By examining the official documents and activities made by these organizations, I argue that the discourse of modernization is constructed and reinforced by a pro-natural science institutional environment, organizational routines and rituals, and networks these organizations instigated.
1	Drawing on longitudinal data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999, this study used IRT modeling to operationalize a parental educational investment measure based upon Lareau's notion of 'concerted cultivation.' The analysis used multilevel piecewise growth models regressing children's general knowledge achievement from kindergarten through the first grade on a measure of concerted cultivation and indicators of the family context. The measure of concerted cultivation explained over 30% of the SES gradient and an additional 20-25% of the race/ethnic general know[edge gaps at kindergarten entry after controlling for SES, and was larger than the SES coefficient in magnitude. These findings (a) lend partial support to Lareau's contention that concerted cultivation explains SES learning advantages; (b) contradict the argument that net of SES, concerted cultivation is mostly unrelated to race/ethnic gaps: (c) and raises questions about the importance concerted cultivation for learning disparities after school entry. 
0	Nursing has received a lot of attention as an occupation that requires a high degree of emotion work.  This paper explores the emotional experiences of nurses, their perceptions of emotion management at work as a stressful component of the labor and considers how the emotional aspects of their job influence their family life.  This study draws on focus groups that were conducted as part of a larger multi-methodological investigation of the experiences of nurses in two community hospitals.   I find that nurses experience a wide range of emotion and that their attempts to manage these emotions to bring them in line with expectations are often described as stressful.  Further, some nurses described how stress from work, particularly emotional stress, can spillover into their life outside of work while others emphasized the importance of segmenting work and family.  Implications for the nursing shortage and reducing stress for the retention of nurses are discussed.
1	Social scientists have long suspected that friendship dyads are not always reciprocated and those that are reciprocated are likely to be more intimate. Close friendships may provide youth with an environment conducive to healthy development and educational outcomes. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative dataset of youth, we examine how attributes of respondents and their friends affect the odds of reciprocity between adolescents. Asian Americans and females are the most likely to have reciprocated friendships. Interracial friendships are less likely to be reciprocated than intraracial friendships. Further, adolescents with reciprocated friendships report higher levels of school belonging. Finally, reciprocity and school belonging both exert independent effects on academic performance. Friendship reciprocity is an important indicator of social support above and beyond the numbers of friends reported by youth. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	Marriage patterns differ dramatically in the United States by race and education. The author identifies a novel explanation for these marital divides, namely, the important role of personal wealth in marriage entry. Using event-history models and data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort, the author shows that wealth is an important predictor of first marriage and that differences in asset ownership by race and education help to explain a significant portion of the race and education gaps in first marriage. The article also tests possible explanations for why wealth plays an important role in first marriage entry.
0	Using historical and ethnographic methods, this paper explores how livelihood, recreational, and protective attachments to New York City’s Jamaica Bay combine with forces such as informal residential segregation to create a sense of “place attachment” around the National Park Service’s Gateway National Recreation Area.  The paper examines the physical (e.g., Jamaica Bay ecology) and social factors (e.g., residential segregation, recreational attachments) involved in place attachment as well as how place attachment has changed since the establishment of the Gateway National Recreation Area in 1972.  The paper explores how place attachment can result in feelings of entitlement to nature that precludes neighboring communities’ (of different racial and socio-economic status) use of this National Recreation Area.   Consequently, the paper makes suggestions as to how environmental policy can foster environmental stewardship via place attachment without creating barriers for others’ use of natural spaces.
0	In this paper I draw from two years of ethnographic field work in the emerging rural settlement area of Southwest Montana to analyze the ways in which the context of reception for Latino migrants impacts mothering. I construct my analysis by looking at three primary elements of migrant incorporation: 1) economic opportunity structure, 2) rurality, and 3) transnational socio-cultural context. I find that in Southwest Montana traditional gender relations are typically fortified or reintroduced through the migration and settlement process often to the detriment of Latino women. And yet, paradoxically, Latinas in Montana generally identify as good mothers because they feel they can provide safety and opportunities for their children that they could not provide elsewhere.
1	In this paper we present a comprehensive framework for understanding gender inequality in baccalaureate degree attainment Our 'college pipeline model addresses two main shortcomings in prior research First we examine multiple outcomes and stages in the pipeline that lead to four-year college entry and completion Second we examine multiple different pathways that students can pursue in attaining a four-year degree Our findings indicate that females enjoy a cumulative advantage over males in the pursuit of a baccalaureate degree but with two important exceptions First although females are more likely apply to college at the end of high school they are also more likely to terminate their schooling in a two-year college than comparable males Second females who make an on-time transition into a four-year college experience the greatest advantages over males and females who delay entering the college pipeline actually do no better than males in attaining a bachelor s degree 
1	Bullying has been increasingly identified as a significant social problem. Although much of this attention has centered on the context Of schooling, researchers are now beginning to recognize that workplaces are also arenas rife with abusive, bullying behaviors. Personality attributes of bullies and victims have received attention, but much less research has examined the social and organizational foundations of bullying. In this article, we focus theoretical attention on the importance of status-based power differentials and organizational context for the emergence of supervisory bullying in employment. Our multi-method analyses, which draw from content-coded organizational ethnographies (N=204), highlight the importance not only of structural and social vulnerability-such as being in a racial minority or of a low occupational position-but also of chaotic and disorganized workplaces. Poor workplace organization, we show, creates positive motivations for supervisory bullying. Workplaces without capable guardians create further vulnerabilities to bullying as a managerial control tactic. We conclude by discussing the theoretical implications Of our results for understanding social power, organizational dynamics and the ramifications of abuse in the workplace.
0	In this paper I argue that despite the valid critiques of Job Clubs and other job readiness workshops made by various scholars, these classes may also benefit clients in unforeseen ways that are significant. My findings are based on my observations of four Job Club and Job Search classes at two different sites within one California county. The instructors were the most crucial factor in how far the classes strayed from the negative assumptions with which I entered. There are two characteristics of the classes and welfare bureaucracy that allowed for these positive outcomes. First, there are spaces within the classes for relationships to develop and for clients and instructors to share information and support. Secondly, the ambiguity of many welfare rules allows for significant variation among caseworkers, both in terms of the help they provide clients, and in their interpretation and application of the rules.
0	As we address the challenges in teaching the sociology of race and ethnicity to the Millennial Generation we must ask ourselves an important question:  Are Millennial students racial attitudes and beliefs changing for the better?  Drawing on the preliminary findings of a qualitative study that examined 25 undergraduate students experiences with their interracial contact and racial identity development while growing up, I argue that their racial attitudes are possibly changing in the abstract, but not in practice.  In other words, their world view is overshadowed by the illusion of moral and ethical principles rather than realityi.e., there is a strong belief in what ought to be rather than what is.  In this paper I make a theoretical case for teaching the social construction of race and ethnicity through a micro-macro analytical lens based on the preliminary findings of my qualitative study.
0	Based on two years of observations and engaging in informal conversations with passengers on Greyhound Line buses, this article describes the long-distance bus journey and the ways in which people actively disengage with other passengers. Using the Greyhound buses and stations as a microcosm of other such public spaces, I examine its unspoken rules and behavior. I paint a picture of the buses and stations, the patrons, the employees, and the transactions that take place between them. Using ideas from Goffman’s civil inattention theory, Lofland’s thoughts on strangers, and symbolic interactionism, I explain what I call “nonsocial transient behavior” that takes place on the Greyhound buses and at the bus terminals. The conditions in which nonsocial transient behavior takes place and encourages disengagement are identified as follows: mutual understanding of people’s aggravation, uncertainties about strangers, and physical exhaustion.
0	For over forty years, exchange theories have tried to predict the results of power exercise in exchange structures.  Many theories of exchange have found considerable experimental support, however some scholars argue that the scope of these investigations is too narrow for application in the field. In particular, most exchange network studies are restricted by the assumption that all actors have full-information about structure and interaction outcomes. However, previous research suggests that actors in ‘natural social structures’ do not always have access to such information. It follows that, to understand exchange outcomes in the field, exchange theory must explain how different information conditions affect power exercise. In this paper, we begin to explore the link between power and information. After discussing how power develops in full information structures affected by different structural conditions, we then look at what information is necessary to produce the predicted power development. Next, we examine what actors can infer when full information is not limited and we look at some preliminary data that is consistent with our analysis.
0	Our work focuses on the shift from a highly specialized system of care to one of family medicine utilizing Village Health Committees in Kyrgyzstan. While the benefits of the health care reform have been substantial and many are pleased with the results to date, many are unhappy with results and there have been unintended consequences. Based on interviews with patients in 4 settings in rural and urban Kyrgyzstan over 15 months in 2008-2009 we discover unintended consequences to some components of health care reform. For example, while Village Health Committees allow greater community involvement in health, they can also be used as tools of social control, an important consideration in a context only recently removed from the extreme repression of years of Soviet control and currently in the midst of great political and social upheaval. Our work suggests that while we should acknowledge the good work that has been done in Kyrgyzstan, premature judgments may ignore context specific issues and unintended consequences.
0	A voluminous literature exists regarding school effects on student achievement. Despite the popular assumption that childrens learning environment helps to shape their educational outcomes, relatively little research has specifically addressed this issue. Using a nationally representative sample of high schools and students, this paper examines the relationship between objective measures of school quality and student achievement. Findings suggest that school quality has a small, positive effect on students standardized math scores net of traditional predictors of achievement, including sociodemographic background, educational and occupational aspirations, and school effort. Furthermore, the school quality-achievement relationship becomes statistically insignificant only after including a lagged measure of achievement in the model. The policy implications of these findings are discussed.
0	In this paper, I intend to discuss the relationships between two different ways of conceiving change in penality. On the one hand, I consider a concept derived from the work by Georg Rusche, the idea of connecting movement in penality to long cycle change in socio-economic structures. Such change seems to be effective in orienting the direction of the slope in imprisonment rates (as a measure of punishment) but unable to predict their size. In order to get closer to the reality of punishment, the analyst has to come to terms with the fact that, on the other hand, penal institutions seem to be embedded in cultural and institutional traditions derived from history and that are therefore specific to individual cultures. In particular, I would like to address the connections between changing vocabularies of punishment and the discourses of religion, political economy, international relations and masculinity. My empirical reference is to long-term development of penality (as represented by imprisonment rates) in the US and Italy. I intend to show that, rather than being the product of an assumed socio-structural change, penality seems to encapsulate a way in which dominant cultural trends may at times drive change in social structure.
0	This paper addresses the relationship between the capitalist class and changes in economic policy through a case study of Mexicos shift from a protectionist economic policy to a neoliberal economic policy which opened Mexicos markets to global competitors.  In contrast to most leading interpretations, this study suggests that internationally oriented fractions of Mexicos capitalist class played an important role in convincing Mexicos government to adopt neoliberal reforms.  Moreover, it specifies how Mexicos capitalist class influenced government policy, by mobilizing, forging coalitions with bureaucrats and becoming economically more powerful, thereby illustrating several ways that the capitalist class can influence government policy.
0	Analyzing data from interviews from 18 Indian American couples, I found that multiculturalism in the U.S. involves the willingness to answer constant questions from non-Indians about India and Indian culture. Surprisingly, despite being asked primarily about the same set of cultural markers and experiences, I found that participants in my study did not find this constant questioning offensive. Moreover, participants reported that they enjoyed educating non-Indians about Indian culture. Thus, cultural ambassador is merely a component of friendly U.S. multiculturalism. This paper critiques multiculturalism as cultural hegemony that places Indian Americans as the inherent subject with the expectation that they can speak for all of India and Indian culture. Consequently, the cultural ambassador contributes to a homogenous view of the Indian American community.
1	Experimental estimates from Moving to Opportunity (MTO) show no significant impacts of moves to lower-poverty neighborhoods on adult economic self-sufficiency four to seven years after random assignment. The authors disagree with Clampet-Lundquist and Massey's claim that MTO was a weak intervention and therefore uninformative about neighborhood effects. MTO produced large changes in neighborhood environments that improved adult mental health and many outcomes for young females. Clampet-Lundquist and Massey's claim that MTO experimental estimates are plagued by selection bias is erroneous. Their new nonexperimental estimates are uninformative because they add back the selection problems that MTO's experimental design was intended to overcome.
1	Employing data from the 2002 European Social Survey for 21 national representative samples, we provide the first cross-national analysis of the relations between ethnic composition of neighborhood and perception of neighborhood safety in the European context. The data reveal considerable variation both across countries and across individuals in perceived safety. Bi-level regression analysis shows that perceived safety tends to be lower in countries characterized by a high imprisonment rate and among Europeans who are physically and socially vulnerable (e.g., among women and elderly people, and among populations of low income and low education). Net of individual-level and country-level attributes, the analysis shows that perceived safety is lowest in neighborhoods mostly populated by non-European ethnic minorities and highest in neighborhoods mostly populated by Europeans. The effect of ethnic composition of neighborhood on perceived safety holds even after controlling for previous personal exposure to crime and views toward minorities' impact on crime. We discuss the results in comparison to findings in the United States and in the light of theory in order to delineate the ways that views and perceptions about places are formed and shaped.
0	Smart growth, also known as new urbanism promotes higher density housing, buildings and neighborhoods that share residential and commercial spaces, more parks and open green spaces, pedestrian-friendly alternatives to the automobile, and more recently, social equity through mixed-income neighborhoods. This paper is a preliminary examination of the structural and cultural features of regionally connected communities that both support and oppose smart growth development. Medium sized cities along the southern coastal region of California are chosen for their recognition in the literature for pioneering urban growth management policies. However, the cities in this region vary in their smart growth adoption. That variation is important for this research. This paper assesses the degree of smart growth and/or new urbanism in these cities and compares them, and describes and compares the socio-cultural conditions that seem to favor this approach to land-use. The research in this paper contributes to a larger project on compact housing in clusters of cities in California and Oregon. In this paper, a city’s degree of green urbanism is assessed by examining city planning documents, policies, and recent local political debates over land-use.  This is a preliminary exploration of the data. For the dissertation, “new urbanist” projects will be counted and analyzed with fuzzy set logic. This paper organizes much of the basic raw data on the cities and suggests preliminary hypotheses.
1	"Prior research suggests a correlation between incarceration and marital dissolution, although questions remain as to why this association exists. Is it the stigma associated with ""doing time"" that drives couples apart? Or is it simply the duration of physical separation that leads to divorce? This research utilizes data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) and the Survey of Officer and Enlisted Personnel to shed light on these questions. The findings generally support a separation explanation of the incarceration-divorce relationship. Specifically, the data show that exposure to incarceration has no effect on marital dissolution after duration of incarceration is taken into account. In addition, across both datasets we find that individuals who spend substantial time away from spouses are at higher risk of divorce. The findings point to the importance of spousal separation for understanding the incarceration-marital dissolution relationship. Moreover, and in contrast to settings in which stigma appears quite salient (e.g., labor markets), our results suggest that the shared history and degree of intimacy among married partners may weaken the salience of the stigma of incarceration. Findings are discussed in the context of a burgeoning body of work on the collateral consequences of incarceration and have implications for the growing pool of men in American society returning from prison."
1	Social scientists typically examine social movements as grassroots phenomena, yet public leaders and elite actors also play important roles. This article examines their role in one contemporary social movement, American evangelicalism. Through semistructured interviews with 360 elite informants, as well as archival and ethnographic research, I explore the mechanisms through which leaders have sought to advance evangelicalism between 1976 and 2006. These public leaders founded organizations, formed networks, exercised convening power and drew on formal and informal positions of authority to achieve movement goals. Results suggest that salient religious identity and cohesive networks have played important roles in shaping the goals and ambitions of leaders within the evangelical movement. Structural coincidence provided by governance structures at evangelical organizations, as well as evangelical programs directed toward elite constituents, have facilitated the formation of overlapping networks across social sectors. Institutional inertia and internal factions, however, have been countervailing forces. This empirical study demonstrates the persistence Of institutional differentiation among America leadership cohort, but it also points to a religious identity that can provide vital, cross-domain cohesion within the structure Of elite power.
0	Modern education emerged in the long modern century stretching from the mid-eighteenth century through the early twentieth century. Many accounts of modern education assert that its goals, structure, content and functions were essentially identical across all modern societies. This paper argues, to the contrary, that at least six distinctive patterns of modern education emerged, each reflecting their unique temporal and spatial context and the nature to the ideological, economic, and political changes that accompanied their birth and systematization. These patterns are the Prussian, French, English, American, Japanese, and Russian approaches to modern education. The paper first seeks to describe the process of emergence of these respective systems , and then it reflects on some of the implications for institutional theory.
1	Studies of peer effects in educational settings confront two main problems. The first is the presence of endogenous sorting which confounds the effects of social influence and social selection on individual attainment. The second is how to account for the local network dependencies through which peer effects influence individual behavior. We empirically address these problems using longitudinal data on academic performance, friendship, and advice seeking relations among students in a full-time graduate academic program. We specify stochastic agent-based models that permit estimation of the interdependent contribution of social selection and social influence to individual performance. We report evidence of peer effects. Students tend to assimilate the average performance of their friends and of their advisors. At the same time, students attaining similar levels of academic performance are more likely to develop friendship and advice ties. Together, these results imply that processes of social influence and social selection are sub-components of a more general a co-evolutionary process linking network structure and individual behavior. We discuss possible points of contact between our findings and current research in the economics and sociology of education. 
1	This study uses data from 23 countries in the World Values Survey and the National Survey of Families and Households and finds that the sex gap in feelings of depression is wider in high gender equity societies even though overall levels of feelings of depression are lower. Using hierarchical logistic modeling, we find that the sex difference in feelings of depression is wider in high gender equity societies because children increase depression for women in high gender equity societies, while they reduce depression for women without paid employment in low gender equity societies. There is little difference in the effect of children on feelings of depression for men across societies.

And world polity theory increasingly acknowledges power - that some states and regions are dominant in the international field. But current world polity measures of international nongovernmental organizations do not adequately incorporate either networks or power, leading to a mismatch between theory and measurement. In this article, we draw upon world polity, world system and social networks theories to inform the development Of a new over-time measure Of country-level connectedness to the world polity, which we label the ""INGO Network Country Score."" This measure scores countries by their centrality in the world country-INGO network. We compare our newly-proposed INGO Network Country Score to the traditional measure (country-level raw counts of INGO memberships) and demonstrate striking differences. Our network-based measure shows less inequality among Western countries than the traditional measure, and greater inequality between the West and the rest of the world. Looking over time, we draw three further implications from our new measure. First, there is evidence of inequality in network centrality in the world polity at all time points. Second, regional inequalities persist. Third, connections in the world polity are not exponentially increasing, as previously hypothesized. An added benefit of the analysis is our presentation of the first visual representation of country connections through INGOs."
0	Close friendships may provide youth with a supportive environment in which they can develop, however, not all adolescents report having close friendships. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative data set of youth, I examine patterns of friendlessness among youth. More specifically, I study how individual attributes of respondents, especially race and gender, affect the odds of having best friends. Whites and females are the most likely to have a best friend, and Black males are the most likely to be friendless. Finally, I find evidence that nativity status, age, closeness with parents, and relationships in school are important explanatory measures that shape racial and ethnic differences.
1	This study examines whether the mental and physical health of single mothers benefit from marriage or cohabitation compared to childless women who marry. Results indicate that marrying is associated with similar declines in psychological distress for single mothers and childless women, but only when that marriage endures. Single mothers do not receive the same physical health benefits from entering an enduring marriage, in part because single mothers have lower levels of marital quality. Entering and exiting marriage is worse for the mental and physical health of single mothers than for other women and in some cases, worse than remaining unpartnered. Enduring cohabiting unions offer few psychological or physical health benefits to either group but short-lived cohabiting unions are associated with increased distress.

Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations have increased the scale of overall meat production, transforming previous production practices, social relationships, and environmental conditions.  Much of the growth and change in swine production has occurred in North Carolina, which was the second largest pork producing state in the nation by the end of the twentieth century.  This radical alteration in animal production has generated severe environmental problems, especially given the concentration of waste generated by over ten million hogs. Here we employ both the treadmill of production and metabolic rift perspectives to frame our analysis of the growth and transformation of swine production, as well as the creation of concomitant ecological problems.  From this analysis, we raise critical questions in regards to the structure of animal production, particularly evaluating its social-environmental context.
0	"The New Deals federal works program comprised a third tier of social policies that were institutionally distinct from social insurance and public assistance.  This paper examines the political consequences of these work programs in comparison to the political consequences of social insurance and public assistance.  In addition, the paper draws on Pierre Bourdieus notion of ""classification struggles"" to criticize and improve upon social citizenship and social control theories of the welfare state, which have been linked respectively to the social insurance and public assistance tiers of the U.S. welfare state.  I argue that while the constitution of relief recipients as a clearly demarcated pariah class may facilitate their regulation, attempts by the state to regulate ill-defined subjects encourage political contention over the very constitution of those subjects.  A careful examination of political contention over the Works Progress Administration (WPA) illustrates this thesis and provides historical evidence for it.  First, I show how the WPA positioned its workers in contradictory ways that resembled both public employment and public assistance.  Second, I show how the contradictory location of WPA workers expanded opportunities for them to contest their classification as paupers, not by shunning public aid, but by redefining it as legitimate employment.  Third, I argue that these claims were contentious because of the potential material and symbolic profits that corresponded to the status of employee.  As other New Deal institutions like the National Labor Relations Board granted new rights to workers in private industry, WPA workers demanded similar rights and privileges."
1	We apply Durkheim's social transitional theory to explain the variation of anomie in 30 nations in the world. Combining data from two sources the 1995 World Values Survey and the United Nations University's World Income Inequality Database or WIID - we test the hypothesis that rapid sociopolitical change at the structural level disrupts social integration and regulation, and increases the level of anomie among individuals in a society. Using the multilevel approach that permits the decomposition of variance within and between nations, the results of the analyses confirm that rapid sociopolitical change at the macro level, such as the political transition from totalitarianism to democracy, produces a higher level of anomie among individuals in a society. In addition, we find a cross-level effect of confidence in authority on anomie. Findings at the individual level are largely consistent with Merton's theory of anomie and with the extant literature that anomie is inversely related to an individual's social and economic position in a society.
0	In this paper, I use a life-course approach to examine young adults attitudes toward providing financial support to aging parents and toward letting aging parents live with them.  Using national data, I model the effects of returning to the parents home, as well as the relationship to the parent, on attitudes toward parental support.  I find marginally significant effects of returning to the parents home on attitudes toward support.  Additionally, relationship to the parent has an effect on attitudes toward support that differ by gender.  Daughters who are close to their father are more likely to support attitudes toward providing financial help, and sons who are close to their mother are more likely to support attitudes toward living with an aging parent.
0	While parenthood is a mark of maturity and a major source of meaning for many, socialization for this role is largely understudied. This study aims to add to our knowledge of socialization for parenthood by exploring media as both a socializing agent and as a legitimizer of other socializing agents. Through a content analysis of popular parenting magazines, the author asks: What do popular magazines present as important parenting issues? Who is given standing, or a voice, on these issues? And, what is the relationship between the parenting experts and particular parenting issues?
0	This paper examines generation effects and migrations effects on Koreans collective memory of Korean history in the last century.  Two hundred sixteen subjects from South Korea and the U.S. were asked to identify three important events in Korean history, and to provide reasons for their selections.  This study contributes to the literature in the sociology of collective memory by examining a non-western, culturally homogeneous population in a homeland, and comparing them with their emigrant counterparts.  This study confirms the generation effect identified in previous collective memory studies, and the discussion highlights the differences in reasons for selecting events as reflective of respondents direct or indirect experience of historical events.  The study explores the emigration effect on collective memories, and offers suggestions for how future studies might account for the effect of migration patterns on collective memory.
1	We outline a new explanation of discrimination against numerical minorities. In contrast to prior work that focuses on how the content of categories affects discrimination, our argument describes how the size of categories leads to discrimination. Specifically, we argue that, when comparing multiple categories, actors tend to view larger categories as more closely approximating an underlying population than smaller ones. As a result, a decision maker will tend to expect that members of a numerical majority are more likely to be what he/she is searching for, whether it is the best or worst candidate. We report the results of two studies designed to test these arguments. To demonstrate the generality of the proposed mechanism, Study 1 tested the argument in a non-social domain. Participants disproportionately favored the majority (vs. minority) category when searching for a single winning lottery ticket, and favored the minority category when the goal was to avoid a single losing ticket. Our second study supported an additional implication of the argument in a social domain: decision makers tended to rank highly qualified majority job candidates as better than equally qualified minority candidates, and relatively unqualified majority candidates as worse than equally unqualified minority candidates. 
1	Why did some Americans volunteer to provide relief to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack victims, their families, or workers? This paper uses data from the 2002 Religion and Public Activism Survey, a nationally representative sample of adult Americans, which show that 10 percent of Americans volunteered to help victims of the terrorist attacks in some way to address this question. We argue that the act of volunteering in response to September 11 depended on levels of identification with victims of the tragedy. One of the strongest factors was personal identification with victims, which was built through personal networks such as knowing someone who was killed or in danger during the attacks, and through personal feelings of responsibility to help others in need. Identification was also constructed through involvement in social events such as community candlelight vigils that reflected on, framed, and reinforced the significance of the disaster in a communal setting. In addition, identification with victims was built through a patriotic response to the tragedy, which, we argue, motivated Americans to defend the society with which they were emotionally identified and to see victims as part of the American family to which they were obligated to help in times of need. We argue that emotions matter for disaster relief, but that sorrow rather than anger is important for generating identification with victims and thus volunteering for 9/11 relief efforts. These arguments are used to explain gender and political party differences in 9/11 volunteering. Finally, embeddedness in religious congregations promoted volunteering for 9/11 relief efforts.

Forty students at different stages of the program were interviewed during the first half of the study. Students displayed large variations in their levels of previous exposure to specific kinds of social and cultural capital that according to the literature are associated with success in scientific careers. Exposure to these types of capital through the intervention program had a positive impact on all students, particularly on those entering the program with little or no previous exposure. Students acquired the skills to develop professional relations with senior researchers in their fields of interest and had opportunities to create these relationships. Preliminary analysis of the data indicates that students embodied these kinds of capital and were activating them in order to further their careers. It is still too early to ascertain whether these program benefits will have a long term impact on their career paths. Findings point to the need for interventions for underrepresented groups to include exposure to social and cultural capital as well as their traditional academic components. Theoretical implications include the need for researchers to examine whether students can acquire social and cultural capital outside of the home environment.
0	In this paper, we analyze and discuss the results of a comparative study of experiences of and responses to exclusion and stigmatization by marginalized groups in two countries: the US and Israel. Our analysis is based on in-depth interviews with African Americans in the U.S. and three marginalized groups in Israel: Ethiopian Israelis; ‘Mizrachim’ (Jews from Arab countries); and Arab citizens of Israel. Interview subjects in both sites were asked a similar set of questions about their experiences with exclusion and stigmatization, how they understood those experiences and how they reacted to them. This comparison emphasizes two interrelated innovations in the study of race and racism. First, rather than trying to gauge the top-down extent and impact of racism and its implications for inequality, our focus here is on how individuals subjectively experience and interpret exclusion and stigmatization and how they respond to it, both in concrete cases and in general terms. Second, because it is a cross-national comparison, we show how the subjective experience of exclusion and stigmatization varies across national contexts and is interpenetrated by distinct but overlapping sets of nationally specific cultural repertoires. Furthermore, we examine the extent to which there are differences across class lines in the way that respondents experience and respond to racism.
1	"During the 1980s and 1990s, industrial restructuring led to a marked increase in wage inequality. Women, however, were nor as negatively affected by declining, manufacturing employment because their pay was relatively low within the industry, and their already high representation in the service sector provided access to newly created opportunities. However, black and white women did not fare equally and the black-white wage gap more than doubled. As both black and white women increased their representation as professionals and managers, black women became more likely to earn low wages within these occupations. Black degree holders also lost ground as they were unable to keep pace with the remarkable gains made by white women degree holders. The growth in black-white wage inequality, then, was not due to black women's relegation to ""bad jobs."" Instead, as women increased their share of ""good jobs,"" white women disproportionately benefitted."

1	"The late 2000s Great Recession brought rising neighborhood poverty in the midst of affluence, and the reemer-gence of a racial and ethnic ""underclass"" living in inner-city neighborhoods. Our approach redirects attention to a level of geography-cities, suburbs, and small rural towns-where local political and economic decisions effectively exclude the poor and minority populations. It uses newly released poverty data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey to provide evidence of changing macro patterns of spatially concentrated poverty. We show that roughly one in four U.S. places had poverty rates exceeding 20 percent in 2005 through 2009, up 31 percent since 2000. Roughly 30 percent of America's poor reside in poor places, and concentrated poverty is especially high among poor African Americans. Overall increases in place-based poverty nonetheless were muted over the decade by declines in concentrated poverty among poor Hispanics (a pattern that reflects spatial diffusion to new destinations). We also show that America's poor were sorted unevenly from place-to-place within local labor markets (i.e., counties); poornonpoor segregation rates between places increased from 12.6 to 18.4 between 1990 and the 2005-2009 period. Segregation was especially high among disadvantaged blacks and Hispanics. Our empirical results make a case for more scholarly attention on newly emerging patterns of concentrated poverty at the place level."
1	This article analyzes how the family and the welfare state influence household income trajectories after job loss in the United States and in western Germany. Drawing on panel data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), I study the income buffering effects of the family and the welfare state in the short an in the long run after job loss. I demonstrate that household income trajectories after job loss in the two countries are similar for couple households. However, men in the United States rely relatively more on family resources to overcome income loss, whereas German men's incomes are secured mostly by the welfare state. Women's unemployment in both countries is mainly buffered by their partners' higher earnings. Because single households have no access to family support, they face much higher losses in the United States than in Germany. I also show that the more generous German welfare state triggers less private self-help in the form of increased labor force participation on the part of women when their partners lose their jobs. Over time, the family has become more important in buffering incomes after job loss in the United States which smoothed men's and roughened women's income trajectories in couple households. In Germany, worsening re-employment chances increased income losses in the long run after job loss. 
0	Numerous scholars have argued that we are currently in a post “tattoo renaissance” era wherein the practice has increasingly become a legitimate art form accepted by the American middle class.  In order to facilitate this cultural transition, tattooed people legitimize their own tattoos through various narratives that ascribe deep semantic meaning to their images and words.  Pulling from twenty-two in-depth interviews with tattoo removal clinicians, tattoo artists, people who regret at least one of their current tattoos, and people who have had their tattoos removed or altered, this paper contributes to the literature on the meaning and significance of tattoos in the lives of 21st century Americans.  In particular, we aim to showcase that, in the current cultural context, wherein people feel a need to justify their tattoos with a level of profound symbolic meaning, tattoo regret abounds in a form distinct from that which previous generations of tattooed people experienced.  This paper will discuss the pervasive normative expectation of tattoo narratives and explore how people face potential dilemmas when they lack them, as well as when they subscribe static and absolute meanings to the words and images depicted in their body art.  These narratives, and accordingly the tattoos themselves, become problematic for tattooed individuals as a result of the inability of tattoos to function beyond their capacity as symbolic representations.  When people cannot reconcile or transcend the dynamic and relative nature of their tattoos’ symbolic meanings, they feel regretful and sometimes opt for tattoo cover-ups or removals.
1	"This essay uses a deviant case analysis of the 1995-2000 Detroit newspaper strike to critique and revise theories of strike activity. As the formal institutions regulating industrial relations in the United States have declined, workplace struggles have expanded or reentered into other arenas of the state and civil society. In addition, the essay develops the methodological concept of a ""signal juncture,"" that is, moments of conflict that reveal a ""collision"" of underlying developmental paths. Unlike the more familiar concept of the critical juncture, a signal juncture reveals ongoing structural tensions and conflicting actors within otherwise continuous trends."
0	In the wake of Rawls recent reconsideration of Durkheims Elementary Forms (2005), particularly her exhumation of the dualistic model of human nature at its core, the present paper examines his assertions for homo duplex in light of the relevant empirical evidence. It finds that his characterization of human nature as divided between conflicting animal(egoistic, amoral, non-reasoning) and human (social, moral, reasoning) aspects is largely correct. However, Durkheim is mistaken in primarily associating sociality and morality with the human aspect. Research suggests that human duality consists of a controlled -processing mode in which thought is conceptual and action intentional, and an automatic-processing mode which is much older and operates largely outside of consciousness. In contrast to Durkheims model, this mode contains both homeostatic motivations and the foundations of human sociality and morality. Nevertheless, Durkheims larger point remains true: Religious belief is born of the conflict between these two parallel modes of processing, as individuals behave and perceive under the influence of social  influences that are transparent to their conscious awareness, and are compelled to reconcile the two modes via the construction of the sacred and deities. In short, religion is an expected and predictable by-product of human dualism.
1	Going to college has long been assumed to liberalize students' religious beliefs. Using longitudinal data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, we compare change in the content of religious beliefs of those who do and do not attend college. We find that, in general, college students are no more likely to develop liberal religious beliefs than non-students. In some cases, collegians actually appear more likely to retain their initial beliefs. Change in religious beliefs appears instead to be more strongly associated with network effects. These findings indicate that college's effect on students' religious beliefs is both weak and fragmented, and suggest that the multiplicity of social worlds on college campuses may help to sustain religious beliefs as well as religious practice and commitment.
0	Is marriage still a viable pathway into the middle class in the United States? Simple economics indicate that it still should be the case. The recent decline in marriage rates and increase in middle class attainment; however, suggest a more nuanced relationship between the variables. A relationship where declines in marriage may dampen middle class attainment rates and/or increasing middle class attainment may enable alternative household structures. Race further complicates this picture. The marriage rates of Blacks and Latinos inhibit these groups from realizing the middle-class attainment rates of their white counterparts. Our aim is to examine how racial differences in middle class attainment are related to the distribution of household structures over the past three decades in the U.S. Using 1980-2000 U.S. Census data from IPUMS and the 2008 American Community Survey (ACS), we standardize and decompose the middle class attainment rates of Asians, blacks, Latinos and whites both within and across the respective years. Results indicate that household structure plays a pivotal role in dampening the middle class attainment rates especially for blacks and whites, and changes in the household structure distribution adversely affected blacks the most. Additionally, improving the middle class attainment rates of blacks and Latinos in all household structures would markedly reduce the racial gap in middle class attainment. We conclude with policy implications.
0	Disclosure of ones HIV status to a potential sexual partner has important HIV prevention implications. This paper qualitatively evaluates the social and sexual contexts that influence disclosure of HIV status among methamphetamine-dependent gay men enrolled in an outpatient drug treatment research program. As part of an open-ended, semi-structured interview, 34 HIV-positive and HIV-negative men discussed how, when, to whom, and under what circumstances they reveal information about their HIV status. The four factors that influence participants decision to disclose include: (1) an HIV-negative sexual partners disclosure; (2) sexual venue (private versus public); (3) primary versus non-primary partner; and (4) the perceived risk of the sexual act. Sexual encounters among the men in this sample often occurred in public environments with non-primary partners, and involved use of illicit substances. In these social and sexual contexts, both HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants believed that it is HIV-negative rather than HIV-positive men who should initiate safer sex dialogue and safer sex practices. Findings are helpful in crafting HIV-prevention interventions targeting substance-using gay men whose sexual practices place them at high-risk for HIV-infection.
1	This article examines the prevalence, predictors and outcomes of unmarried mothers' repartnering patterns following a nonmarital birth. Results indicate that, within five years after a birth, approximately two-thirds of unmarried mothers end their relationship with the focal child's biological father, and more than half of these mothers enter new partnerships. Among those who repartnered, 60 percent of mothers formed unions with men who had higher economic capabilities than their former partners, 20 percent formed unions with men of similar capabilities, and 20 percent formed unions with men who had lower capabilities. This pattern holds for both nonresidential and coresidential unions. Our findings are consistent with marriage market, learning and evolutionary biology theories about union formation, and they provide support for qualitative evidence that unmarried mothers have high standards for new partners. While many mothers find new partners who seem to offer a higher level of economic security, many other mothers remain unpartnered, likely due (at least in part) to the limited pool of potential partners with relatively high levels of economic promise.
0	This paper is an institutional examination of the Rhode Island Traffic Stops Statistics Act, a statewide racial profiling bill that was enacted in 2000 by the Rhode Island General Assembly.  Specifically, I trace the steps taken by leaders of the political organizations and bureaucracies that were involved in securing passage of this bill.  I discuss the methods used by the various bureaucracies, among them the Rhode Island General Assembly, Department of the Rhode Island Attorney General, the Rhode Island State Police, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Providence Police Department, City of Providence, The Urban League of Rhode Island, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  As the people working in bureaucracies carry out their activities and practices, the missions of these notable institutions quite likely encompass divergent attitudes, practices, beliefs, and agendas, which may cause them to clash with one another.  Institutions carry out the law and convert it from theoretical abstraction to tangible practice; thus, I intend to explain how the conflictual institutional process shaped the Traffic Stops Statistics Act.  Using this institutional approach, I demonstrate that each institution I examine in this study clearly expressed its distinct perspective along with its particular agenda regarding formulation of the legislation.  An institutional analysis allows me to explore definitively how these institutions shaped the policy formation and implementation process because of their differences in outlook.  Such an analysis permits me to ascertain how political organizations operate within an institutional framework.
1	An operational definition of Guanxi behavior (a type of Chinese social networking) was developed, and several personality and social psychological variables were tested for their relationship with the Guanxi behaviors (in relation to family, friends, and doing favors) developed from the definition. Correlations computed from self reports of 382 Chinese citizens affirmed the expected relationships, and regressions revealed Family Emotional Support, Gregariousness, Chinese Values, and Face to be positively and significantly related to, and explained 41-55% of the variance for, the Guanxi social-networking behaviors. In addition, the Guanxi behaviors explained significant variance for Coworker Support, Life Satisfaction, and Attribution-to-Self for success in life. Concepts are discussed in relation to Chinese culture, as well as attachment and needs theories.

Specifically, I look at how this church uses the slogan of tough faith to appeal to working-class values and the masculine identity perceived to be held by worshippers.  The narrative of tough faith communicates that one needs to endure hardship in order to be saved and to become a trusted member of the church.  I also examine the paradoxical nature of tough faith ideology, as worshippers are encouraged to let go of their sinful pasts while being constantly reminded of their previous wrongdoings.  This paper is based on three months of ethnographic observation and two in-depth interviews with worshippers at the church which is located in an urban neighborhood in Tampa, Florida.
0	The following paper will discuss the performance of heterosexual masculinity in amateur, professional wrestlers. This analysis, unlike existing research on professional wrestling,  focuses on the social environment of the practice space where the farm league wrestlers train, commune, and work. I present findings about the performance of wrestlers masculinity while they are in their backstage practice spaces. Drawing on my fieldwork experience and theories of symbolic interaction and gender, I have analyzed the wrestlers practice space. I argue that the social context of this backstage space shapes the interactions and performances differently than the performances in the frontstage public events. Due to the lack of spectators, the homosocial setting, and the motives of training and communing (versus business and entertaining) the backstage space shapes interactions that require the wrestlers to pay very close attention to the performance of normative heterosexual masculinity.
1	This experiment recreates several features of the selection of candidates for junior professional positions. The situation of central interest involves an assessor (either male or female) and a pair consisting of a male and a female applicant with either equivalent or slightly different academic records. We also investigate effects from quality of record (either excellent or poor) and type of decision (namely, choice between applicants, and ratings of competence and suitability). Our hypotheses consider both gender as social status and as social identity, and predict different outcomes depending on decision type. In line with those predictions, findings show that, at both levels of performance, the question about competence elicited effects only from the two applicants' relative academic standing, while the choice and suitability measures show effects from that standing as well as from sex category of applicant and of assessor. Results and their interpretation are presented and discussed in detail. 
1	Theorists agree that the risk of folding changes as organizations age, but there is little consensus as to the general form or generative processes of age-dependent mortality. This article investigates four such processes (maturation, senescence, legitimation and obsolescence), which have been taken as competing accounts. Using two analytical levers-elaborating on the time shapes of these processes and distinguishing aging of organizations from aging of their templates (designs)-this paper differentiates these four processes and tests them jointly. Analysis of mortality rates for American communes from 1609 through 1965 strongly supports the proposed effects of maturation and senescence at the organization level and legitimation at the level of organizational templates. Results give weaker evidence that obsolescence of templates influenced mortality and that environmental drift exacerbated obsolescence.
0	This study explores the role of reciprocity of social support exchanging behavior in mortality risk caused by cardiovascular disease. Although large amount of researches on social support provided evidences which support the positive effects of social support on health, there were studies that argue excessive support harmful for health. This contradiction implies that the effects of social support are not only depended on the absolute amount of support, but also relied on the balance between providing and receiving support. Thus, this study test the independent effects of the reciprocity of social support on mortality risk after controlling absolute amount of social support. The main result of this study is that the females with a well balanced social support exchanging are more likely to enjoy longer life than others who unilaterally receive or provide social support. Unlike in female case, the reciprocity and absolute amount of social support fail to predict the mortality risk for male. It might be derived from the difference norm of social support between male and female.

He argued that national political cultures are in transition from a set of ""Materialist"" values focused on tradition and survival to ""Post-Materialist"" values of self-expression and quality-of-life improvements (Inglehart 1971, Inglehart and Baker 2000).  Forty years later, this theory still dominates discussion in the field of political culture (Wong 2009, Dalton 2008, Moors 2007, Haller 2002, Warwick 1998, Jackman and Miller 1996, Hahn 1991).  This paper will focus on the method of analysis.  Using a network perspective and methods from cultural anthropology, I show that Inglehart's two factor model contains an unverified assumption about the relationships between values.  By testing this assumption, I show that Inglehart's assumed structure is both empirically inaccurate and a worse approximation than many other alternatives."
1	Previous research has suggested that prisons can both reduce and increase crime. These counterbalancing effects will have different timings. Prison reduces crime by denying those currently behind bars the opportunity to commit further offenses. However, the prison experience and the stigma of an incarceration record can be criminogenic. Once released, ex-inmates might commit more crimes than they otherwise would have. Additionally, an influx of former inmates can cause social disorganization in the community at large. Unlike incapacitation, these crime-promoting effects are not limited to the present, but are based on the proportion of the population that has experienced incarceration either in the current year or in any past year. While some previous studies have recognized the counterbalancing effects, they have only considered the contemporaneous impacts. We develop a statistical model that captures the contemporaneous and lagged effects of incarceration and reentry on property and violent crime rates. State-level panel data results (1978-2003) suggest that, with the inclusion of just 5 years of lags for incarceration and prisoner societal reentry rates, any crime-reducing benefits of increased incarceration are completely eliminated by the crime-promoting effects associated with the increasing prevalence of ex-prisoners. This conclusion is robust to several alternative specifications, including one that accounts for potential reverse causality between the crime and incarceration rates. 
0	While previous work has demonstrated the importance of cognitive ability for whether late-midlife adults use the Internet at all, this study considers whether cognitive ability also differentiates basic aspects of use.  As the Internet comes increasingly to be used to provide tools for navigating complex programs for the elderly like the Medicare prescription drug benefit, implications for the potential exacerbation of cognition-associated inequalities depend not just on who has the Internet but who can use it effectively.  Four measures of effective use are considered: having highspeed access, the length of time since initial household adoption, self-reported time using the Internet each week, and whether any of the respondents Internet use involves the Web.  In all cases, we find associations with cognitive ability, although effects are sometimes mediated to nonsignificance by the addition of subsequent attainments, especially education.   Given the centrality of Internet social support to discussions of older adults navigating the Internet, we look also at self-report measures of the availability of such support, and we find that cognition is positively related to respondents having someone able to help them with Internet problems.  Taken together, our results suggest strongly that the already cognitively advantaged are much better positioned to reap the potential benefits of online tools to help older adults make cognitively complicated decisions.
1	Migrant remittances from the United States to Mexico have grown at an impressive rate in recent years. Using a decomposition technique, I attribute the growth in remittances,for the 1990-2004 period and subperiods within it, to a migration effect, a remitting propensity effect and an average amount effect. Results show that while migration growth was the main force driving remittance growth for most of the 1990s, in the new century remittance growth cannot be simply attributed to migration growth. Mexican migrants are becoming more likely to remit and are remitting larger amounts. This reflects both a change in the composition of the Mexican population in the United States and new modes of immigrant incorporation, consistent with the assimilation and the transnational narratives. Macroeconomic oscillations play an important role in explaining remittance growth as well.
1	"I designed an experiment to test predictions, derived from expectation states theories, that the unequal allocation Of social rewards among collective task-focused actors will affect the actors' rates of power and prestige behavior. Past research shows that allocations Of exchangeable resources can have these effects. The prediction, however, is general and applies to groups where distributed rewards possess only status value. Consistent with predictions, participants who received a fictitious title and a special certificate inviting them to attend an ""exclusive private reception"" as an honored guest resisted influence more and evaluated themselves as more capable compared to participants whose partners received the title, certificate and invitation. I discuss implications of this research for status construction theories, which invoke the processes I examine to describe how new status characteristics could emerge in a society."

In addition, the universitys role in society is increasingly considered to be one of partnering with industry to fuel technological innovation and regional or national economic development.  These factors have caused concern on the part of a number of individuals and civil society groups that universities may neglect research efforts that do not readily serve industrial interests or result in near-term economic returns.  Using U.S. Department of Agriculture Data on notices of field research on transgenic crops, we find that the research profile of universities differs from private sector firms in a number of ways.  University research profiles are less dominated by a focus on major commercial transgenic traits and agronomic crops. And universities are more likely to focus on minor, less commercially relevant, transgenic traits.
1	Using unique data on employers pre-hire preferences, this article examines the effect of sex typing on the gender gap in offered wages and training. Previous studies using post-hire data have not been able to focus directly on the effects of employer behavior, distinct from employee preferences. By analyzing gender-designated job requisitions for the entry-level labor market in a Japanese city, this study investigates employers' pre-hire decisions about the wage level and on-the-job training that accompany the sex typing of jobs. Results show that employers' sex typing excludes women in advance from jobs that provide higher wages and longer training.
0	Using a sample of 15,150 adolescents derived from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examined unique additive and various multiplicative influences of level of acculturation, race/ethnicity, family and community on physical illness. Analyses provided evidence for beneficial additive influence of community rurality on adolescent physical health net of influences of other community and family adversities.  Findings suggest that rural Latino youth are at greater health risk than rural Whites and other rural minority groups. Two acculturation proxies, English spoken in home and third generation status, increased negative health risks. Findings suggest acculturated Latino youth are at higher risk of chronic physical illness than youth who remained adherent to their own culture.  Focus group interviews were conducted to explore possible explanations for these influences. Discrimination, limited service accessibility, and disrupted parent-child relationships emerged as potential explanations for the excessive rural health disadvantage and for the detrimental health influence of acculturation for Latino youth. Policy and program implications are discussed.
0	Stereotyping exists between African-Americans and West Indians in college that may affect student social development based on experiences in and outside the classroom.  The conceptualization of voluntary/involuntary minority groupings helps to classify and contextualize the differences between West Indians and African-Americans in college that manifest as racial tensions between the groups.  This research explores the extent to which attitudes and stereotypes of intra-racial prejudice influence social interactions between African-American and West Indian college students.  Using a mixed method approach, African American and West Indian students from a public university in Metropolitan New York are administered a questionnaire, a racial stereotyping survey, followed by mixed-member focus group interviews. Preliminary findings suggest that stereotypes influence social relationships between West Indians and African-Americans.  West Indians have been stereotyped as jack of all trades and master of none, arrogant, thrifty, pushy and clannish.  African-Americans have been stereotyped as welfare dependent, complacent, squanderers, lazy and lack a sense of togetherness (disorganized).  This research identifies some of the dominant group stereotyping that exist among minority-minority relationships as well as perception-based problem areas critical to any individual/collective efforts at coalition building, improving relations and policy implications related to school social development.  Moreover, it contributes to an understanding of the historical, political, educational and social construction of racial categorizations and racial attitudes that influence social relations, in positive or negative ways.
1	Many authors suggest that having children leads to gaps between the number of hours people prefer to work and the hours they actually work. Existing research, however, offers mixed support for that claim. We discuss the roots of this popular but poorly supported hypothesis and offer the first review of research on the topic, paying special attention to the theoretical implications of previous findings. We also offer the first evaluation of the hypothesis using U.S. panel data. We find that one particular change, the transition from no children to one child, heightens the desire for fewer hours among men and women. Most arrivals and departures of children, however, are not closely connected to hour mismatches. In part, this is because some workers (particularly women) manage to change their actual hours to match their preferences, but it is also because children have modest effects on preferred hours (especially among men). In sum, having children brings many challenges, but our analysis indicates that children bear little responsibility for the work hour mismatches so many Americans report.
1	This study investigates the intergenerational transmission of parents' religious views and divorce attitudes, paying particular attention to the effect of parent-child closeness. We use structural equation modeling to examine a national longitudinal data set containing information from 455 married individuals and their adult offspring. We find that parent religiosity influences Young adults' views of divorce via two pathways: by affecting offspring's religiosity and parents' views of divorce. More religious offspring are less tolerant of divorce, but offspring who do not share their parents' religious practices are nonetheless influenced by their parents' religiously-influenced divorce attitudes. While parent religiosity has no effect on parent-child closeness, religious offspring report having been closer to their parents, suggesting that their Current religious practices may affect their perceptions of the parent-child relationship. 
1	We used multilevel covariance structure analysis to study the relationship between birth weight, family context and youth math and reading comprehension growth from approximately ages 5 through 14 within and between families. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child Sample, we examined the relationship between birth weight and subsequent academic achievement growth disparities, distinguishing between birth weight and other contextual social confounders. We found that smaller birth weight is associated with lower math and reading scores at age 5. Additional findings indicated that the home environment has important developmental consequences from early childhood and into adolescence. Overall, the pattern of findings painted a complex picture of disadvantage, beginning in the womb and extending through a variety of mechanisms into adolescence.
1	Research has shown that blacks are relatively disadvantaged when compared with whites on a host of sociological indicators including on income, education and occupational status. Recent research has shown blacks are not all equally disadvantaged. In some cases such as in the case of blacks in Queens County, New York, blacks surpass whites in terms of median income, especially foreign-born blacks. Yet, blacks fare worse when compared with whites on indicators of asset ownership. Despite that, some black ethnic groups including those with roots in the Caribbean or from Africa have been shown to have higher rates of home ownership and higher housing values than African-Americans. However, few studies include measures of asset ownership beyond these indicators when assessing the extent to which ethnicity matters for blacks. The present study examines the following research questions: (1) What factors explain variations in the likelihood of ownership and the levels of interest, dividends and rental income owned for blacks? (2) Is ethnicity a significant predictor for black respondents? (3) Does education and occupation matter more for some black ethnic groups than for others? The findings reveal that ethnicity plays a significant role in the acquisition and accumulation of interest, dividends and rental income, but it does not account for all of the variations observed for blacks. The findings shed further light on the complexities associated with understanding wealth inequality and racial and ethnic group variations. 
0	This paper briefly describes a longitudinal qualitative interview study of children of incarcerated parents and their caregivers. The paper first reviews the emerging quantitative research literature on children of incarcerated parents, noting that it provides good evidence that children are harmed by parental incarceration across a range of indicators (including aggression, mental health, and educational attainment). It then uses qualitative interviews to explore the ways in which incarceration harms children, focusing on socioeconomic consequences and aggression. Finally, the paper concludes with a caution for policy makers, arguing that demonstrating that parental incarceration harms the average child does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that all children would benefit from the continued presence of the incarcerated parent in their lives.
0	Objective: determine if household remittance expenditure on health is associated with inadequate health insurance coverage and, if so, whether remittance expenditure on health care translates into improved current health status.  Materials and Methods:  Data come from a 2006 survey of 2044 households from two localities in the municipal city of Tepoztlán, Morelos, México.  Logistic regression models are used to test, first, the association between household remittance expenditure and insurance status and, second, the association between remittance expenditure and current health status.   Results: Individuals residing in households that reported spending remittances on health care are significantly more likely to have inadequate insurance coverage (either Popular Health Insurance  (Seguro Popular) or no insurance coverage).  There are no significant differences in current health status by remittance expenditure on health care.  Conclusion: The results suggest that one of the uses of remittances sent from the U.S. is to gain access to health care for individuals who do not have adequate access within the existing Mexican health care system.
1	Labor economic literature has demonstrated a consistent positive association between immigrants' earnings and their level of proficiency in the host society's language. Sociological literature, on the other hand, has explicated that immigrants' abilities to speak the host society's language are affected by structural/ecological factors which shape the linguistic environment of immigrants. This study proposes a logical extension of the two literatures by suggesting that structural /ecological factors affect immigrants' earnings indirectly by affecting their ability to speak the host society's language. Using individual and aggregate data from the U.S. Census 2000, we found that structural/ecological factors such as group size, segregation, and linguistic heterogeneity affected immigrants' earnings not only directly but also indirectly via their impacts on immigrants' English ability. English ability is a key mediator through which structural forces shape individual immigrant's economic assimilation outcome. Published by Elsevier Inc.
0	In this paper, I discuss the theoretical seduction of the individual by culture itself.  The argument I make throughout is that the postmodern individual gives meaning to her life, and thereby creates a pseudo-identity (ontology), albeit malleable and unfixed, through the act of consumption.  In a postmodern culture, and according to Baudrillard, what is being consumed are images and culturally available representations (fashion, media images, etc.).  Individuals attempt to encircle meaning around these representations, yet fail because these images are a part of a much larger system of reversible signification and ever-changing cultural illustrations.  In the end, the productions of cultural identities (selves) actually theoretically seduce, according to my reading of Jean Baudrillard, the individual herself.
1	"This study examines how the neighborhood environments experienced over multiple generations of a family influence children's cognitive ability. Building on recent research showing strong continuity in neighborhood environments across generations of family members, the authors argue for a revised perspective on ""neighborhood effects"" that considers the ways in which the neighborhood environment in one generation may have a lingering impact on the next generation. To analyze multigenerational effects, the authors use newly developed methods designed to estimate unbiased treatment effects when treatments and confounders vary over time. The results confirm a powerful link between neighborhoods and cognitive ability that extends across generations. A family's exposure to neighborhood poverty across two consecutive generations reduces child cognitive ability by more than half a standard deviation. A formal sensitivity analysis suggests that results are robust to unobserved selection bias."
0	The subject of the paper is the cooperative work performed by two operators at an emergency call centre. The aim of this paper is to provide examples of the collaborative, tacit or overt, back-stage work at the medical emergency operations centres that I observed. I shall concentrate on two aspects of this back-stage work: a case in which a female operator, although she was engaged in another activity, demonstrated her awareness of what was happening next to her; a case in which the response was collaboratively constructed (Goodwin 1995) by the two operators. I examine how people sharing a work space, even if they are engaged in different and often independent tasks, show that each of them know what is happening alongside them for all practical purposes, at that moment. The paper also intends to contribute to knowledge about the social processes of technology use. The material analysed consists of video recordings made in an operations centre handling emergency calls to the 118 number in a region of North-Eastern Italy.
0	This paper examines intermediary organizations in order to further develop many of the propositions of new institutional organizational sociology. We build on the argument that organizations occupy distinct field- or sector-level institutional spaces by asking: what does this imply for the coordination of practices across field and sectoral lines? Usually the coordination of intent through network trust, hierarchical command, or economic incentive is the focus of inquiry. However, if the new institutionalists are correct, and practices are often tacit, then coordinating also requires the coordination of practice as well as intent. We argue that a specific organizational form has developed to do just that which we call the intermediary organization. We examine a case study of the emergence of development intermediaries to shed light on this issue and then we make proposals regarding intermediary organizations and what they suggest about the coordination of practical action.
1	Recent increases in births to unmarried parents, and the instability surrounding these relationships, have raised concerns about the possible health effects associated with changes in family structure. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (N = 2,448), this article examines trajectories of maternal mental and physical health. We specifically focus on mothers' transitions into and out of residential relationships with a child biological father during the first five years after birth. We find that continuously married mothers are in better mental and physical health than unmarried mothers one year after birth, but the disparity does not increase over time. This finding provides little support for the resource model. Consistent with the crisis model, exiting a marital or cohabiting union increases mental health problems and decreases self-rated health. These effects appear to be relatively short-lived, though, and they are stronger for mental health than for self-rated health. The results also suggest that union dissolution may be selective of less healthy mothers, whereas union formation does not appear to be selective of healthier mothers.
0	Past studies have shown that womens care work  that involves nurturing, caring, and sympathizing is devalued across occupations (England et al 1994; Killbourne et al 1994).  This is due, in part, to a process of differentiation (Reskin 1988), whereby dominants devalue the supposedly innate skills of subordinates.  Yet, much of the ethnographic research on how womens care work is devalued has taken place in settings where we might expect it, such as law firms, (Lively 2000, Pierce 1995), and engineering research firms (Fletcher 1999); or even in workplaces where the gender coding is mixed, such as academia (Bella 1999) or an alternative health organization (Kleinman 1996).  Data collected from participant observation and in-depth interviews show that even in a womens organization that explicitly valued care work, an agency that assists victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, the female staff still sought out to enhance the value of their labor by highlighting their proficiency with confusing civil and criminal legal procedureswork coded as masculine.  This legal work offered them a readily available opportunity to counter implicit (and sometimes explicit) accusations that their services were merely intuitive, not technical or skillful.
0	Market models of school choice predict that allowing parents and students to choose schools will increase achievement by increasing competition between schools, forcing them organize more effectively in order to retain a clientele of students (Chubb & Moe 1990).  Using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, I test the market model of school choice.  The results provide little support for market claims.  Public schools of choice appear to be no more organized than regular public schools.  Moreover, although Catholic and non-Catholic private schools have higher school organization scores, greater achievement gains in these schools are not mediated by school organization. These findings have important implications for market-based reforms in education.
0	This study of the emergence of the U.S. wind energy sector between 1978 and 1992 contributes to an expanding literature in economic sociology focused on the factors that promote regional entrepreneurial activity.  Most work on regional clusters of existing economic activity focus on how the material resource environment sustains these clusters.  In this study we focus on the emergence of new types of economic activity and how this is shaped by regional differences in the institutional and material resource environment.  Our results suggest that key elements of both the material resource and institutional environments increase regional entrepreneurial activity in the wind power sector.  We also find that the institutional environment moderates the effect of the material resource environment on entrepreneurial activity in this emerging sector.  Our results demonstrate the importance of studying the primary drivers of entrepreneurial action, those social processes and structures that infuse economic activities and their associated resources with meaning.

The first category are what I term ""popular science"" environmental organizations, which are organizations dedicated to ecological preservation through science; the second category includes environmental organizations focused on a) indigenous peoples, b) cultural heritage, c) religion, and d) women. Both types of organizations are common worldwide, but popular science organizations were generally founded earlier than were other organizations. After reviewing several theoretical accounts of the growth of fields of ecology organizations, including environmental realist, postmaterialist, resource mobilization, new class, and world society theories, I present an alternative, mass-education model of mainstream environmentalism that theorizes the relationships between systems of mass education and the founding of voluntary and scientific organizations. Using event count regression models, I explore the effects of both material and social factors on the founding of both types of organizations, and attempt to sort out the effects of education variables on foundings. Results of the event count analyses in 43 nations between 1968 and 1995 most strongly support environmental realist arguments and the mass education model, provide some support for world society perspectives, and do not support resource mobilization or new class theories. However, ""popular science"" and non-science organizations appear to have distinct social bases."
1	Why do some social movement leaders work harder than others? And, how does gender affect the patterns we uncover? Utilizing historical case study evidence of local chapters in the emerging movement opposing drinking and driving we are able to develop and test theoretical expectations about predictors of weekly effort among MADD and RID leaders. Taken together, our model explains 45 percent of the variation in leadership effort. We find bureaucratic complexity and victim support activities are more powerful predictors of effort than are individual leader characteristics, although all are important. Further analysis reveals that gender almost wholly conditions the strong effect of bureaucratic complexity on leadership effort so that increasingly complex chapter structures are associated with substantial increases in work hours for women but not men.
1	"Reports from academic and media sources assert that many young people substitute non-vaginal sexual activities for vaginal intercourse in order to maintain what could be called ""technical virginity."" Explanations for technical virginity, however, are based on weak empirical evidence and considerable speculation. Using a sample of 15-19-year-olds from Cycle 6 of the National Survey of Family Growth, we examine technical virginity and its motivations. The results suggest that religious adolescents are less likely than less-religious ones to opt for non-vaginal sex over total abstinence. Abstinence pledgers who are virgins are neither more nor less likely than nonpledgers who are virgins to substitute non-vaginal sex for intercourse. Moreover, religion and morality are actually the weakest motivators of sexual substitution among adolescents who have not had vaginal sex. Preserving technical virginity is instead more common among virgins who are driven by a desire to avoid potential life-altering consequences, like pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.

1	Fixed- and random-effects models for longitudinal data are common in sociology Their primary advantage is that they control for time-invariant omitted variables However, analysts face several issues when they employ these models One is the choice of which to apply, another is that FEM and REM models as usually implemented might be insufficiently flexible For example, the effects of variables, including the latent time-invariant variable, might change over time The latent time-invariant variable might correlate with some variables and not others Lagged endogenous variables might be necessary Alternatives that move beyond the classic FEM and REM models are known, but they involve estimators and software that make these extended models difficult to implement and to compare This article presents a general panel model that includes the standard FEM and REM as special cases In addition it provides a sequence of nested models that provide a richer range of models that researchers can easily compare with likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics Furthermore, researchers can implement our general panel model and its special cases in widely available structural equation models software
1	We investigate the association between a subjective measure of social status and the reasons for immigration among Asian immigrants in the US. We use data from the National Latino and Asian American Study to test several hypotheses about this association. Our analyses show the positive effect on perceived social standing of migrating for better education, the negative effect of migrating to seek employment, and the negative impact of refugee status. Migrating for family reunification can be associated with various circumstances, which lead to differing outcomes. The results suggest that the notion that immigrants arrive in the US with limited resources and few skills and move slowly up the socioeconomic ladder must be reassessed in light of the complex social context and factors such as ethnicity, gender, divergent immigration paths, and a range of associated circumstances. 
0	Newspapers are very important institutions in contemporary societies.  They are, however, also subject to the pressures of commercial competition.  This paper applies a theory developed by McPherson (1983) and colleagues to understand the way in which newspapers are affected by shifting competitive pressures in their market.  Newspapers are located in a socio-demographic space on the basis of the age and education of their readers.  The competitive intensity across this socio-demographic space is calculated each year.  Variation in this intensity is used to predict the movement of newspapers; that is, changes in the demographics of their readers.  The theory is partially supported by the empirical analysis.
1	"Theory suggests that neighborhood effects depend not only on where individuals live today, but also on where they lived in the past. Previous research, however, usually measures neighborhood context only once and does not account for length of residence, thereby understating the detrimental effects of long-term neighborhood disadvantage. This study investigates effects of duration of exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods on high school graduation. It follows 4,154 children in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, measuring neighborhood context once per year from age 1 to 17. The analysis overcomes the problem of dynamic neighborhood selection by adapting novel methods of causal inference for time-varying treatments. In contrast to previous analyses, these methods do not ""control away"" the effect of neighborhood context operating indirectly through time-varying characteristics of the family; thus, they capture the full impact of a lifetime of neighborhood disadvantage. We find that sustained exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods has a severe impact on high school graduation that is considerably larger than effects reported in prior research. We estimate that growing up in the most (compared to the least) disadvantaged quintile of neighborhoods reduces the probability of graduation from 96 to 76 percent for black children, and from 95 to 87 percent for nonblack children."
0	My paper elaborates on Putnams (2000) assertion that working class voluntary associations serve as schools for democracy by developing the civic capacity of their members.  Drawing on original survey and qualitative data gathered from Latino immigrant parents who belong to a Los Angeles labor union, I will discuss how labor union participation, within the context of a revitalized labor movement, relates to parents civic engagement in their childrens schools.  Regression analysis of survey data reveals that labor union participation is positively associated with political forms of school-based civic engagement, namely involvement in school decision-making meetings and school improvement efforts.  Meanwhile, qualitative data show how labor union participation provides Latino immigrant parents with confidence and problem-solving, advocacy, and organizing skills that enable them to act upon their interests and concerns within the school context.  Findings suggest that labor union participation contributes to the political incorporation of Latino immigrant parents and helps them overcome barriers to civic engagement.
0	In this project I analyze Nickelodeon cartoons for the messages they send about race, racism, and the racial order.   My research builds off the research findings of Ausdale and Feagins (2001) observations of young children at play, which show that children as young as three have both learned and learned to do race and racism.  Given these counter-intuitive findings, I utilize a combination of quantitative content analysis and qualitative textual analysis to examine the extent too which Nickelodeon cartoons justify and perpetuate the racial hierarchy.   I ground my cartoon analysis in a systemic theory of racism, which frames racism as an ongoing, all-encompassing, systematic, foundational system of power and oppression, created by whites, that advantages, privileges, includes, and normalizes whites and whiteness, while oppressing, disadvantaging, excluding, and othering blacks and other persons of color.  My results confirm many of the findings that previous scholars have found -- whites are overrepresented at all character levels (lead characters, major characters, minor characters, and background characters), multiracial cartoon casts are more common in current cartoons than in the past, and representations of people of color are generally more positive than in previous cartoon eras.  In addition, a deeper analysis reveals that, despite Nickelodeons rather successful effort to diversify their animation and move past racial stereotypes, these cartoons continue to justify and perpetuate the racial hierarchy.  These themes of white supremacy that emerged from the analysis fall into four categories -- general trends, interracial friendships, representations of people of color, and representations of whites.
1	The upswing in economic inequality that has affected a number of advanced industrial societies in the late 20th century has been particularly conspicuous in the United States. The authors explore its causes using data on the distribution of family income in 3,098 U. S. counties in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. The authors build a model of within-county income inequality that assumes that distribution processes involving labor market and sociodemographic variables operate primarily at the county level and those involving the political and institutional context operate primarily at the state level. Multi-level methods are used to distinguish county cross-sectional, state cross-sectional, and longitudinal effects on inequality. The authors find that, when features of the state-level institutional and political context are associated with inequality, these effects are larger longitudinally than cross-sectionally. A range of other factors, including economic development, labor force changes, shifts in the racial/ethnic and gender composition of the labor force, educational expansion, and urbanization are found to have comparatively large effects, both longitudinally and cross-sectionally.
1	Social capital has been alleged to increase the capacity for political mobilization. Yet, until now, the empirical debate has not succeeded in rendering a detailed account of the relationships between social capital and political participation partly because of the use of a reductive conception and operationalization of both concepts. Using a multidimensional and relational technique (multiple correspondence analysis) and a detailed youth survey data from Belgium, the article demonstrates that youth draw on diverse forms of social capital and that these forms vary along socio-economic status and ethnic origin. Six classes based on the forms of social capital were identified. Two of them - the 'Committed' and 'Religious' are highly political active. The 'Committed' Class, based on a diversified social capital, consists mainly of non-immigrant youth with a high socio-economic background undertaking a large diversity of political activities. The 'Religious' Class, based on a narrow social capital built around religious activities, is mostly composed of ethnic minority youth with a low SES involved in more specific political activities.

0	A growing body of literature links religiosity to a variety of health measures.  This strong positive association is hypothesized to operate through mechanisms such as health behaviors, social support, and coping strategies.  Overwhelmingly, the present knowledge of the connection between religion and health focuses on the United States.  Using data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, this paper seeks to answer the question of whether or not a similar link may be found between religiosity and health in the Russian Federation.  Beginning with a cross-sectional analysis, the results indicate that much of the story is lost when health is considered a stable variable and health trajectories are ignored.  The longitudinal section of the analysis presents a complex picture of religions effect on health in Russia, with religious people tending to report both positive and negative changes in self-evaluated health.  This analysis highlights the importance of utilizing more than one time point and of considering trajectories in health research.
1	This essay examines factors that produce political unity among large U. S. corporations advocating free trade. Expanding on old debates, these data and analyses validate the importance of organizational and class cohesion approaches to corporate political action. Methodologically, the political unity of pairs (dyads) of firms in trade policy activism is analyzed with quadratic assignment procedure regression. Shared membership in prominent policy networks and board interlocks positively predict corporate political unity across three areas of trade policy influence, from the executive branch to the legislature. Non-network organizational indicators also significantly predicted corporate trade policy activism. The findings support business unity accounts of corporate political action and suggest that higher levels of firm embeddedness within intercorporate networks facilitate collective corporate political action.
0	This paper uses findings from a qualitative case-study of a continuation high school, a public secondary alternative education program for dropout and pushout that are overrepresented by children of color, which posed questions about the role this school served within the city’s central school district.  The author employs the paradigm of critical race theory in education to analyze the founding historical precepts of alternative schooling, the school experience of youths who attend this continuation high school, and the process of student enrollment. Utilizing the critical race theory concept of Whiteness as property, specifically the property functions of 1) the rights to use and enjoyment; and 2) the absolute right to exclude, the author found that the role of this school was to effectively maintain and protect Whiteness as property through the systematic removal of nonwhite students from the districts mainstream high school into a substandard alternative school lacking in material and intellectual resources. Furthermore, this paper reveals how teachers, counselors, and administrative staff at the mainstream and continuation high schools alike drew upon the racial ideology of merit and hegemonic stories to rationalize the overrepresentation of nonwhite youths at the study school and to deracialize the student referral process.
0	The homophily principle applies to general social networks and the homogamy principle to specific dyadic networks, couples. Homogamy studies are traced back into the beginning of the 20th century. Among them, the trend of educational homogamy has received more academic attention. Few studies on this trend, however, pay attention to the institutional perspective. Some studies simply apply hypotheses and findings in certain societies into others without taking into account disparate institutions in different spaces over time. This preliminary study attempts to explore the effects of shifting institutions on educational homogamy, using urban China as an example. The modern history of China is characterized by varying policies, whose Cultural Revolution illegitimated human capital. Thus this paper hypothesizes that the strength of association in terms of couples education during the Cultural Revolution will be weaker than those before and after this period in terms of the rational choice theory. Findings from log-multiplicative layer effect models using the data The State and Life Chances in China: 1949-1994, gives empirical support. Finally, this paper suggests that the modernization theory need further specification and test. It also implies that sociologists explicitly introduce the institutionalism into social networks analysis, the social capital theory and the stratification theory, and explore the dynamic network formation and capital access across historical places and time under the structural constrains. Additionally, the competing results regarding the trend in educational homogamy in urban China still ask for further studies.
0	Investigating the effects of political capital on health in China in the mid 1990s, this paper explores the health implications of political power, an important measure of social conditions that has been neglected in existing literature.  The study indicates that cities have become the center of socioeconomic reform of China, since the 1990s.  Political capital still played an important role in resource allocation in the mid-1990s, as reflected in health advantage of the politically advantaged.  Compared with cadre status, membership in the communist party is a more salient and powerful influencing factor of health.  Party members and cadres gain health promoting resources, both monetary and non-monetary, largely through the work unit system.  Meanwhile, human capital shows positive rewards for health as well.  Findings suggest that human capital influences health through a new market centered redistributive logic as well as through the traditional political capital based resource allocation.  The former is evident by dramatic increases in earning returns to education, while the latter is evident by growing role of education as a consideration in entry into and promotion in the communist party and administrative career.
0	This paper revisits Clifford Geertzs classic study of the Balinese cockfight. It adopts Geertzs analytical insight that careful ethnographic observation of a societys games of chance can generate insight into its larger culture and social structure.  The authors own ethnographic data on the organization of casino card games in contemporary South Africa are compared to the Balinese cockfight.  Three differences are delineated, regarding: 1) the position of gambling as an institution within the larger social structure; 2) the organization of the games themselves; and 3) the specific subjectivities produced by participating in the contests.  These three differences, it is argued, derive from divergent trajectories of post-colonialism in Indonesia and South Africa.
0	How do organizational forms develop?  We analyze organizational characteristics of charter schools in Arizona over a six-year time period (1996-2001) to assess the extent to which coherent patterns of association among organizational elements emerged.  Using stochastic block-modeling developed by Snijders and Nowicki (2001), we determine that two subforms emerged, which we refer to as the family and personal service (FPS) model and the enriched elementary model.  Second, we assess what kinds of factors influence the inclusion of FPS elements in charter schools.  We find that competitive relations induce mimetic isomorphism, except in cases where a great deal of public choice was previously institutionalized.  In desegregated districts, where magnet schools gave potential entrepreneurs more prior experience with public choice schooling, schools were more likely to differentiate from competitors.  This evidence suggests that collective learning of an organizational form results from local political and relational struggles to define appropriate models of organizing.
1	Previous studies have shown that residents of neighborhoods with the concentration of poverty and female-headed households are at higher risk for depression. This study examines the effect of socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood on individual mental health by considering two possible mediating mechanisms: perceived neighborhood disorder and social relationships (social support and neighborhood social ties). The data were obtained from the 1995 Community, Crime, and Health survey sample consisting of 2482 adults and from a 1998 follow-up survey. Findings indicate that residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher levels of psychological distress than do residents of more advantaged neighborhoods with the introduction of social relationships and neighborhood disorder as mediators. Neighborhood disadvantage is associated with depression in three ways: (1) neighborhood disadvantage increased depression directly, (2) neighborhood disadvantage increased depression by way of neighborhood disorder, and (3) neighborhood disadvantage decreased depression through enhanced social relationships. 
0	"To what extent do college students from diverse social classes accept the legitimacy of the class system?  Thirty students from a highly selective liberal arts college (half from very affluent families, and half from families qualifying for financial aid), and 15 students from a nearby state college (virtually all from working class backgrounds) were interviewed. All were white and of traditional college age. Regardless of their class background, the students displayed a positive acceptance of their status, with lower income students focusing on character traits they gained through their families' economic struggles, and noting that they were better off than many poorer families in the U.S.  Lower income students tend more to dismiss the importance of class to their identities, to ""push class aside.""  They show a lower level of political interest, and do not question the basic fairness of the social system. The State College students anticipate careers with lower power and income than the other groups, and thus all three groups have ""realistic"" aspirations, and their sense of relative achievement appears likely. Further research, with larger and more racially diverse samples, is needed to examine the interaction of class, race and gender in the legitimization of the class structure."
1	Why do beliefs that attach different amounts of status to different categories of people become consensually held by the members of a society? We show that two microlevel mechanisms, in combination, imply a system-level tendency toward consensual status beliefs about a nominal characteristic. (1) Status belief diffusion: a person who has no status belief about a characteristic can acquire a status belief about that characteristic from interacting with one or more people who have that status belief. (2) Status belief loss: a person who has a status belief about a characteristic can lose that belief from interacting with one or more people who have the opposite status belief. These mechanisms imply that opposite status beliefs will tend to be lost at equal rates and will tend to be acquired at rates proportional to their prevalence. Therefore, if a status belief ever becomes more prevalent than its opposite, it will increase in prevalence until every person holds it.
1	"Recent disasters have been of such scale and complexity that both the common assumptions made about learning from them, and the traditional approaches distinguishing natural from technological disasters (and now terrorism) are thus challenged. Beck's risk thesis likewise signals the need for a, paradigmatic change. Despite sociological inflections in disaster research and management, however, an examination of the risk ""management practices deployed during Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami reveals attendant problems with a persistent instrumental rationality and disjuncture between society and environment. Therefore, an alternative, post-social understanding is proposed. It includes relational (rather than instrumental) approaches which reinstate the importance of nonhuman nature, but it also recognizes that disasters are post-normal problems, and that disaster research and management increasingly deal with phenomena beyond the limits of current know-how"

1	Why did the nation-state proliferate across the world over the past 200 years, replacing empires, kingdoms, city-states, and the like? Using a new dataset with information on 145 of today's states from 1816 to the year they achieved nation-statehood, we test key aspects of modernization, world polity, and historical institutionalist theories. Event history analysis shows that a nation-state is more likely to emerge when a power shift allows nationalists to overthrow or absorb the established regime. Diffusion of the nation-state within an empire or among neighbors also tilts the balance of power in favor of nationalists. We find no evidence for the effects of industrialization, the advent of mass literacy, or increasingly direct rule, which are associated with the modernization theories of Gellner, Anderson, Tilly, and Hechter. Nor is the growing global hegemony of the nation-state model a good predictor of individual instances of nation-state formation, as Meyer's world polity theory would suggest. We conclude that the global rise of the nation-state is driven by proximate and contextual political factors situated at the local and regional levels, in line with historical institutionalist arguments, rather than by domestic or global structural forces that operate over the long duree.

1	"It is widely argued that globalization and economic development are associated with international migration. However, these relationships have not been tested empirically. We use a cross-national empirical analysis to assess the impact of global and national factors on international migration from less-developed countries. An interdisciplinary analytical framework is developed. We then use several modeling techniques to analyze panel data on a set of less-developed countries from 1970 to 2000. Three central findings emerge from these analyses. First, foreign direct investment has a significant, differential effect across sectors of the economy: FDI in the primary sector increases the level of net emigration, while FDI in the secondary sector has a deterrent effect. Second, economic development has a significant, nonlinear effect on net emigration levels, the so-called ""migration hump."" Finally, we find a strong cumulative causation effect of migration, meaning that migration has a strong internal momentum after it has been initiated. The implications of the findings are discussed in the context of contemporary migration theory."
1	Studies that examine the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and weight are limited because residents are not randomly distributed into neighborhoods. If associations are found between neighborhood characteristics and weight in observational studies, one cannot confidently draw conclusions about causality. We use data from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) that contain body mass index (BMI) information from all drivers holding a Utah driver license to undertake a cross-sectional analysis that compares the neighborhood determinants of BMI for youth and young adults. This analysis assumes that youth have little choice in their residential location while young adults have more choice. Our analysis makes use of data on 53,476 males and 47,069 females living in Salt Lake County in 2000. We find evidence of residential selection among both males and females when BMI is the outcome. The evidence is weaker when the outcomes are overweight or obesity. We conclude that studies that ignore the role of residential selection may be overstating the causal influence of neighborhood features in altering residents' BMI. 
1	This study investigates racial differences in the short-term and long-term effect of living in public housing as a child on socioeconomic attainment among young adults from low-income families. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data and state-level public housing information, propensity score matching estimations addressed the self-selection problems encountered when evaluating the impact of welfare programs. The study findings indicate that Blacks with short-term public housing residence during adolescence seem to be more disadvantaged in terms of housing self-sufficiency and car ownership in an early adulthood than their low-income Black counterparts who lived in private housing. In the long run; however, public housing residence had very small effects on socioeconomic attainment of both White and Black young adults. The benefits of public housing in terms of providing a secure residence for economically vulnerable groups; therefore, outweigh any potential negative impacts. 
1	A growing body of research investigates the possible relationships between religion and mental health. After developing a series of arguments linking various aspects of religion with anxiety and tranquility, we test relevant hypotheses using data from the 1996 General Social Survey. Results show that frequency of religious attendance and the belief in an afterlife are inversely associated with feelings of anxiety and positively associated with feelings of tranquility. However, frequency of prayer has no direct association with either outcome. Strong beliefs in the pervasiveness of sin are positively linked with anxiety but unrelated to tranquility. Finally, belief in an afterlife and frequency of prayer buffer the adverse effects of poor health and financial decline on anxiety. Implications of these findings are discussed along with study limitations and promising directions for future research.

We also study the importance of high school characteristics in predicting future labor market performance. We conduct analyses for three major racial/ethnic groups in the US: Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics, employing data from two rich longitudinal studies: NLS and NELS. Our results indicate that while some school characteristics are positive and significant predictors of future wages for Whites, they are less so for the two minority groups. We find significant wage gender disparities favoring men across all three surveys in the 1970s, 1980s, and 2000. The wage gender gap is more pronounced in higher paid jobs (90th quantile) for all groups, indicating the presence of a persistent and alarming ""glass ceiling."" (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1	Power is at the core of feminist theories of sexual harassment, although it has rarely been measured directly in terms of workplace authority. Popular characterizations portray male supervisors harassing female subordinates, but power-threat theories suggest that women in authority may be more frequent targets. This article analyzes longitudinal survey data and qualitative interviews from the Youth Development Study to test this idea and to delineate why and how supervisory authority, gender nonconformity, and workplace sex ratios affect harassment. Relative to nonsupervisors, female supervisors are more likely to report harassing behaviors and to define their experiences as sexual harassment. Sexual harassment can serve as an equalizer against women in power, motivated more by control and domination than by sexual desire. Interviews point to social isolation as a mechanism linking harassment to gender nonconformity and women's authority, particularly in male-dominated work settings.
1	"One of the unintended consequences of decades-long public housing policy has been to concentrate the poor within communities that are at the extreme end of economic disadvantage. More than in other types of disadvantaged communities, living in public housing can sharply circumscribe the social world of its residents and isolate them from people and social institutions in surrounding areas. This study draws on the concepts of social isolation from urban sociology and offending ""awareness space"" from environmental criminology to explain why violence rates are dramatically higher in public housing compared to otherwise disadvantaged nonpublic housing neighborhoods and, moreover, whether residents or outsiders are responsible for the violence. Using homicide data for the Southeast Policing Area of Los Angeles (1980 through 1999), and relating the location of homicides within and outside of public housing to the places of residence of both victims and offenders, our research reveals that public housing developments are hotbeds of violence involving predominantly local residents. There is no evidence that public housing serves as either a magnet for violence by drawing in nonlocal offenders, or a generator of violence in surrounding neighborhoods. We conclude that this social isolation from the larger community can both escalate violence between residents inside public housing, but also limit their offending awareness space, such that the violence is contained from spreading beyond the development."

These studies find that whereas low-status actors are penalized for defying categorical boundaries, high-status actors have greater latitude to behave non-conformingly. In this paper I suggest that whether status has an effect on the rewards and penalties for categorical non-conformity is contingent on the existence of a collectively agreed-upon metric for assessing performance: when performance is consensually measurable, status plays a negligible role in mitigating the effects of categorical deviance. I test this hypothesis by comparatively examining two online social networks: one dedicated to music, the other to financial investments. I find that status is far less consequential in the financial investment community – where performance is easy to measure – than it is when people exchange music. Moreover my findings suggest that performance-measurability affects how categorical identity is interpreted by market actors. When performance-measurability is low, identity serves as a signal about quality; when it is high, identity functions as a lens through which performance is evaluated. The implications of these findings for understanding incentives for innovation and non-conformism are discussed.
1	"In spite of the fact that more than 10 percent of Americans claim no religion, academic investigations of the ""nones"" represent an underdeveloped area in the sociology of religion. We find that people with religiously unaffiliated parents and those who attended religious services less as a child are more likely to claim no religion. In addition, we find a strong association between having a spouse and peer group that are non-religious and claiming no religion."
1	How does neighborhood poverty affect the poor ability to access resources such as health care and job information? Most studies have focused on individuals or neighborhoods; we focus on organizations - specifically, whether organizations are less connected if located in poor neighborhoods. Our case study is childcare centers. We ask whether centers' organizational ties provide parents access to important resources, and whether neighborhood poverty affects this capacity. Based on qualitative fieldwork in 23 New York City centers, we develop hypotheses about this process. We test them on a representative sample of 293 centers. Findings uncover that centers provide important resource-access through their ties and that neighborhood poverty does not undermine this capacity. We suggest that organizational ties may help explain the inconsistent results Of the neighborhood effects literature.
0	While the relationship between law and the economy has occupied a prominent role in socio-legal scholarship, the historic shift to a new economy and its impact on law has received scant theoretical attention from contemporary socio-legal scholars.  This is surprising considering that the new economy has reoriented many aspects of social life, including the contractual relationship between workers and their employers.  Once characterized by guarantees of indefinite employment, employees in the new economy have a tenuous relationship with employers, experiencing greater instability and assuming personal risk. This transformation of the employment contract provides an ideal arena for reigniting investigation of the relationship between law and the economy.  In this paper I submit Canadian wrongful dismissal claims heard to judgment in two recessionary periods, the 1980s and the 1990s, to qualitative content analysis.  Embodying a natural experiment, the 1980s recession was characterized by large scale unemployment but post-war discourse supporting the traditional employment relationship remained intact.  The 1990s recession experienced similar levels of unemployment but was coupled with a new discourse on the employment relationship borne from the expansion of organizational downsizing across North America.  I develop and test hypotheses of judicial rhetoric in wrongful dismissal claims in the two economic contexts and conclude by discussing the implications of my findings for socio-legal theory and research.
1	Numerous researchers discuss the solidarity-producing effects of crime, natural disasters and mass tragedies; however, there is much we do not understand about the processes involved in the phenomena. We specify the social relationships that generate and sustain solidarity by building on Hunter's descriptions of the private, parochial and public spheres of community. We argue that event-specific parochial and event-specific public activities generate solidarity after heinous crimes. However, general parochial activities, such as attending local organizational meetings and frequenting local businesses, sustain solidarity. Using longitudinal data collected after the mass murder of 27 students and 5 faculty members on Virginia Tech's campus in 2007, a repeated measures analysis predicting levels of solidarity 5, 9 and 13 months after the tragedy supports our hypotheses.
1	Integrating an analysis of fields into studies of social change provides a better understanding of the outcomes achieved by challengers. We demonstrate the value of field analysis through a case study of a social change effort regarding urban land use. An organization led by wealthy and well-connected individuals pressed city government and a powerful for-profit developer to incorporate progressive social goals into a new urban development project. We show how the organization was able to achieve success in the policy formation field but faced significantly more obstacles when trying to enter another field (policy implementation), despite its elite status. Thus, using fields to study the case can bolster scholars' understanding of elite power and status, as well as help explain outcomes. The advantages enjoyed by elites can be field specific rather than universal, and so do not translate automatically into successful challenge results.
1	This study investigates ethnic outgroup feelings from a multigroup perspective. We test predictions from the similarity principle and intergroup contact theory, claiming that people are more positive towards similar others and that outgroup exposure leads to outgroup attraction. Multilevel analyses on dyadic ingroup-outgroup pairs gathered from a Dutch survey on four ethnic minority groups show that similarity (especially in group characteristics) positively affects favorable outgroup feelings. Outgroup exposure has a non-linear, reversed U-shape effect: a growing share of an ethnic outgroup in the neighborhood of residence initially increases favorable outgroup feelings, yet when the ethnic outgroup is large, further growth decreases favorable feelings. We also find a similarity by contact interaction, such that when group similarity is high, outgroup exposure generates more favorable feelings. The latter finding integrates two rather separate research fields and supports the equal status condition from intergroup contact theory. 
0	The paper examines the tensions within a vocal section precipitated by the promotion of a soloist from within the group through auditions within a choral setting.  These phenomena are then explained within the framework of Georg’s Simmel’s micro-conflict theory.  The soloist plays the role of Simmel’s Stranger.  Additionally, the effects of competition and jealousy are discussed with regard to the changes in structure and interaction of the group.  It is ultimately determined that conflict in the Simmelian sense acts as a musically beneficial force for the group as a whole, despite the presence of inter-personal conflict which may at first promise to be nothing by destructive to the group.
1	"Disaster studies have made important progress in recognizing the unequally distributed consequences of disasters, but there has been less progress in analyzing social factors that help create ""natural"" disasters. Even well-known patterns of hazard-creation tend to be interpreted generically - as representing ""economic development"" or ""capitalism"" - rather than through focusing on the more specific dynamics involved. We illustrate this point with two recent and well-known cases of flooding - those in the tipper Mississippi River Valley and in the Katrina-related devastation of New Orleans. In the former case, damage was caused in part by building the very kinds of higher and stronger floodwalls that were shown to be inadequate in the latter. In the New Orleans case, a more important factor in the death and destruction was the excavation of a transportation canal. fit both cases, and many more, the underlying causes of damage to humans as well as to the environment has involved a three-part pattern, supported by the political system - spreading the costs, concentrating the economic benefits and hiding the real risks. In very real senses, these have been floods of folly, created not just by extreme weather events, but by deadly and avoidable patterns of political-economic choices. Comparable patterns appear to deserve greater attention in other contexts, as well."
1	Extant research shows that individuals who discuss politics and current events with their peers also participate more actively in civil society,. However, this correlation is not sufficient evidence of causation due to a number of analytical biases. To address this problem, data were collected through a panel study conducted on students who were randomly assigned to dormitories during their first year of college. In addition, the data were preprocessed before analysis with a matching procedure. These data show that discussing politics and current events caused these students to participate in civic activities during their first year of college. A follow-up study conducted on the same population during their fourth year of college shows that the positive effect of civic talk on civic participation still exists despite the passage of three years. Further analysis shows that the boost in civic participation initially after engaging in civic talk is the mechanism by which the effect of civic talk lasts into the future.

0	In this paper, I argue that psychedelic substances served as a doorway through which spirituality entered the scientific laboratory with greater epistemological purchase than is typical for such a historically demarcated and epistemologically incommensurable knowledge system.  Because of this incommensurability, psychedelic scientists sought legitimize the scientific study of spirituality through psychedelic substances using what I call tactics of legitimation.  These tactics were:  access to spirituality, the measurement and operationalization of spirituality, the therapeutic application of spirituality and the explanation of spiritual beliefs in indigenous contexts.  Drawing on feminist epistemology, I frame this intersection of spiritual and scientific knowledges as a hierarchical collision between subjugated and dominant knowledges themselves productive of and produced through the politics of location around race, class, gender and nation.  I examine this intersection in order to explicate how dominant-subjugated knowledge relationships are negotiated and enacted across these tactics of legitimation   Through this analysis I argue that this collision did not result in a rejection of spirituality or a rejection of science but rather a polyvalent and contradictory history whereby some aspects of science were reinforced, often in a classically colonial manner, and still other aspects of scientific dominance were challenged.
1	Much of the immigration literature in the United States points toward a positive association between religious activity and immigrant economic adaptation. Immigrant congregations serve as informal job fairs, build social capital for entrepreneurial activity, and provide a locale for leadership skill development. Using the New Immigrant Survey, this hypothesis of religion as economic resource is tested among immigrants receiving permanent residency within the United States in 2003. Somewhat surprisingly, most findings indicate a null relationship between religion and economic outcomes (i.e. employment, occupation status, and earnings). However, in instances where a significant relationship does exist, non-Protestant immigrants suffer the greatest economic penalty, particularly among non-Protestants who are not regularly participating in a religious organization. In contrast, non-Protestants who regularly participate have a higher likelihood of employment and higher earnings than their non-participating counterparts. Therefore, this paper extends previous literature in specifying that the religion as resource hypothesis operates best for non-Protestant immigrants who are actively involved in their religious organizations. 
0	This paper joins an emerging body of literature on the effects of working-time arrangements and choices on gendered occupational outcomes, in particular on patterns of occupational sex segregation. In contrast to previous explorations of the relationship between part-time work and occupational sex segregation, we adopt a multidimensional approach to the study of sex segregation. We argue that specifying three distinctive two-way interactions of sex-by-occupation, sex-by-employment status, and occupation-by-employment status should be the steppingstone for the analysis of the relationship between sex, occupation, and employment status. Utilizing the 2000 U.S. Census 1-percent public use microdata sample files, we find that through the joint influence of working-time sex segregation and deindustrialization, employment status mediates some of the relationship between sex and occupation. In contrast to earlier studies we employ a margin-free segregation index, and find a lower degree of segregation in the part-time workforce than in the full-time workforce. We explain this finding in terms of the demographic characteristics of part-time workers. The implications of these findings for future analysis of occupational segregation and part-time work are discussed.
1	This research investigates variation in hate crime offending against Arabs and Muslims across U.S. counties in the months before and after September 11, 2001. Four questions are of particular interest. First, what were the determinants of anti-Arab and Muslim hate crimes prior to 9/11? Second, in what social contexts were Arabs and Muslims at greatest risk of victimization? Third, to what extent did hate crimes against these groups increase after the terrorist attacks? And last, did the predictors of hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims change appreciably after 9/11? Findings show that hate crimes targeting Arabs and Muslims increased dramatically in the months following 9/11, although the structural determinants and geographic concentration of these crimes remained largely consistent after the attacks. Negative binomial regression results further suggest that counties with larger concentrations of Arabs and Muslims have higher incidents of such hate crimes, which likely reflects the availability of targets for this type of offending. At the same time, the likelihood of victimization for a given Arab or Muslim person is lowest in counties where the percent Arab or percent Muslim is highest, in line with a power-differential perspective on discrimination and intergroup violence. The findings imply, that terrorist attacks may indeed incite retaliation and set off a wave of hate crime offending, but the location of these crimes is likely to remain consistent after a galvanizing event.
0	This study examines the influences of race, ethnicity, national origin, and immigrant generational status on eighth-graders’ academic self-concept.  Analyzing data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, kindergarten Class of 1998-99, we find that racial/ethnic differences in verbal/reading and mathematics self-concept are less pronounced than such differences in academic performance. Controlling for students’ family SES, reading and math ability at school entry, and gender, racial/ethnic minority adolescents tended to demonstrate high levels of academic self-concept, particularly among the children of immigrants. Findings suggest that individual and family background factors tend to depress minority students’ academic self-concepts. However, results also indicate that community and school factors may influence adolescents’ self-concepts in the opposite direction, serving to promote higher levels of academic self-concept. In addition to making white/minority comparisons, the present study examines academic self-concept differences within racial/ethnic and national origin groups according to adolescents’ generational status. Two key findings emerged from this line of inquiry: (1) net of individual and family background measures, adolescents with foreign-born mothers tended to demonstrate equal or higher levels of academic self-concept than their co-ethnic peers with native-born mothers, and (2) for certain racial/ethnic and national origin groups, school and community context measures mediated these within-group differences.
0	A neglected element of analysis of major social movements has to do with the turning points that emerge in the course of their struggle and that profoundly alter the trajectory both of the movement and of the conflict between the movement actors and organizations and the state against which they are contesting.  This paper first discusses what turning points are, and then examines the revolutionary upheaval that was embodied in the Solidarity union which emerged after a decades-long period of struggle against the Communist government in Poland.  It focuses on two turning points in the course of the conflict between the union and the state; these turning points were crucial to the outcome of the struggle.  One occurred during the period when Solidarity was legal and embodying a conflict with the Communist Party and the government it controlled.  The other took place after the union had been delegalized and driven underground.  In the first case, the turning point changed the momentum of struggle that had begun with Solidarity and saw the union on the offense; when it was over, the reverse was the case.  In the second case, the murder and its discovery of a popular priest by members of the secret police seriously weakened the government and gave new life to the opposition.
1	It has been argued that the effects of the desegregation of public schools from the late 1960s onward were limited and short-lived, in part because of white flight from desegregating districts and in part because legal decisions in the 1990s released many districts from court orders. Data presented here for 1970-2000 show that small increases in segregation between districts were outweighed by larger declines within districts. Progress was interrupted but not reversed after 1990. Desegregation was not limited to districts and metropolitan regions where enforcement actions required it, and factors such as private schooling, district size, and inclusion of both city and suburban areas within district boundaries had stronger effects than individual court mandates.
1	Studies of religion public roles typically concern the ways in which religious frameworks justify opinions and actions. This article draws from participant-observation research to show how people also use religion to define the boundaries of group identities and relationships. Importantly, people do this in situation-specific ways that we cannot predict from people religious reasons for public actions. Evidence comes from two religiously-based organizations sponsored by the same local religious coalition, studied during 1998 to 2000 in a midsized US. city. One group is an alliance of lay people representing different churches, who organized volunteering and community development projects with a low-income minority neighborhood. The other is an alliance of clergy, representing different churches, that organized public events against racism. In each case, group members used religious terms to argue sharply over civic identity despite sharing the same religious reasons for their goals. Resolving the disputes required redefining or reemphasizing the boundaries of collective identity. The dynamics highlighted in my analyses provide new ways of understanding how people use religion to include or exclude others in civic relationships. Even more broadly, they reveal how religion can enhance or impede collaboration across social status and religious divides.
1	"The authors consider how uncertainty over protest occurrence shapes the strategic interaction between companies and activists. Analyzing Wal-Mart, the authors find support for their theory that companies respond to this uncertainty through a ""test for protest"" approach. In Wal-Mart's case, this consists of low-cost probes in the form of new store proposals. They then withdraw if they face protests, especially when those protests signal future problems. Wal-Mart is more likely to open stores that are particularly profitable, even if they are protested. This uncertainty-based account stands in sharp contrast to full-information models that characterize protests as rare miscalculations."
1	"This article examines how lesbian, gay, and straight-but-affirming members of lesbian- and gay-affirming churches in the South challenged a deep-rooted Christian belief in homosexual sin. Data are taken from 200 hours of participant observation and 25 in-depth interviews in two Protestant churches: one predominantly black, working class, lesbian, and evangelical, and the other mostly white, middle class, heterosexual, and liberal. I identify three strategies lesbian, gay, and straight-but-affirming church members used to accommodate-but not assimilate-to heteronormative conceptions of the ""good Christian."" First, some black lesbians minimized their sexuality as secondary to the Christian identity. Second, most lesbian and gay members-both black and white-normalized their sexuality by enacting Christian morals of monogamy, manhood, and motherhood. Third, a small group of black lesbian/gay and white, straight-but-affirming members moralized their sexuality as grounds for challenging homophobia in the church. Using these strategies, church members both resisted notions of homosexual sin and reproduced a ""politics of respectability"" (Warner 1999) among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Findings shed empirical light on two issues in the social problems literature: (1) the inseparability of race and gender from sexual identity; and (2) the importance of an intersectional analysis in assessing the possibilities of faith-based strategies for sexual equality."
0	To date, most comparative studies of environmental reform have focused on the experiences of advanced, industrialized societies in Europe and the Americas.  Discussions of multi-level and multi-actor governance, shifts in governance styles and the changing role of the nation-state have been supported empirically by case-studies from these regions.  Existing research may have limited applicability to conditions and processes of environmental reform in Asia, a continent of crucial importance for the global environment.  In addition, significant methodological challenges exist in operationalizing and measuring environmental reform in Asia and elsewhere.  This paper explores possibilities and requirements for addressing such questions and challenges, through an analysis of official data and other sources relating to trends in environmental performance in 19 market-oriented states in South, Southeast and East Asia, over the last several decades.  It asks, What evidence is there of improvements (or declines) in environmental quality?  Where there are changes in environmental performance, how can these be interpreted?  To what extent can improvements be attributed to innovations in environmental policy and practice?  Preliminary findings, interpretation, and assessment are presented, along with a call for new, quantitative and qualitative, comparative analyses of environmental reform in Asia.
0	The recent global integration of financial markets generates a pressing debate on the impact of global capital on the domestic markets. We challenge the singular linear causal link between foreign capital and its resulting outcomes and develop two-way measurements in assessing the consequences of the flowing of global capital: how open a domestic economic system is to foreign capital on the one hand and how foreign investors are embedded in the institutional underpinnings of a domestic market on the other hand. Through analyzing a longitudinal data from China’s public-listed firms between 1994 and 2003, we have several findings. First, foreign investors could positively affect firm performance only when they partnered with domestic shareholders in this market. Second, the positive effects of foreign shareholders varied across different partnerships with local companies. Foreign investors’ partnership with state owners was weaker than their partnership with private investors. Finally, the increase of foreign shares did not necessarily result in the proportional increase of their positive role. When foreign investors dominated in a firm’s ownership structures, their positive effects faded away. This study suggests that the quantities of foreign investments as standard economic indicators only partially impact economic outcomes. The qualitative involvement of global investors in the institutional contexts of host countries shapes organizational consequences in a more deterministic way.
0	In this paper we discuss theoretical and methodological problems of analyzing globalization through the lens of Indigenous Peoples. We discuss various mainstream and critical approaches toward globalization, and their weakness when including Indigenous Peoples, with an eye toward world-systems analysis providing the better but still insufficient platform. We then consider how contemporary inter-state systems contribute both to a distorted or incomplete analysis, even when using a transnational perspective, evidenced in the resistance to the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, notably by core, neoliberal states. Finally, we review and consider how Indigenous relations to the land and environment and community based economies of scale are in opposition to market driven notions of privatized property and profits. We conclude that not only should further study take these paradigms and analytical models into their general modeling processes, but that some Indigenous Peoples may well provide important clues toward alternative social organization forms with less overall conflict in highly globalized world problems such as environmental destruction and increased internal and inter-state warfare.
0	Scholars interested in racial and ethnic residential inequality frequently focus on intercensal change in levels of segregation. However, prior scholarship has not estimated effects of theoretically important variables on changes in segregation conceptualized as a growth curve over a relatively long period of time. In this paper we use hierarchical linear modeling techniques (HLM) to estimate linear growth in residential inequality for a sample of U.S. cities from 1970 to 2000. In these models, repeated observations of metropolitan areas (MAs) are nested within those MAs. The results provide estimates of four indexes of residential inequality in 2000 (Dissimilarity, Isolation, Net Difference, and Entropy) and the MA-level predictors of those indexes. In addition, HLM enables the estimation of 1970 to 2000 change, as well as the predictors of that change. We find that although Blacks continue to be more segregated than either Asians or Latinos, Blacks have experienced substantially greater declines than either of the other two groups. We estimate that if 1970 to 2000 trends continue, Latinos will overtake Blacks as the most residentially segregated and stratified race-ethnic group by the end of the current decade.
0	This paper will examine the experiences of South Florida immigrant women and men from Latin American countries in order to determine the effects various types of social networks have on their perceptions of gender equality in America. Through the formation of social ties, immigrant women in particular realize increased opportunities for career, educational, and personal pursuits which also allow for their greater participation in their receiving societies. With this, immigrant women disrupt existing discourses which confine them to the traditional realm of femininity and improve their statuses through their connections with other women. Through a quantitative analysis, we seek to exhibit the non-discriminating effects of those incorporative networks which may allow for increased access to the larger American society, as well as ethnic and transnational social networks on women’s and men’s perceptions of gender equality. While some scholars argue that transnational and ethnic ties negatively influence immigrants, this study reveals the ways in which immigrants are both retaining ties to their ethnicities and their home countries, as well as forging new relationships between individuals outside these realms in order to improve gender equality.
0	Hurricane Katrina (August 29th 2005) is considered one of most devastating storms ever to occur in the United States (U.S.).  A major consequences of this disaster was a dynamic demographic shift in the ethnic and racial composition of New Orleans (United States Congress, 2006).  Although the New Orleans population is nearing 300,000, or about 65 percent of its pre-Hurricane Katrina size, the African American population has fallen substantially from 67 percent prior to the storm.  Concomitantly, there has been a dramatic increase of the Latino population from 3% pre- Katrina to over 20 percent. These Latinos are mainly comprised of single, poor, undocumented immigrant men working in the demolition and construction trades. Despite this groups high immigration, and some initial research before Katrina (Sorenson, 2001), little is known about patterns of the adaptation and settlement in these new destinations for Hispanic immigrants. the Center for Drug and Social Policy Research (ODSPR)  conducted two focus groups and 52 qualitative interviews with undocumented Latino day laborers in New Orleans.   Focus groups were recruited by the NDRI fieldworkers who are involved in an ethnographic study of the Post- Katrina drug market.   The qualitative interviews were   in-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 52 male immigrants living in New Orleans.  Participants were recruited from 6 day labor sites in metropolitan New Orleans. Findings indicate new settlement patterns for Latinos resulted in increased high risk behavior related to issues of social isolation, depression and lack of social capital.
0	In a modern society, mass media play a dual role as a “motor” and a “mirror” of social reality.  This paper illuminates the “bridging” process of media representations, in which an “incident” of crime is transformed into an “instance” of a larger social problem.  Based on an analysis of the 2003 Fukuoka Family Murder Case in Japan, this paper argues that media reports bridge a particular crime case with social problems and a minority group status through intuitive bridging and analytical bridging.  This tragic muder case evoked a serious controversy over immigration policies in Japan when the offenders were identified to be Chinese students who had come to Japan on student visa, then dropped out of school.  In reporting this case, Japanese newspapers repeatedly referred to suspects using their nationality and immigration status.  This collective naming created an intuitive mental association between crime and the immigration status.  Furthermore, editorial articles present structural analysis of the case, arguing that the lack of proper immigration control is the root cause of the crime.  This narrative of the crime bridges crime and an immigration problem analytically, implying other students who are in the same situation are at high criminal risk.
1	This article examines how suicides influence suicide risks of others within two interaction domains: the family and the workplace. A distinction is made between dyad-based social-interaction effects and degree-based exposure effects. A unique database including till individuals who ever lived in Stockholm during the 1990s is analyzed. For about 5.6 years on average, 1.2 million individuals are observed, and 1, 116 of them commit suicide. Controlling for other risk factors, men exposed to a suicide in the family (at work) are 8.3 (3.5) times more likely to commit suicide than non-exposed men. The social-interaction effect thus is larger within the family domain; yet work-domain exposure is more important for the suicide rate because individuals are more often exposed to suicides of coworkers than family members.
0	In the later half of the 1990's the landscape of daytime, syndicated television significantly changed. In response to criticisms in both the political sphere and popular press, The Jerry Springer Show and the Trash Talk genre severely restricted itself. In response to falling ratings, a new wave of an old format -- the Mock-Courtroom show -- was quickly ushered in. In the last five years many academics and writers in the popular press have not only compared the two genres, but also claimed that they are fundamentally similar. A 30 hour content-analysis of the three most highly rated Mock-Courtroom shows highlights the fundamental differences between the formats, as well as the drastic changes in how gender, race, and difference are performed on daytime TV. This conclusion is bolstered by a content analysis of online message boards. Fans of the Mock-Courtroom format not only contrast the genre with Trash Talk shows, but also identify with a dominant reading of the text.
1	This study examines whether long work hours exacerbate gender inequality. As working long hours becomes increasingly common, a normative conception of gender that prioritizes men's careers over women's careers in dual-earner households may pressure women to quit their jobs. I apply multilevel models to longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to show that having a husband who works long hours significantly increases a woman's likelihood of quitting, whereas having a wife who works long hours does not appear to increase a man's likelihood of quitting. This gendered pattern is more prominent among workers in professional and managerial occupations, where the norm of overwork and the culture of intensive parenting are strong. Furthermore, the effect is stronger among workers who have children. Findings suggest that overwork can reintroduce the separate spheres arrangement, consisting of breadwinning men and homemaking women, to many formerly dual-earner households.
1	Young adults at the turn of the 21st century came of age in a time of unprecedented access to credit but slowed growth in earnings, resulting in a dramatic increase in indebtedness. Debt has been little studied by sociologists, even though it is increasingly important in financing both attainment and a middle-class lifestyle, especially for youth in the transition to adulthood. We study the consequences of indebtedness for young adults' sense of mastery and self-esteem as stratified by class. Young adulthood is a crucial developmental period for mastery and self-esteem, which then serve as a social psychological resource (or deficit) into the adult years. Research suggests that young people have divergent perspectives on debt: some focus on credit as a necessary investment in status attainment, while others worry that readily available credit invites improvidence that can erode the self-concept as debt encumbers achievement and future consumption and increases a sense of powerlessness. We find that both education and credit-card debt increase mastery and self-esteem, supporting the hypothesis that young people experience debt as an investment in the future, and contradicting the expectation that debt used to finance current spending will lower mastery and self-esteem. Our expectation that debt effects are accentuated for those of lower- and middle-class origins but blunted for those of upper-class origins is supported. We find, however, that the positive effects of debt appear to wane among the oldest young adults, suggesting the stresses of debt may mount with age. We conclude that further study of the long-term consequences of debt will be essential for advancing contemporary stratification theory and research. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	"The research findings with respect to the relationship between incarceration and employment are consistent enough that it is tempting to conclude that incarceration causes deterioration in ex-inmates' employment prospects. Yet, causality remains tenuous for several reasons. For one, studies frequently rely on samples of nonincarcerated subjects that are not truly ""at risk"" of incarceration, which undermines their use as comparison samples and potentially biases estimates of the impact of incarceration on life outcomes. Additionally, even with confidence about causal identification, the field remains ignorant about the precise mechanism by which incarceration erodes employment and earnings. To address these gaps, this study uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to estimate the impact of incarceration during late adolescence and early adulthood on short- and long-term employment outcomes. The subjects of interest are all individuals who are convicted of a crime for the first time, some of whom receive a sentence of incarceration following their conviction. Broad measures of legal and illegal employment are used to explore possible avenues by which incarceration affects individual work histories."
1	Although multiple race responses are now allowed on federal censuses and surveys, most interracially married single-race parents report a single race for their children. It is well-established that the social context of these racial identification decisions affects their outcome. This research focuses instead on the physical context. It is argued that homelands - physical places with cultural meaning - are an important component of the intergenerational transfer of a single-race identity in indigenous mixed-race families. To test potential explanations for the relationship between homelands and indigenous identities, this research focuses on families in which an interracially-married American Indian lives with a spouse and child and was included in the Census 2000 5% Public Use Microdata Sample. Logistic regression reveals a strong effect of living in an American Indian homeland on the child's chances of being reported as single-race American Indian. This effect remains even after accounting for strong ties to American Indians and other groups, family and area poverty levels, geographic isolation, and the racial composition of the area. The intergenerational transmission of strong identities continues in this multiracial era (as it has for centuries) in the context of culturally meaningful physical places. 
0	"Demographic predictions about the growth of the Latino and Asian American populations in the United States have prompted both ""whitening"" and ""browning"" theories of how this growth will alter (or not) US race relations. Such theories often expect Latinos and Asian Americans to either become like whites or else like blacks, without much attention to how these middle groups might affect more unique changes to the racial landscape. Using data from 50 in-depth interviews with Latinos and Asian Americans, I focus on (1) how their racial identities are perceived by others and how they feel about other ethnic groups; (2) the types of discrimination and prejudice they encounter; (3) the ways they employ and innovate racist ideology; and (4) their antiracist outlooks. Defying simplistic predictions, Latinos and Asian Americans relatively greater connection to a global community than either blacks or whites becomes relevant in explaining some of these unique experiences."
0	Gender and race are intertwined contexts that account for variation in the resource-health relationship, yet most research ignores this social reality, over-generalizes findings, and, in all likelihood, obscure the complexities that the dual interlocking systems of gender and race create.  This study seeks to address this issue by examining stress outcomes  distress and substance abuse  by race/ethnicity and gender.  A second purpose of our study is to examine exposure and vulnerability to a major life stressor among a sub-set of the population who have high exposure to social stressors; the incarcerated.  Using the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities, we examine differential distress and substance abuse by race/ethnicity and gender, differential exposure to pre-incarceration physical abuse, and vulnerability in the association between physical abuse and stress by race/ethnicity and gender.  Our results indicate that consistent with studies of the general population, African Americans have lower rates of depression and substance abuse compared with whites and Hispanics.  Compared with rates in the general population, incarcerated individuals report higher likelihood of experiencing pre-incarceration physical abuse, but unlike the general population, whites have substantially higher rates of physical abuse.  Results of regression analyses indicate that the association between physical abuse and distress is similar for all groups, but the association between substance abuse and physical abuse is substantially higher for women and Hispanics.  We discuss these results with reference to the stress process literature and research on the differential stress and well-being of the incarcerated.
1	In this study, we investigate how structural economic changes constrain an equality project, the public-sector expansion strategy. First, we describe a three-stage process in which a growing productivity gap between the private-manufacturing and public-service sectors disrupts traditional class solidarity. We contend that emerging conflicts between private and public sectors due to public-sector expansion and a growing inter-sectoral productivity gap eventually lead to employment and budget crises, as well as the weakening of coordinated wage-setting institutions. Furthermore, political, institutional, and economic transformations originating from sectoral cleavages and imbalance lead to increased income inequality. We test this argument using an unbalanced panel dataset on 16 advanced industrial democracies from 1971 to 2003. We find that public-sector employment has a strong negative effect on income inequality when the productivity gap between sectors is low. In such situations, public-sector employment fulfills its promise of equality and full employment. However, as the inter-sectoral productivity gap increases, the negative effect of public-sector expansion on income inequality evaporates. The findings suggest that severely uneven productivity gaps due to different degrees of technological innovations significantly weaken and limit the effectiveness of left-wing governments' policy interventions through public-service expansion.
1	This study focuses on the factors underlying differences in relationship quality between interethnic and same-ethnic couples. Using the National Survey of Families and Households and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we examine relationship satisfaction, interpartner conflict and subjective assessments Of relationship instability in married and cohabiting couples. Partners in interethnic unions generally reported lower levels of relationship quality than did partners in same-ethnic unions. These differences held for women as well as men, and for married as well as cohabiting couples. Differences in relationship quality were largely accounted for by more complex relationship histories, more heterogamous unions, fewer shared values and less support from parents. In contrast, differences in socioeconomic resources did not appear to play an explanatory role.
0	Numerous studies have observed health advantages for new immigrants to a country relative to the native-born population. This phenomenon, often referred to as the ‘healthy immigrant effect’, persists in many cases despite immigrants’ social risk factors that normally suggest poorer health profiles. However, much of the existing research has been conducted in the United States or has been limited to analysis within a single country. Few studies have attempted to analyze this relationship between migration and health cross-nationally. Using data for 17 countries from five rounds of the European Social Survey (2002-2010), this paper examines cross-national variations in migrant health status. Although the healthy immigrant effect is present in some countries, foreign-born populations have poorer health in others. The high level of heterogeneity between countries suggests immigrant health patterns are not generalizable across contexts and may not be fully explained by existing theoretical perspectives.
1	Do alcohol use and binge drinking among Latina/o adolescents increase in the second and third generation? This study explores generational differences in alcohol use behaviors for three Latina/o ethnic groups. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health on 1504 Latina/o adolescents in secondary school, we found that the factors associated with alcohol use behaviors differed across the Latina/o groups. For Mexican and Cuban adolescents, but not Puerto Ricans, immigrant generation was associated with alcohol use. For Mexican, but not Cuban adolescents, acculturation mediated the effect of immigrant generation on alcohol use behaviors. Although generally social capital and a coethnic presence were protective factors against alcohol use behaviors, we found that some forms of social capital were actually risk factors for Cubans and Puerto Ricans. Our results provide support for segmented-assimilation theory. 
1	"Data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 are used to estimate the effect of type of disability (in order of frequency, learning, other, emotional, hearing, visual, physical and speech impairment) on young people's progress toward four adult transitions: finding full-time employment, establishing an independent residence, marrying and having children. I find that young people who have a visual, hearing, speech or ""other"" impairment are more likely than their nondisabled peers to find themselves among the respondents who did not complete any of the adult transitions examined in the analysis. Young people who have a learning disability are also more likely to be in a ""just workers"" group (i.e., respondents who are still living at home, for the most part, but working fulltime)."
1	"Previous literature suggests a tenuous link between fathers' care of children and maternal employment and earnings. This study shows that the link is stronger when measures of caregiving capture fathers' increased responsibility for children. The analysis of time diary data from 6,572 married fathers and 7,376 married mothers with children under age 13 indicates that fathers (1) engage in more ""solo"" care of children when their wives are employed, (2) are more likely to do the kind of child care associated with responsibility for their children when their wives spend more time in the labor market, and (3) participate more in routine care when their wives contribute a greater share of the couple's earnings. In addition, the ""father care"" to ""mother care"" ratio rises when mothers contribute a greater share of household earnings."
0	In the modern global economy, firms frequently face pressures to move certain corporate functions abroad in order to take advantage of lower production costs and tap into new emerging markets for their products and services. Using data from an exploratory fieldwork in Taiwanese computer industry, this paper examines how corporate and social network changed in situations when the industry moved production processes offshore. The findings suggest that companies migrated with their suppliers and maintained a close relationship in order to cope with the uncertainty they encountered during the relocation to China. Yet a high degree of market uncertainty also motivated manufacturers to withdraw from their obligations to the suppliers and back away from exclusive partnerships. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of the resulting closer but less committed supplier relationships after the business relocation.
1	One of the most prominent explanations for Minority underachievement in the labor market is what has been termed the spatial mismatch hypothesis. The original formulation of the hypothesis by John Kain focused on the effects of racially Segregated housing on workers' labor market outcomes assuming race-neutral employers. This paper reports the results of a case study designed to test Kain's original conception of this important hypothesis within the context of a longitudinal analysis of a relocating food processing plant. Because the workers in this study did not choose the firm's new location, the relocation can be treated as an exogenous, demand-side shock to the local labor market. This natural experiment design solves the major problem of extant approaches to the theory, i.e., the selective migration of minorities to areas with high concentrations of jobs. The study design also eliminates the confounding factor of non-race-neutral employers using space as a means to discriminate against minorities since the circumstances of this move make us confident that the firm is not moving for racial motives. We find support in favor of Kain's version of the spatial mismatch hypothesis. Despite the firm's best intentions and work to minimize the impact of the spatial disruption caused by the relocation, the racial segregation of the area's housing market hampered minorities' adjustments to the relocation. Consistent with Kain's formulation, spatially discriminating employers are not needed to produce race differences in job accessibility; racially segregated housing markets alone can generate such outcomes. 
1	"The sociology of knowledge, derived from research on the hard sciences, overlooks the potential for outsiders to determine the content of knowledge within professional disciplines. Using the case of the Sally Hemings affair, I introduce the concept of ""knowledge advocacy"" to analyze how outside groups shape historical knowledge. The Hemings controversy involved not only historical evidence, but also the understanding of objectivity in historical research. Unfolding against the backdrop of the professionalization of history, outside advocates successfully challenged the disciplined understanding of ""objectivity as neutrality"" eventually embracing ""objectivity as the scientific method"" in their appeal to DNA testing. This study illuminates the strategic interplay between professional historians and outsiders engaged in knowledge advocacy, the role of objectivity in this struggle, and the potential vulnerability a discipline faces when the ideal of objectivity is compromised."
1	Prior research frequently observes a positive cross-sectional relationship between various neighborhood structural characteristics and crime rates, and attributes the causal explanation entirely to these structural characteristics. We question this assumption theoretically, proposing a household-level model showing that neighborhood crime might also change these structural characteristics. We test these hypotheses using data on census tracts in 13 cities over a ten-year period, and our cross-lagged models generally find that, if anything, crime is the stronger causal force in these possible relationships. Neighborhoods with more crime tend to experience increasing levels of residential instability, more concentrated disadvantage, a diminishing retail environment, and more African Americans ten years later. Although we find that neighborhoods with more concentrated disadvantage experience increases in violent and property crime, there is no evidence that residential instability or the presence of African Americans increases crime rates ten years later.
0	This paper examines the development of and competition between protest policing protocols in the U.S. from 1960 to 1980. Using qualitative data culled from multiple primary and secondary sources, the paper argues that four institutions-policing, professionalism, the courts, and protest-were critical in structuring both the development and selection of protest policing protocols. In doing so, this paper contributes to important debates in research on repression, social movements, policing, law and society, and new institutionalism.
0	This paper focuses on the impact of the current turf battle between certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and anesthesiologists (MDAs). After reviewing the history between the two occupations and the current turf battle, this paper presents survey data to explore the workplace interactions of CRNAs and their professional identity.  CRNAs are the sole anesthesia providers of approximately two-thirds of the nations rural hospital anesthesia care (Blumenreich 2004, 2000; Bettin 2001; Fallacaro and Ruiz-Law 2004). The ability of many rural hospitals to provide anesthesia services is dependent on CRNAs. Results are compared for those practicing in rural locations to those practicing in urban locations. The impact of the turf battle, as well as current changes in the health care system, such as changing workforce supply and technological developments on interactions with other health care workers and patients are presented. There are some significant rural-urban differences in professional identity and interpersonal relations in the workplace. CRNAs practicing in rural areas are less negatively impacted by the turf battle and feel more positive about technological developments in anesthesia than those CRNAs practicing in urban areas.
0	In recent years, sociologists and development practitioners have come to see social capital among the poor as an asset to be tapped for development and democracy. In the most rigorous application of the theory to rural India, Krishna (2002) argues that the social capital embodied in informal networks, when “activated” by young, well-connected village leaders, contributes to the ability of villages to undertake collective action and secure collective developmental goods. This article, based on an ethnography of villages in rural India influenced by a Special Economic Zone and accompanying land appreciation argues precisely the opposite. While turning rural land into real estate requires well-connected local villagers to act as “brokers,” building trust between far-flung parties to make transactions possible, this activation of their social capital allows them reap lucrative commissions while exploiting fellow villages. In the process, they undermine the norms and trust that could enable collective action. I conclude that social capital is best understood not as a collective asset adhering in large groups, but, following Bourdieu, a form of power based on unequal access to social networks. As an aspect of social structures of power and domination, it constitutes an obstacle, not a solution to “development.”
0	A status attainment perspective of immigrant integration suggests that the social and economic mobility of immigrants occurs over time and over generations, with first generation immigrants expected to have the least desirable outcomes. We examine this proposition in terms of homeownership, long viewed as an indicator of social and economic status, and compare the likelihood of ownership across immigrant waves and generations and across metropolitan areas in Canada. Data are taken from the 2001 Census of Canada Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) of individuals. Our analysis reveals that there are generational differences in homeownership in the expected direction but not when compared to the oldest immigrants of the first generation. The oldest immigrants, those arriving prior to 1981, are as likely as the 1.5 and second generations to own their homes, if not more. Our results also show that the type of homeownership also varies by generation, with newcomers being more likely than others to turn to the condominium market.
1	Collective memory quite naturally brings to mind notions of mnemonic speech and representation. In this article, however, we propose that collective silences be thought of as a rich and promising arena through which to understand how groups deal with their collective pasts. In so doing, we explore two types of silence: overt silence and covert silence, and suggest that each may be used to enhance either memory or forgetting. We illustrate our conceptual scheme using data on the commemoration of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
0	Previous research on unhoused youth, commonly referred to as “street kids,” has largely neglected examining the daily lives of these youth.  As a result, little is known concerning the details of street life for newly unhoused youth, the strategies used by unhoused youth to make it on the streets, and the factors that impede or promote an unhoused youth’s desire and/or attempt(s) to leave the streets.  Based on three years of ethnographic observation and twenty in-depth interviews with the unhoused youth of Hollywood, this paper explores the obstacles unhoused youth face when leaving and/or staying off the streets.  These include physiological and psychological obstacles (i.e., mental illness, addiction, a lack of motivation, giving up), biographic obstacles (i.e., lack of skills and work experience, criminal records, and difficulties showering, doing laundry, having transportation, and providing identification), and interpersonal obstacles (i.e., employers prefer not to hire unhoused individuals, expectations of loyalty and obligation among unhoused youth, a lack of support from unhoused youth, staff’s passive approach to service provision, and staff’s emphasis on structure, schedules, and rule enforcement rather than the needs of particular unhoused youth).  The paper then briefly examines the common elements among those unhoused youth who left and stayed off the streets.  Although very small in number, these youth were typically quite motivated to leave the streets, had few connections to street life, pushed staff at the various organizations to assist them, and received some type of assistance from housed family members or friends that helped them leave the streets.
1	This article compares marriage patterns by race, education and religion in the United States during the 20th century, using a variety of data sources. The comparative approach allows several general conclusions. First, racial endogamy has declined sharply over the 20th century, but race is still the most powerful division in the marriage market. Second, higher education has little effect on racial endogamy for blacks and whites. Third, the division between Jews and Christians is still strong, but the division between Catholics and Protestants in the marriage market has been relatively weak since the early 1900s. Fourth, educational endogamy has been relatively stable over time.
1	Although played out on a global stage, 9/11 and the Iraq War represent highly personal events for those connected to the victims. A social tie to a conflict casualty transforms abstract costs into a vivid personal experience that increases the likelihood an individual disapproves of the president. Despite variation between civilian and military losses and historically high and low levels of presidential support, those who know 9/11 or Iraq War casualties are consistently more likely to disapprove of President Bush, suggesting that social structure, and not just personal characteristics, influence wartime opinion.
1	Segmented assimilation theory has been a popular explanation for the diverse experiences of assimilation among new waves of immigrants and their children. While the theory has been interpreted in many different ways, we emphasize its implications for the important role of social context: both processes and consequences of assimilation should depend on the local social context in which immigrants are embedded. We derive empirically falsifiable hypotheses about the interaction effects between social context and assimilation on immigrant children's well-being. We then test the hypotheses using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our empirical analyses yield two main findings. First, for immigrant adolescents living in non-poverty neighborhoods, we find assimilation to be positively associated with educational achievement and psychological well-being but also positively associated with at-risk behavior. Second, there is little empirical evidence supporting our hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory. We interpret these results to mean that future research would be more fruitful focusing on differential processes of assimilation rather than differential consequences of assimilation. 
0	Changes in the nature of contemporary marriage have spurred a debate about the consequences of shifts to more egalitarian relationships, and public interest in the debate was aroused by a recent report by the Council on Contemporary Families (2008). While the report contained a variety of information, media attention focused on the claim that men who participated in housework got more sex.  To our knowledge, there is relatively little systematic or representative research that supports this claim, and, although there are a variety of theoretical reasons to expect that egalitarian marriages are higher quality, other research suggests the continued importance of traditional gender roles and gender display in marriage. Using data from Wave II of the National Survey of Families and Households, we investigate the links between mens participation in core (traditionally female) and non-core (traditionally male) household tasks, gender ideology, and sexual frequency. We find that couples with more traditional housework arrangements report higher sexual frequency, particularly when they also have conservative gender ideologies.
0	The study analyses the gender pay gap in private-sector management positions based on the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) for the years 2001-2008. It focuses on occupational gender segregation, and on the effects of this inequality on earnings levels and gender wage differentials in management positions. Our paper is, to our knowledge, the first in Germany to use time-constant unobserved heterogeneity and gender-specific promotion probabilities to estimate wages and wage differentials for persons in managerial positions. The results of the fixed-effects model show that working in a more “female” job, as opposed to a more “male” job, affects only women’s wages negatively. This result remains stable after controlling for human capital endowments and other effects. Mechanisms of the devaluation of jobs not primarily held by men also negatively affect pay in management positions (evaluative discrimination) and are even more severe for women (allocative discrimination). However, the effect is non-linear; the wage penalties for women occur only in “integrated” (more equally male/female) jobs as opposed to typically male jobs, and not in typically female jobs. The devaluation of occupations that are not primarily held by men becomes even more evident when promotion probabilities are taken into account. An Oaxaca/Blinder decomposition of the wage differential between men and women in management positions shows that the full model explains 65 percent of the gender pay gap. In other words: Thirty-five percent remain unexplained; this portion reflects, for example, time-varying social and cultural conditions, such as discriminatory policies and practices in the labor market.
1	Using data from a 2005 nationally representative survey of working adults residing in the United States, we show that education is associated positively with a sense of personal control. The well-educated have higher status occupations which include higher levels of schedule control, challenging, interesting and enriching work, greater economic rewards and security, and a higher level of trust. Collectively, these patterns contribute substantially to the association between education and sense of control. We also observe that demanding work has a negative effect on sense of control, but this emerges only after adjusting for other higher status work conditions that correspond with demands. Our observations inform the integration of theoretical perspectives to describe education benefits for personal and social functioning.
0	Past research has consistently reported a positive association between marriage and depression while also stressing the moderating effect of relationship quality on the marriage-depression link. Using a sample of African American young adults, this analysis examines how relationship quality conditions the effect of relationship status on depression using an internal moderator approach. In the analysis, relationship status is included as a dummy variable as well as a set of dummy variables (single, dating, and cohabiting).  Results suggest that while being in a relationship itself is not associated with depression, individuals in strained relationships report significantly more depressive symptoms than individuals in less strained relationships. Further, when examining relationship status using dummy variables cohabiting women in strained relationships report significantly more depressive symptoms. A second analysis using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model includes couples to control for the interdependence of relationship quality when examining its effect on depression. Results suggest that relationship quality influences depression even when controlling for partner interdependence and this holds for dating and cohabiting/married individuals. These findings suggest that relationship quality conditions the effect of relationship status on depression.
1	"While preference-based explanations play an increasing role in economics and sociology, the accurate measurement of social preferences deserves more attention. Most laboratory experiments measure social preferences by studying the division of ""a cake that nobody had to bake"" (Guth and Kliemt, 2003). This article reports results of the first ultimatum game experiment with bargaining over waiting time. The experiment was created to avoid effects of windfall gains. In contrast to donated money, time is not endowed by the experimenter and implies a natural loss to subjects. This allows for a better measurement of the inherent conflict in the ultimatum game. We implemented three anonymity conditions: one baseline condition, one condition with anonymity among subjects and one double-blind condition in which the experimenter did not know the division of waiting time. While we expected to observe less other-regarding behavior in ultimatum game bargaining over time, our experimental results rather confirm previous ultimatum game experiments, in which people bargained over money. The modal offer was half of the waiting time and only one offer was rejected. Interestingly, anonymity did not change the results significantly. In conclusion, our experiment confirms other-regarding behavior in the ultimatum game. "
1	Homophily promotes the development of social relationships within social groups and increases segregation across groups. Although prior research has demonstrated that network segregation operates in many dimensions such as race and gender, sexual orientation has received little attention. This study investigates what accounts for the segregation between gay, lesbian and bisexual friends and straight friends in GLB youth's personal networks by testing three possible underlying mechanisms - structural constraints, choice homophily and compartmentalization attempts. The analysis uses data collected from GLB youth who were becoming members of a community organization in Indiana from 1994 through 1998. Although the small, convenience sample does not allow generalization of the results, the rich network data provide important insights into personal network segregation in this unique social context. The results suggest that the segregation between GLB and straight friends result from structural constraints and friends' preference to interact within their groups, and that the focal GLB youth's effort to compartmentalize his or her sexual identity accounts little for the segregation.
0	Despite women’s considerable strides in higher education, horizontal inequities—such as sex segregation by major—remain. Existing scholarship suggests that women “indulge” in “gendered selves” during college, however, there is little understanding of why, how, or among whom this is likely to happen. Using two interconnected qualitative datasets, a longitudinal ethnographic and interview study of a dormitory floor of college women—tracking them as they move through college and beyond—and an interview study with their parents, I argue that gender-specific major choice is one indicator of a gender curriculum operating primarily in the social scene that lies beyond the classroom. The gender curriculum is a byproduct of a campus social life organized around gendered peer hierarchies, and focuses students’ attentions on their gendered selves. I describe the process through which some women more fully absorbed the gender curriculum, explain why others did not, and document the academic and career-related outcomes. I show that the costs of the gender curriculum are high for women, as it tracks them into traditionally feminine jobs that remain devalued and underpaid.
0	We analyze data from the 1997 wave of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY) to compare well-being (delinquency, substance abuse, and behavioral/emotional problems) among 12 to 17-year-old adolescents living with a cohabiting mother and her partner versus a remarried mother and her spouse.  The results indicate that maternal remarriage does not provide benefits over maternal cohabitation with regard to adolescent well-being, as no differences were found between adolescents residing in cohabiting and married stepparent families.  Instead, stresses, parental involvement, and parenting style (of both the biological parent and the stepparent) predict well-being, and these factors are not experienced differentially by adolescents of cohabiting and married stepfamilies.  We discuss the implications of our results for public policy.
0	In this paper we test for the existence of pathways of upward mobility for low wage workers by studying patterns of intragenerational occupational mobility in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) from 1979-2006.  We argue that “stepping stone” links of upward mobility between specific pairs of occupations can be identified by whether or not the accumulation of experience increases the probability of movement between these occupations.  In contrast, a “dead end” job is one which both pays low wages and where the accumulation of occupational experience reduces the probability of upward mobility.  We use two data sets to detect potential stepping stone links between occupations.  First, we measure the skill similarity between occupations using data on occupational skill requirements from the O*NET occupational database.  Second, we use data on occupational mobility from matched samples of the Current Population Survey (CPS) to identify possible career ladders based on either significant one-way flows between occupations or positive age effects on occupational transitions.  We test these links using data on career histories from the NLSY.  A key aspect of our approach is an empirical strategy that simultaneously models wage mobility (a dichotomous indicator of low versus high pay) and occupational mobility (among detailed 3-digit occupations).  In order to estimate our models with detailed occupations and multiple observations for each individual, we first randomly sample from the choice set of occupations and then use a latent-class conditional logit model (Train 2008) to allow for individual heterogeneity.

However, debt changes the calculus of viable state programs by either requiring stringent cost controls or very rapid short term results. Since the point of state led development is to permit ""patient"" long term initiatives - in most cases, the management of costs is now a critical parameter. This is difficult to manage in democratic societies where demands for expenditures are hard for states to resist. This is illustrated by an analysis of Prodetur - a joint effort of the Banco do Nordeste and the Interamerican Development Bank to create a tourist economy in the Brazilian Northeast. The program was a model of transparent, ecologically oriented, sustainable development - and produced substantial increases in employment and in quality of life. However these gains were not so rapid as to permit ignoring cost considerations altogether. Brazil incurred over $300 million in debt to participate in Prodetur - when viable alternative plans existed that would have produced nearly all of the same advantages for $0 in debt. The political forces that caused the more expensive option to be chosen are considered. The lesson is that globalization has not killed the developmental state - but has made stringent management procedures more important."
1	This study uses national survey data in federal election years from 1996 through 2004 to examine voter registration and voting. It shows that racial/ethnic disparities in socio--economic resources and rootedness in the community do not explain overall group differences in electoral participation. It contradicts the expectation from an assimilation perspective that low levels of Latino participation are partly attributable to the large share of immigrants among Latinos. In fact net differences show higher average Latino participation than previously reported. The study focuses especially on contextual factors that could affect collective responses of group members. Moving beyond past research, significant effects are found for the group's representation among office holders, voting regulations and state policies related to treatment of immigrants.
0	This study looks at the place of religion as a cultural element which, according to secularization theories, has been claimed to be incommensurate with modern liberal values, particularly within an Islamic civilization.  Here this study tests the Clash of Civilizations thesis developed by Samuel Huntington (1993, 1996, 1998) to determine the extent to which there is a cultural divide between a Western civilization and an Islamic civilization based on liberal values.  Using the World Values Survey and revisiting findings from Norris and Inglehart (2003), this study finds that part of the variance in liberal values between Western Christian respondents and Islamic respondents is explained by separating religion from civilization, interacting educational attainment with civilization, and including a civic involvement predictor.
1	The Catholic Church has had a strong influence on the Chilean legal and social landscape in ways that have adversely affected victims of intimate partner violence; e.g., it succeeded until just five years ago in blocking efforts to legalize divorce. At the same time, quantitative studies based on survey data from the United States and other countries show a generally favorable influence of religion on health and many other domains of life, including intimate partner violence. The present study explores the puzzle posed by these seemingly opposing macro- and micro-level forces. Results based on data from the 2005 Survey of Student Well-Being, a questionnaire on gender-based violence administered to students at a large public university in Chile, show that moderate or low levels of religiosity are associated with reduced vulnerability to violence, but high levels are not. This non-linearity sheds light on the puzzle, because at the macro level the religious views shaping Chile's legal and social environment have been extreme. 
1	We examine immigrant generation differences in college attendance and college type among youth ages 18 through 26 who have graduated from a US. high school. Results indicate that first and second-generation immigrants are significantly more likely to attend college than their third-plus generation counterparts of similar race/ethnicity, socioeconomic and family background characteristics. While parental behaviors and expectations for college attendance do not significantly mediate these generational differences, these factors appear to indirectly affect college-going behavior through their impact on students' verbal ability and academic achievement during high school. Interaction models including race/ethnicity and generation status reveal that the second-generation effects on college attendance are largely driven by Chinese youth, whereas the first-generation effects on college attendance are largely driven by black immigrant students.
1	A substantial body of literature purports to document the growth of scientific misconduct in Northeast Asia. This article traces the apparent growth of research fraud and falsification to two distinct features of the national innovation systems common to the region: liberal research regimes adopted by developmental states and marked by freedom from government oversight, and illiberal laboratory cultures imported from Germany and marked by all-powerful lab directors and their vulnerable underlings. Based on comparative, qualitative case studies of pioneering countries in bio-medical research, as well as cross-national quantitative analyses of the permissiveness of national stem-cell research policies, we argue that Asia's scientific pathologies are the products of two institutional factors: funding and freedom offered to scientists by developmental states, and the lack of informal control prevalent in the German model of higher education. We conclude that, while Northeast Asian officials offer their biomedical researchers funding and freedom to take advantage of opportunities that rarely exist in the West, their scientists stifle open debate and criticism, and thereby hinder the growth of informal as well as formal control mechanisms that are critical for deterring and detecting scientific fraud.
1	Navigating political action typically requires coalition building across different interest groups. Because members represent divergent interests and are embedded in different networks, however alliance formation is difficult. In this article, I consider how elites rely on political brokerage to overcome these divisions and form successful coalitions, with successful organization of the parliamentary opposition to the king before the English Civil War as a case in point. Supporting quantitative evidence comes from rich network data on the business, kinship, and political affiliations among 346 political and mercantile elites. Rather than the mere presence of mediator positions, I argue that effective brokerage of mobilizing alliances between interest groups requires political mediators who are equally affiliated with these diverse networks. Successful brokerage is conditional on both their structural position between groups and the diversity of ties that compose their personal networks. The results demonstrate that new merchant elites who were engaged in the American colonial trades acted as political mediators and facilitated the formation of a parliamentary opposition strong enough to defeat the royalist forces in London.
0	Increased remittances resulting from increased migration are clearly associated with producing short-run positive effects at the individual and local levels but, conversely, are said to cause longer-term, detrimental effects on a developing countrys overall economy.  These arguments present overly pessimistic views on the role remittances play in developing countries, and instead, argue for liberalized trade policies and opening markets to achieve growth and development.  Most empirical research focusing on remittances as a development tool explores migrant motivations for remitting and the short-term micro-effects they may have on individuals, households, and local economies, but fail to consider the longer-run effects on economic growth and development for developing countries.  This paper explores the current conjecture over remittances role in economic growth and development and the relationship between remittances and other, yet untested economic measures, proposing these better reflect the impact remittances have on developing countries' overall economies.  The findings of this work conclude there significant correlations between these economic variables and remittances; which, imply long- term economic growth is occurring as remittances increase within the developing countries.  Remittances and out migration are related to these variables and reflect increases in GDP, fixed capital formation, household consumption, domestic credit, and savings. These increases suggest that remittances are used for not only daily living expenses, but for productive purposes, including the creation of micro-enterprises.
1	We ask whether a social contrast mechanism depresses the educational aspirations of students with high-achieving peers. We study two entire cohorts of students in the final grade of the Swedish comprehensive school with matched information on social origin and achievements (160,417 students, 829 schools). Controlling for school fixed effects and observed characteristics of students and families, we find that the propensity to make a high-aspiring choice of upper-secondary school program is lowei-for students with high-achieving schoolmates, given own achievement. While theoretically interesting, the effect is small compared to that of own achievement: Moving an average student from an average school to a school that lies one standard deviation lower in achievement increases the probability of a high-aspiring choice by three percentage points.
0	Based on 15-months of ethnographic work in an eclectic Wiccan coven in the Northeast, I investigate the standard elements and creative improvisations across a series of ritual events sponsored by the group. I have uncovered a great deal of similarity in the structure of the rituals I have observed, as well as a great deal variation in the ritual body, or specific content of each ritual. While preserving the performance of particular rites, a standard order of events and a similar spatial lay-out, the coven is also able to adapt its ritual content to suit the theme which each particular event commemorates, as well as the type of ritual being conducted. The standards, traditions and norms of practice are preserved and serve to represent what defines religious practice for these individuals. For the members of the coven I studied, maintaining a regular set of actions and sequences within the ritual was as important as ensuring variation, freedom and openness to spontaneity. Traditional ritual structures and serious magical workings are combined with an aura of convivial sociability and playfulness, in a way that seems to transcend the boundaries often drawn between processes of structure and anti-structure.
1	Using data from a 2006-07 US survey of workers, we examine the association between creative work and work-to-family conflict, focusing special attention on the demands associated with creative work and their implications for work-family multitasking. Findings indicate that creative work is associated negatively with work-to-family conflict and stressful work-related thoughts-but these associations are suppressed by the following patterns: (1) creative work is associated with greater work demands; (2) those conditions are associated with higher levels of work-family multitasking; and (3) demands and multitasking increase work-to-family conflict and stressful boundary-spanning thoughts. Taken together, these patterns reveal suppression effects: Individuals with creative work would report lower work-to-family conflict and fewer stressful thoughts were it not for their exposure to work and boundary-spanning demands and their more frequent work-family multitasking. Collectively, our findings reveal previously undocumented patterns in the ways that the demands associated with creative work influence stress in the work-family interface. 
0	"Nearly one in four children within the United States has an immigrant parent or parents (Hernandez, 2004).  A significant portion of these children are born in the U.S. and are often referred to as second generation immigrants.  Second generation immigrants currently outnumber foreign-born children by more than six to one, a number that doubled in the past decade (Child Trends, 2010).  While many of the same socio-economic factors that negatively affect the outcomes of U.S. children also confront children of immigrants, they are additionally affected by risk factors unique to the immigration process, such as parental citizenship. As this contemporary second generation immigrant cohort transitions into adulthood, they will shape considerably the demographics of the young adult population.  Drawing from the life course perspective and resiliency theory, this study utilizes data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY: 1997) to examine how socio-economic and contextual factors within the family and community during adolescence impact the success of second generation immigrants once they reach young adulthood.  This study adds to the growing body of literature on the experiences of immigrants by examining not only traditional socio-economic measures of ""success"" but alternative measures such as health and life satisfaction as well.  Findings show that contextual factors early in life have an enduring effect in their transition to young adulthood, but  also suggest that the effect of contextual factors is dependent on the outcome examined.  Variation by racial groups also emerged across contextual factors and the multiple success indicators."
1	"Although some point to the large effects of schooling on civic engagement (usually measured in terms of volunteering and participation in civic organizations) and social cohesion (usually measured in terms of social networks and relationship quality), the effects of schooling on social outcomes have not been estimated with the same rigor as the effects of schooling on labor-market outcomes, such as earnings. In particular, previous research has failed to consider (i) the many potential and often unobserved confounding factors (""endowments"") influencing both schooling and social outcomes, including family upbringing, innate characteristics, and personality, and (ii) the ways in which schooling pushes individuals in multiple directions simultaneously, including toward greater social engagement, but also toward more independent and market-driven pursuits. Using samples of unrelated persons, ordinary siblings, and identical twins, this study explores the effects of schooling on measures of civic engagement and social relationships, as well as labor-force earnings and labor-force participation. The siblings models reveal a more complex picture than typically suggested by standard individual estimates. On one hand, the results reveal a robust positive effect of schooling on earnings: well-schooled persons work more and earn more, albeit not as much as associations without control for endowments suggest. On the other hand, the results reveal more tenuous and occasionally negative effects of schooling on social outcomes. The effects of schooling on volunteering and membership in civic organizations, for example, disappear almost entirely with control for endowments. Also, within-identical-twins models reverse the positive effects of schooling on reports of support from friends, family, and coworkers. These results may reflect the tension schooling creates between market and non-market commitments, as well as between independence and interpersonal reliability. Schooling may, indeed, induce some pro-social behaviors, but schooling allows individuals choices of whether to pursue more personal interests as well. "
0	This article explores the complicated identity of military peace movement activists. Using ethnographic data, including participant observation, in-depth interviews, and organizational archives, I explore the role of U.S. military veterans and families in the anti-Iraq War movement. Activist experiences cause these veterans and their families to distinguish themselves from the wider military, and they form a culture of action distinct from the larger peace movement in its goals, organizational forms, emotion culture, rituals, tactics, and strategies. In this article I highlight a hitherto neglected level of identity at work in social movement activism: the culture of action level of identity. This identity is broader than any single organization, but it is also separate from group identity as member of the military community and from the movement level within the wider peace movement. These activists are at once both insiders within the peace movement and within the military as well as outsiders within both of these groups. The military peace movement culture of action provides individuals a place to negotiate their seemingly contradictory identities as military and as antiwar activist.
1	This research uses panel data (1989-2003) to examine the relationship between per capita carbon dioxide emissions and exports for 169 countries. Fixed effects regression results indicated that within country worldwide exports and United States exports are positively related to per capita Carbon dioxide emissions. However, when both exports to the World and to the U.S. are examined simultaneously, only exports to the U.S. are related to carbon dioxide emissions. Additional analysis Suggests that not all exports to the U.S. are responsible for the carbon-exports relationship. Specifically, the association between per capita carbon dioxide emissions and exports to the U.S. is largely the result of the oil and gas, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and re-import industries. The data suggest consumption practices in the U.S. are partially responsible for elevated per capita carbon dioxide emissions in other nations, and that carbon dioxide trends in other nations are in part driven by U.S. demands for goods. These results also indicate that inefficient production methods among countries that export products to the United States may signal a problematic trend in global carbon dioxide emissions. 
0	Through an ethnographic study of a Chinese dance group in the Midwest region of the United States, I explore the following questions:  What does it mean to be Chinese in the context of a multicultural American society?  In what ways does Chinese dance facilitate the construction of group identities for recent Chinese immigrants?  In what ways are production and speculation of Chinese dance in the U.S. affected by the racialization of Chinese American identities?  And in what ways do Chinese dance production and speculation reinforce the racialization of Chinese Americans?  Drawing on the racial formation theory from Omi and Winant (1994), I unpack Chinese immigrants discourse on Chinese-ness against the background of multi-layered diversity within the Chinese Dance Group, and examine how mainstream American media and white American audiences receive Chinese dance.  Through explicating this discursive racial project around Chinese dance, I demonstrate the ways in which Chinese immigrants, their cultural practices and their group identities are racialized in the United States.  The racialization of Chinese American cultural practices and identities needs be understood in the context of broader racial formation processes.
1	Much research has found that more religious youth are less likely to engage in riskier health-related behaviors. However, very little research has examined the role that religion may play in shaping the health-related behaviors of secular youth. There is reason to think that more and less religious youth may gain some health-related benefits from involvement with religious organizations through activities such as basketball and volunteering. Using two waves of data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, this study finds that involvement in religion-supported secular activities is associated with less alcohol use for all involved teens. The number of friends who belong to a religious youth group, in part, explains the relationship. Conversely, network overlap between parents and teens, the number of friends who drink or use drugs, and having an adult confidant from a religious group are not mechanisms that mediate the relationship.

1	Using national data of the male population (a total of 715,000 observations) in Taiwan, this study finds a significant association between LBW and the probability of committing crime appears exclusively among those born to mothers under 18 or over 40 at the time of childbearing. Moreover, this association occurs particularly in violent crime. The interaction between biological and demographic factors suggests that being born to very old or young mothers and LBW together may create a double hazard of biological disadvantage, leading to higher risk of committing violent crime later. The other side of the coin is that, regarding to violent crime, being born low birth weight may not be a disadvantage unless it is triggered by certain adversity. 
1	The debate about racial residential preferences has two open questions. First, are neighborhood racial preferences truly racial, or is race a proxy for socio-economic factors? Second, are in-group or out-group preferences more salient? Using the Houston Area Survey, we employ a factorial experiment to assess the effect of racial composition on neighborhood desirability independent of crime, school quality and property values. We survey whites, blacks and Hispanics to examine in-group vs. out-group preferences. Results show that independent of proxies, whites find neighborhoods less attractive as the proportion black or Hispanic increases; the proportion Asian has no impact. Racial composition has little effect on Hispanics' and blacks' neighborhood preferences. We find no evidence of in-group preferences; rather, results suggest that whites express negative out-group preferences toward black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
0	As cities across the nation become increasingly diverse, particularly due to increasing Latin American immigration, the potential for inter-racial/ethnic conflict arises.  However, such demographic changes can also create potential for multi-racial/ethnic coalition building. Living under similar socio/economic conditions is not necessarily a sufficient condition to sustaining alliances across racial boundaries, since much depends on how issues are framed by community leaders. African American and Latino perceptions of one another are shaped by many factors, including the media, political elites, and community organizations, each employing varying frames for interpreting Black and Latino relations.  This paper explores how grassroots activists frame perceived commonality across racial/ethnic lines in a region undergoing major demographic changes.  By analyzing data gathered from participant observation of coalition interactions and activities, organizational documents such as newsletters and reports, and in-depth interviews with coalition members and organizers, this study finds that organizational leaders have attempted to build a coalition across racial/ethnic lines by deploying an injustice frame rooted in racial, economic, and regional inequality, as well as racialized discourse to construct a collective identity - that emphasizes Black and Latino commonality - based on neighborhood identity.  This case illustrates the importance of collective action frames in building African American and Latino alliances, even in the face of more prevalent counter-frames produced by mainstream media.  It also illuminates the key role that grassroots community organizations play in framing commonality across racial/ethnic lines that may lead to more successful coalitions.
0	As an explanation for cooperation in an one-shot prisoner’s dilemma game (PD), Kiyonari et al. (2000) proposed the social exchange exchange heuristic. The heuristic assumes that players put a premium on mutual cooperation. We extend the model by assuming that the premium differs across individuals, and is private information. Using this model we show that players face an inefficiency problem in the one-shot PD, meaning that two players who both prefer mutual cooperation over unilateral defection still fail to cooperate. We show how this inefficiency problem may be alleviated by considering sequential play of the PD and by repeating the PD twice. We derive that both players in the sequential PD cooperate more frequently than players in the one-shot simultaneous PD. In the two-shot PD the inefficiency problem is shown to still exist, and cooperation in the first round of the two-shot PD may be higher or lower than in the one-shot PD, depending on the payoffs and the distribution of premiums in the population. The paper concludes by suggesting some hypotheses for experimental testing.
0	Why do people move in Greater Lisbon (GL)? In the last decades GL has experienced a vast process of boom and abandonment, causing inner city decay and suburban sprawl. This paper demonstrates why moving to city and moving to suburbs corresponds to different processes of the citys transformations with sociological consequences and impact on public policies. This research uses qualitative methods: participant observation and in-depth interviews, and quantitative methods: multiple linear regression. According to the researchs results residence mobility results from social class mobility aspiration and household necessities. The reasons people move to Lisbon and to the suburbs are very different. The independent variables examined in Lisbon are: residents studying in Lisbon and extensive family. In the suburbs they are: extensive families, Africans immigrants from Former Portuguese Colonies, housing and residents employed in the tertiary sector. The results confirm GL to be an important case study in terms of the global phenomena of gentrification and the displacement process, with the following consequences: the increase in privatization of urban space via gated communities; spatial organization of ethnic, racial, and immigrant enclaves, housing and social cohesion.
1	As survey response rates decline, correlates of survey participation may also be changing. Panel studies provide an opportunity to study a rich set of correlates of panel attrition over time. We look at changes in attrition rates in the American National Election Studies from 1964 to 2004, a repeated panel survey with a two-wave pre-post election design implemented over multiple decades. We examine changes in attrition rates by three groups of variables: sociodemographic and ecological characteristics of the respondent and household, party affiliation and political and social attitudes recorded at the first interview, and paradata about the first wave interview. We find relatively little overall change in the pre-post election panel attrition rates, but important changes in demographic correlates of panel attrition over time. We also examine contact and cooperation rates from 1988 to 2004. 
0	The following paper examines how relationship-based power, individual status characteristics and gender ideology effect womens decisions to use condoms and test for HIV/AIDS .  Using individual based and relationship-based power conceptual approaches, this study underscores the importance of combining relationship based and individual factors into conceptual frameworks examining sexual decision making. Three hypotheses are formed; 1) in regards to gender ideology, women with low relationship-based power will express stronger agreement with traditional gender ideology.  As well, womens reports of condom use and HIV testing will be negatively associated with traditional gender ideology. 2) In regards to condom use, women with low relationship-based power will be associated with lower odds of condom use with sexual partners. 3) In regards to HIV testing, relationship-based power will not be associated with womens decisions to test for HIV.  Individual status characteristics will be better predictors of HIV testing among women.  Respondent data comes from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 5. Analysis finds complete support for first hypothesis, and partial support for 2 and 3rd hypotheses. Findings highlight the need to consider how partner characteristics affect decisions to use contraceptive as well as test for HIV.
0	The current economic climate is demanding more innovative approaches to increasing labor market participation of people with disabilities, as traditional employment programs and policies have failed to achieve their intended success. Social entrepreneurship can offer an alternative pathway to employment, however little is known about the broader factors that influence social enterprise start-up of people with disabilities. This paper uses empirical pilot data gathered through focus groups (n=27) with social entrepreneurs with disabilities in the Chicagoland area as well as interviews (n=19) with key stakeholders working in the fields of policy, disability, and business to understand: how social entrepreneurship can increase the participation of people with disabilities in the labor market; and the perceived barriers and facilitators for social entrepreneurs with disabilities in starting or growing a social enterprise. The paper begins with an overview of the rights of persons with disabilities, the current labor market context, and the role of social entrepreneurship as an alternative employment strategy. Empirical data is presented in the context of three key domains that influence participation of people with disabilities in social entrepreneurship: (i) Government (i.e. policies/laws to support social entrepreneurs); (ii) Economics (i.e. financial/funding issues that impact social entrepreneurial success); and (iii) Culture (i.e. the environment in which social entrepreneurs operate). Further consideration of these issues will provide a better understanding of the factors that enable people with disabilities to participate in social entrepreneurial opportunities, and how their start-up efforts can best be supported.
0	The siting of locally unwanted land uses  hazardous waste facilities, landfills, prisons, power plants, etc  often serves as a lightning rod for community mobilization. Recent attempts to site liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in California have proved no exception. However, whether, how and how fast these mobilization efforts activate the community and how they interact with more institutionalized processes for public participation in siting decisions remain relatively unexplored territory in the scholarly literature. This paper compares a conceptual framework drawn from the literature on social movements and facility siting to mobilization efforts against two proposals for LNG receiving terminals in California: (1) Mare Island Energy Project and (2) Cabrillo Port. My findings from these two cases suggest that it is not the individual factors presented in this conceptual framework (i.e., political opportunity, threat, resources and appropriation, trust) but their combination that is important in determining mobilization outcomes. Thus, deficiencies in one factor can be compensated for by surpluses in another. I present a revised conceptual framework based on the findings from these two cases. No longer a linear model for mobilization, this revised framework better describes the reality I found in my two cases.
0	In this study we examine the identity exploration possibilities presented by online multi-player games. Players today use graphical tools and character creation software to construct an avatar or character that serves as the visual personification of their online identity. In the fantasy world of games, the online identity could be entirely fictional and have little relationship to the offline self. Nonetheless, we argue that todays online multi-player games, as did yesterdays, offer players an attractive opportunity to create a representation of themselves through their character that reflects and approximates an idealized version of themselves.  Drawing from theories of online identity exploration and self discrepancy, we predicted players would create a main character more similar to their ideal self than to themselves.  Our results show that participants do realize aspects of their ideal selves through their characters, but not in all dimensions.  We also hypothesized that individuals with higher ideal self discrepancies would be particularly likely to idealize their characters.  Indeed, the phenomenon was strongest among those having high levels of depression and low self-esteem.  We propose that enacting a virtual self with a smaller self-discrepancy that approximates how one would like to be could have positive implications for ones identity and well-being, particularly for those with large ideal-actual self discrepancies.  We discuss implications for self discrepancy theory, for the study of online social interaction and the Internet as a venue for increasing well-being through identity play.
0	Since Putnam popularized the term, the concept of social capital has been harshly criticized by a number of scholars as being too vague and/or general to be a useful concept.  While we agree that the conceptual ambiguity surrounding social capital is problematic, we argue that social capital, like many sociological concepts such as social structure, is not just one thing and that accordingly it is undesirable to dismiss the concept out of hand merely because it does not have a single meaning.  We distill the conceptual discussions about social capital to argue that there are three componentsnetwork structure, trust and reciprocity, and resourcesthat are associated with, but vary in degree and salience for all forms of social capital.  These three components should be considered continua along which the forms of social capital can vary.  A fourth continuum is between micro and macro forms of social capital.  Locating the types of social capital along these continua opens the possibility for seemingly different types of social capital to be compared or for theories about how they may be related to each other to be tested. We draw ideas from other research traditions, in particular social networks and exchange theory, to address conceptual challenges that have been identified within the social capital literature.
1	Religious individuals commonly make sizable monetary sacrifices by contributing to their congregations. This social action resides in the overlap of religious and economic realms of behavior, creating a certain tension. Following a Weberian approach to social inquiry, I treat religious giving as social action whereby individuals direct their value-rational and instrumental-rational behavior towards others. Using data from the American Congregational Giving Survey and the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, I test hypotheses derived from a rational choice perspective, the sense of solidarity one feels, and from the religious meaning of the giver. Rational choice hypotheses produce mixed results, the solidarity impact is confirmed, and high levels of religiosity have a strong impact on giving.
1	Male sex workers serve multiple groups (i.e., gay-identified men, heterosexually-identified men, and their own sexual partners), making them a unique source to test theories of gender, masculinity, and sexuality. To date, most scholarship on this topic has been qualitative. I assembled a dataset from the largest online male sex worker website to conduct the first quantitative analysis of male escorts in the United States. I find the geographic distribution of male sex workers is more strongly correlated with the general population than with the gay male population. In addition, I estimate the value of sexual behaviors and personal characteristics in this market to test sociological theories of gender and masculinity. Consistent with hegemonic masculinity, I find that male escorts who advertise masculine behavior charge higher prices for their services, whereas escorts who advertise less masculine behavior charge significantly less, a differential on the order of 17 percent. Results show that race and sexual behavior interactions exert a strong influence on prices charged by male sex workers, confirming aspects of intersectionality theory.
0	In this paper, we explore within-family differences in mother-to-child support in later life, using data collected from 144 African American and 407 white mothers ages 65-78.  The findings indicate substantial within-family variation in mother-to-child support in both Black and white families; specifically, most mothers appeared to differentiate among their children rather than provide support to all or to none of them. Some factors found to be most important in understanding intergenerational support using between-family designs also helped to explain within-family differencesmothers were more likely to provide support to daughters, to children who were single, and to those who lived nearby.  Comparisons of models for Blacks and whites revealed more dissimilarities than similarities. Childs gender and health problems in adulthood played roles in explaining within-family differences in both Black and white families; however, effects of gender were greater among whites, whereas effects of childrens health problems were greater among Blacks.   Further, some factors that were important in explaining white mothers differentiation among her children, such as childs marital status, had no effect on Black mothers differentiation. In sum, the findings indicate that within-family differences in support to children continue across the life course in white and Black families, although the factors explaining these patterns differ somewhat by race.

Corporate leaders and corporate giving officers have designed a rationale for corporate volunteerism in the past 10 years. Corporate volunteerism is thus supposed to enhance the ability to work in a cooperative way, to soften professional hierarchies, and to add value and meaning to work. However, it appears that if corporate volunteerism has diverse and significant effects on employees working lives, some of its consequences are slightly different despite original intentions. As a matter of fact, corporate volunteerism reflects the management trends at work in French corporations, among which the will to create an affective commitment to the corporations and to blur the existing gaps and conflicts between employees and their managers, a growing space occupied by work in employees lives, and an increasing discrediting of unions. Finally, the corporate sphere is using corporate volunteerism to undermine the public sphere.
1	"Approaching the public representation of a ""difficult past"" as a macro-level impression management dilemma, this article addresses how states manage reputation-damaging elements of their histories on global stages. Through an empirical case study, I examine how the Croatian government has represented the country to international audiences via tourism after the wars of Yugoslav secession. Challenging assumptions that contentious historical moments will be commemorated, I find that the state has managed Croatia ""diflicult"" recent past through covering and cultural reframing rather than public acknowledgment. The country has omitted the war from representations of national history and repositioned Croatia as identical in history and culture to its Western European neighbors. I draw from Goffman's work on stigma to explain the Croatian case and to develop a broader theoretical framework for understanding the conditions under which public recognition of reputation-damaging events is likely not to occur I conclude by discussing theoretical implications for scholarship on collective memory, cultural sociology, and world polity theory."
1	U.S. immigration policies after 1965 fueled a rise in the Latino population and, thus, increased the competition for low-skill jobs. We examine whether Latino immigration and Latino dominance of low-skill industries increases black urban violence. Using city-level data for the year 2000, we find that (1. Latino immigration is positively linked to urban black violence, (2. the link is most prevalent where blacks lost ground to Latinos in low-skill markets, (3. not all low-skill sectors operate in unison; black violence rises only when jobs in agriculture, manufacturing and construction are in short supply and, (4. Latino immigration raises black violence by first increasing black unemployment. We discuss the implications of these findings.
1	As social and economic stratification between black and white Americans persists at the dawn of the twenty-first century, disparities in educational outcomes remain an especially formidable barrier Recent research on the black/white achievement gap points to a perplexing pattern in this regard. Schools appear to exacerbate black/white disparities in learning while simultaneously slowing the growth of social class gaps. How might this occur? Using 1st grade data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), I test-and find support for-the proposition that school factors play an elevated role in generating the black/white achievement gap while non-school factors primarily drive social class inequalities. These findings help explain why black/white achievement disparities grow mostly during the school year (when schools are in session and have their greatest impact on students' learning) while class gaps widen mostly during the summer (when school is out of session and non-school influences dominate). I conclude by discussing the implications for future research, especially as they pertain to what appears to be the most important contributor to the black/white achievement gap: school racial segregation.
1	Despite women's advancement in the workplace over the past 40 years, their representation in top-level positions remains disproportionately low relative to that of men. This raises the question of what factors drive greater gender equality in managerial ranks. Using national equal employment opportunity (EEO-1) data for the supermarket industry, this article proposes that high-profile sex discrimination lawsuit filings provide the type of intense pressure that leads to increased female managerial representation. Results from fixed-effects models demonstrate the significance of litigation in the short and long run, especially for women employed by supermarkets located in the most progressive U. S. appellate court jurisdictions. The findings also provide support for a normative effect on change based on regional variation in public orientation toward gender equality.
1	Moving to Opportunity (MTO) offered public housing residents the opportunity to move to low-poverty neighborhoods. Several years later, boys in the experimental group fared no better on measures of risk behavior than their control group counterparts, whereas girls in the experimental group engaged in lower-risk behavior than control group girls. The authors explore these differences by analyzing data from in-depth interviews conducted with 86 teens in Baltimore and Chicago. They find that daily routines, fitting in with neighborhood norms, neighborhood navigation strategies, interactions with peers, friendship making, and distance from father figures may contribute to how girls who moved via MTO benefited more than boys.
0	At the center of the debate about trends in civic engagement are concerns about whether civic life is in decline or merely changing forms and concerns about the tensions between individualism and altruism, self-interest and public interests. In this case study of a long-distance charity bike ride to benefit an AIDS service provider, I shed new light on the debate by showing how civic organizations can mediate these tensions and create a successful volunteer event that combines self-interested recreation with altruistic voluntarism. Organizers of the event used socialization, symbolism, and a culture of caring in order to remind volunteer bike riders of the connection between cycling and HIV/AIDS. The result was a highly successful event that yielded high rates of satisfaction, feelings of group cohesion and social solidarity, and new personal identification with the cause. I argue that this new form of civic engagement, called civic recreation, shows the creativity and new possibilities that organizations can take advantage of in changing conditions of civic engagement. It further shows how the tensions between self-interest and public interest are not only undermined, but also can be beneficial to civic groups.
1	Ancestor worship and bloodline continuation are the core norms of lineage in China. Beginning in the late 1970s, these cultural norms came into direct confrontation with the state birth control policy. Pitched against each other are the antinatalist laws backed by the powerful and unyielding state apparatus on the one side and the ancient pronatalist norms backed by revived lineage networks on the other. Even though the draconian state policies did succeed in dramatically reducing the overall birthrates, data analyses show that villages with strong kinship networks tend to have higher birthrates. The findings demonstrate the normative capacity of social networks to bend the iron bars of formal institutions. A general framework is developed for analyzing the roles of social networks in four ideal-typical juxtapositions of formal and informal institutions: normativism, legalism, congruence, and conflict.
1	This article uses extensive ethnographic data on the U. S. white power movement ( WPM) to describe the interactional aspects of managing activist stigma in everyday settings. We describe their stigma management as a form of everyday resistance. In the face of strong cultural codes against extreme racism, they conceal their Aryan identity to avoid the constant ire, indignation, and conflict they face from others. But, concealing their activist identity creates dissonance, which they work out by exploiting opportunities to selectively disclose features of their racist self. Disclosing aspects of their Aryan self while covering the more extreme aspects creates some expressive balance, which activists experience as resistance to social constraints on identity and self-expression that they perceive. We explain variances in the degree to which WPM members conceal and disclose their identity by focusing on structural differences in the common, everyday settings of family, work, school, and other public contexts.
1	Sociology has seen a renewed interest in the study of morality. However, a theory of the self that explains individual variation in moral behavior and emotions is noticeably absent. In this study, we use identity theory to explain this variability. According to identity theory, actors are self-regulating entities whose goal is to verify their identities. An individual's moral identity-wherever it falls on the moral-immoral continuum-guides behavior, and people experience negative emotions when identity verification does not ensue. Furthermore, the identity verification process occurs within situations that have cultural expectations-that is, framing rules and feeling rules-regarding how individuals should act and feel. These cultural expectations also influence the degree to which people behave morally. We test these assumptions on a sample of more than 350 university students. We investigate whether the moral identity and framing situations in moral terms influences behavior and feelings. Findings reveal that the identity process and framing of situations as moral are significantly associated with moral action and moral emotions of guilt and shame.
1	Conflict escalates through a series of feedback loops. On the micro level, conflict generates conditions for intense interaction rituals, and internal solidarity fuels external conflict. Perceived atrocities reciprocally increase ideological polarization between opponents, while confrontational tension/fear makes violence incompetent and produces real atrocities. Conflict groups seek allies, drive out neutrals, and mobilize material resources. Both sides in a conflict counter-escalate through the same set of feedbacks. Winning and losing are determined by differences between rates of escalation and by attacks that one-sidedly destroy organizational and material capacity. Conflict de-escalates because both sides fail to find conditions for solidarity, cannot overcome confrontational tension/fear, and exhaust their material resources. Emotional burnout sets in through a time dynamic of explosion, plateau, and dissipation of enthusiasm. Defection of allies opens the way for third-party settlement. When both sides remain stalemated, initial enthusiasm and external polarization give way to emergent internal factions-a victory faction (hard-liners) versus a peace faction (negotiators)-creating new conflict identities. Ideals promoted at the outset of conflict become obstacles to resolution at the end.
1	Despite great interest in the role of social networks as channels of political mobilization, few studies have examined which types of social networks work more effectively in recruiting political activists. Using the Citizen Participation Study data, this study shows that contrary to the conventional wisdom in the literature, there is little evidence that strong ties are more effective than weak ties in recruiting activists. Ties formed in civic associations, however, are more effective than other ties in recruiting protest participants. Neighborhood ties are more effective in recruiting community activists, but not in other types of activity. I conclude that the contents Of relationships and the identities shared by two people, rather than tie strength, form the basis of interpersonal influence in political activism.
1	To what extent did the increase in wage inequality among men in the United States over the past three decades result from job loss and/or employment instability We propose a simple method for decomposing the change in wage inequality into components due to upward and downward between-employer mobility and within-employer wage changes using data on men's wages and job mobility from the 1977-2005 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics We find that downward employer mobility a proxy for job displacement based on movement to a lower paid job with a new employer has the largest effect on inequality over a two-year period. However, the effect of job displacement declines with time. We find that the effect of job loss accounts for 39 percent of the increase in wage inequality during the average eight-year period from 1977 through 2005, compared to 52 percent that is attributable to wage changes for workers who stay with the same employer.
0	In distinction of many other stagnating sectors of the national economy, higher education in Russia has undergone a rapid development over the last two decades. Rapidly developing segments of the economy in the Post-socialist space are also known for sprawling informal economic relations. In such segments, illicit revenues may exceed legal income and political influence is considered an economic resource. This paper considers new challenges for Russian universities, including flourishing and widespread corruption, politicization and state pressure, and student activism, and hypothesizes on how these three may be linked. It argues that the widespread corruption in Russian universities may be used by the state in order to gain much needed political support of faculty and students. Informal approval of corrupt activities in colleges and universities in exchange for loyalty and compliance with the current political regime is commonplace in modern Russia. But student activism may take different trajectories of development and transform students into a major political force not by the virtue of the state pressures but by the students’ own will.
1	Some immigrants to the United States arrive to find co-ethnic communities that are highly entrepreneurial, and many members of their own group among their prospective employers. Other immigrants settle in far less entrepreneurial communities and have few if any co-ethnics among prospective employers. We assess whether co-ethnic entrepreneurship improves immigrant employees' wages. Previous research has focused on a small number of the largest ethnic groups in the largest cities. We study immigrants in 490 ethnic communities across the United States. Controlling for ethnicity. metropolitan area, and key individual- and community-level characteristics, we find effects of co-ethnic entrepreneurship on immigrant employees' wages that vary substantially with the characteristics of entrepreneurs and employees. Overall, immigrant employees earn lower hourly wages in more entrepreneurial Communities. but they earn higher wages where co-ethnic entrepreneurs are both numerous and economically successful. Low-skilled immigrant employees earn significantly less in highly entrepreneurial communities than they otherwise would. 
0	The 1980s were the high water mark of concern and public programming directed at (curbing) teen pregnancy rates, which have declined in the years since (Child Trends, 2002). This might lead one to conclude that participation in sex education programs was an effective deterrent to teenage premarital fertility. This paper simultaneously tests this idea with a competing hypothesis, that social capital has a greater effect on adolescent fertility than sex ed programs. The rationale is based on Colemans (1988) argument that social capital facilitates both the internalization and enforcement of societal norms for behavior, in this case adolescent childbearing. An important feature of social capital is what Coleman termed closure  where the people one knows also know each other. I find that certain forms of social capital  that between an adolescent and his/her parents and his/her school officials  have significant effects in lessening the odds of a teenage birth by the tenth grade, while neither parental relations with the school and its officials, nor sex ed participation, has any effect. While this runs counter to the closure hypothesis, these results strengthen social capital as an important concept for the process of teenage premarital fertility.
1	Over the past century the United States has experienced substantial population-wide gains in educational attainment - increases driven largely by processes of cohort succession Focusing on the adult population age 25-54 we show that there has been (1) a significant attenuation of the historical increases in educational attainment and (2) a shift in the processes underlying educational change that differs by gender Our analysis points to a significant turning point in population-wide educational levels, and from a research perspective has implications for how one interprets findings when using education as a control variable 
1	This article investigates how the growth in income inequality from 1970 to 2000 affected patterns of income segregation along three dimensions: the spatial segregation of poverty and affluence, race-specific patterns of income segregation, and the geographic scale of income segregation. The evidence reveals a robust relationship between income inequality and income segregation, an effect that is larger for black families than for white families. In addition, income inequality affects income segregation primarily through its effect on the large-scale spatial segregation of affluence rather than by affecting the spatial segregation of poverty or by altering small-scale patterns of income segregation.
1	Using data from 19,839 adolescents from the National Education Longitudinal Study, this study investigates whether the effects of parental divorce on adolescents' academic test performance vary by sibship size. Analyses show that the negative effect of divorce on adolescent performance attenuates as sibship size increases. On the other side of the interaction, the inverse relationship between sibship size and test performance is weaker in disrupted than in two-biological-parent families. Trends of such interactions are evident when sibship size is examined either as a continuous or a categorical measure. Finally, the observed interactions on adolescents' academic performance are completely explained by variations in parental financial, human, cultural, and social resources. In sum, this study underlines the importance of treating the effect of parental divorce as a variable and calls for more research to identify child and family features that may change the magnitude of such an effect. 
0	In Religious Rejections of the World and Their Directions, Max Weber argues that rationalization of the modern capitalist economy is at odds with an ongoing role in it for religions of salvation (Weber 1958: 331). Indeed, Weber offers the disappearance of the Catholic usury prohibition as an example of how “the needs of economic life make themselves manifest” (Weber 1978: 577&#8210;578). How, then, do we explain the birth of modern commercial Islamic finance in the 1970s and its efflorescence in the past decade into a $1 trillion global industry, precisely at a moment when international finance was undergoing dramatic technicization? How has an explicitly religious project blossomed from the soil of hyper-rationalized contemporary financial capitalism by embracing the usury ban and a role for Islam in the economy, instead of rejecting them? After an Introduction that outlines what modern Islamic finance is, this paper sets out to answer that question.  I assess the impact on Islamic finance’s development of four global-level events of the last half-century: the Cold War, the growth of Islamism, the oil shocks of the 1970s, and the expansion of international finance.  The Conclusion looks toward the future of Islamic finance.
1	"Our original article espoused a simple way to recode religious groups on the General Social Survey (GSS) into historically meaningful categories and attempted to steer social scientists away from assigning these groups to a ""Liberal-Moderate-Conservative"" scale (Smith 1990). Among other problems, such scales create arbitrary cutpoints, have little to do with the historical movements that gave rise to particular religious affiliations and tend to conflate religious, economic, social and political ideas into one monolithic measure. In contrast, we assigned Protestants to mainline, evangelical and Black Protestant categories. In 12 short years, our classificatory system (RELTRAD) has become the standard way to code GSS affiliation data and has been utilized in many other survey efforts. Since its publication, no competing classificatory schemes have emerged to replace it. This article extends our earlier work and raises a series of theoretical and methodological issues for consideration by scholars in efforts to classify religious groups for analysis purposes."
0	The establishment of workplace non-discrimination policies—or varieties of ‘fair employment’ legislation—has been a vanguard of the 20th century. Such policies, perhaps even more than other forms of economic regulation, sit at the nexus of legal and organizational logics. While notions of non-discrimination tend to emphasize understandings of equality and fairness, implementations of such policies rather tend to rely on bureaucracy and Weberian notions of rationality. As such, Dobbin (2009) finds that in the US, firm-level personnel professionals have in fact been largely responsible for the invention and evolution of equal employment and affirmative action policy in the US. This paper expands on Dobbin’s work to examine how the involvement of personnel professional in defining fair employment in two other countries—Canada and Great Britain—compares with their involvement in the US. In particular, I examine prominent HR journals in each country to map out the role personnel professionals play in the organizational field of fair employment regulation within each country.
1	We report on an experiment that utilizes an application-files design to recreate several features of a hiring decision for junior-engineer positions. The critical situation under study involved an assessor (either male or female) and a male and a female candidate with highly similar professional qualifications but different self-presentation styles. We investigate effects from sex category of assessor, sex category and self-presentation of pair of candidates, and type of assessment decision (namely, choice between the two applicants, and ratings of their competence and suitability). Our hypotheses consider both gender as status and as social identity, and predict different outcomes depending on assessment decision. We found no evidence of bias against the female applicant. The question about competence elicited effects from self-presentation only, from both men and women; the choice of applicant and suitability measures show no bias against the female candidate by men and a bias in her favor by women.

Concentrating on issues of organizational belonging, this paper will discuss ""lone girls"" in Israels Defence Forces, that is, women serving in bases where the majority of soldiers are men.  While lone girls benefit from their army experiences on an individual level, their presence on male-dominated bases does little to strengthen the position of women in Israeli society and in the IDF.  Drawing on Kanters discussion of tokens, it is argued that lone girls are subject to a great deal of special attention and differential treatment.  Token women in the IDF are often used as surrogate families for male soldiers, as sexual objects and as social workers.  The paper closes with a discussion of why lone girls are pushed into traditional gender roles and positions and, furthermore, why they find acting out traditional sex-roles empowering."
0	This article reviews the literature addressing the rise of reparations since the Second World War. Finding that the main positions in the field ignore the possibility that reparations represent an effort to effect a transformation of the collective identities of the groups offering them, the article explores this possibility via a group of scholars working on the issue of cultural trauma from within the ‘strong program’ of cultural analysis. By combining Bernd Giesen’s theory of the ‘trauma of the perpetrators’ with Jeffrey Alexander’s analysis of the transformation of the meaning of the Holocaust, the article suggests that reparations represent an attempt to rehabilitate collective identity.
1	This article introduces a network model that pictures occupants of robust positions as recipients of diversified support from durably located others and portrays occupants of fragile positions as dependents on tenuously situated others. The model extends Herfindahl's index of concentration by bringing in the recursiveness of Bonacich's method. Using Newcomb's study of a college fraternity, we find empirical support for the contention that fragility reduces future growth in status. Applications of the model to input-output networks among industries in the U.S. economy and to hiring networks among academic departments are also presented. Implications for future research are discussed.
0	The paper reports on an on-going research project studying the lives and experiences of professional European citizens who have chosen to live and work outside their country of origin within other member states of the EU. These prototypical free movers are at the heart of the EUs ideal conception of economic integration, and carry with them the hopes of a genuine transnational free market in labour. Focusing in on the experiences of such free movers in Brussels, the study reports on the everyday realities of these life choices, reconstructing the everyday barriers and opportunities they face in terms of employment, welfare, housing, education for children, political participation and cultural involvement in the life of the city. The question offers a crucial empirical test of the overblown macro-sociological rhetoric about global cities, globalization and international elites, showing how and why, for even these most mobile and privileged of movers, escaping the dominant national organisation of life, family and career in Europe is still a rarity and exception. This may go some way to explaining Europes remarkably low rates of internal migration, figures that have not risen despite over 40 years of European integration and free movement accords.
0	From the ecological model of the Chicago School to contemporary theories, sociologists have argued that the city wields a powerful force which constrains agency, both at the individual level and further at the level of community, whereby their adaptation to the urban environment might produce a culture unique to their ecological niche in the city.  This paper critiques urban sociologys primary explanations for concentrated disadvantage in American cities, focusing particularly on articulations of a culture of poverty as an explanatory theory.   Bridging divides within the discipline of sociology, we find that the work of human ecologists, globalization theorists, political economists, demographers, and ethnographers reveal the relevance and intangibility of a cultural explanation for concentrated disadvantage in American cities, one that warrants a reevaluation of policy, community-building, and agency in our most disadvantaged communities.
1	Using two population-based surveys we provide the first test of longitudinal age variations in Ryff's model of psychological well-being (RPWB) across three midlife to later-life transitions Through these analyses we explore (a) age variation in RPWB (b) the structure of RPWB and (c) the potential for methodologically driven age patterns In general, RPWB dimensions do not consistently exhibit distinct age profiles further longitudinal age variations are exceptionally small never accounting for more than 4% of the variance We observe far greater variation within ages or periods than between subscales across age or time - providing strong evidence against substantively different age profiles of RPWB Moreover heterogeneity among positively and negatively worded items yield varied age patterns indicating that the small age variations of RWPB could be driven at least in part by methodological artifacts rather than maturation 
1	This article explores the organizational conditions under which discrimination charges occur. Drawing on structural and organizational theories of the workplace, the authors demonstrate how organizational conditions affect workers' and regulatory agents' understandings of unlawful discrimination. Using a national sample of work establishments, matched to discrimination-charge data obtained from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the authors examine how characteristics of the workplace and institutional environment affect variation in the incidence of workers' charges of sex and race discrimination and in the subset of discrimination claims that are verified by EEOC investigators. The findings indicate that workplace conditions, including size, composition, and minority management, affect workers' charges as well as verified claims; the latter are also affected by institutional factors, such as affirmative action requirements, subsidiary status, and industrial sector. These results suggest that internal workplace conditions affect both workers' and regulatory agents' interpretations of potentially discriminatory experiences, while institutional conditions matter only for regulatory agents' interpretations of those events.
0	The literature on emerging credit card markets suggests that without requisite institutions such as credit bureaus, credit rating agencies, laws, etc., credit card issuing decisions are likely to be based upon trust  trust in ones network of friends and/or the networks of trusted others  rather than rational calculation (credit scoring). This does not seem to be the case in China (or other Asian countries for that matter), and the existing literature does not provide compelling explanations for how banks are incorporating calculative methods in their practice of issuing cards. The goals of this paper are therefore twofold: The first is to describe the current state of the credit card market in China, including the types of cards available, scope of usage, institutional support, as well as the social, economic and political environment influencing the credit card market in attempt to understand how credit-issuing decisions are made. The second goal of the paper is to outline a framework for understanding the actual practices of credit card decision making.
1	How the growing Latino population fits into the U.S. racial structure is a subject of considerable debate. Are Latinos developing into a separate racial group, becoming part of the dominant group, or creating a panminority group with nonwhites? Extending beyond existing research that uses intermarriage or survey data to assess racial boundaries, this study examines Latinos' stated racial preferences for dates among a sample of over 4,000 Internet daters in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Atlanta. We find that few Latinos prefer to only date other Latinos. Latinos are much more likely to prefer to date whites than blacks, and are much more likely than blacks to prefer whites, suggesting that the Latino-white boundary is less rigid than Latino-black or black-white boundaries. However, Latinos are also much more likely to prefer blacks than whites are. Further analyses highlight differences in racial preferences among Latinos by metropolitan.area, educational level, language, and religion. Greater proximity to blacks in New York and Atlanta promotes greater acceptance. In these locales, we see some indications of a panminority group of blacks and a small set of Latinos developing. While the majority of Latinos accept racial hierarchies that privilege whiles, providing evidence that many are assimilating into the dominant group, assimilation patterns vary for different segments of the diverse Latino population.
1	Work-family conflicts are common and consequential for employees, their families, and work organizations. Can workplaces be changed to reduce work-family conflict? Previous research has not been able to assess whether workplace policies or initiatives succeed in reducing work-family conflict or increasing work-family fit. Using longitudinal data collected from 608 employees of a white-collar organization before and after a workplace initiative was implemented, we investigate whether the initiative affects work-family conflict and fit, whether schedule control mediates these effects, and whether work demands, including long hours, moderate the initiative's effects on work-family outcomes. Analyses clearly demonstrate that the workplace initiative positively affects the work-family interface, primarily by increasing employees' schedule control. This study points to the importance of schedule control for our understanding of job quality and for management policies and practices.
1	This paper uses American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data to describe the time use of teenagers ages 15-17, with a focus on activities that may affect teenagers' well-being such as sleep, eating, schoolwork, and selected leisure activities. We find that teenagers with an employed mother spend less time on homework and computers, are less likely to eat with parents, but spend more time in supervised activities. Teenagers with a single mother spend more time in paid work, are less likely to eat dinner with their parent, and spend more time in unsupervised activities, but they also get more sleep. Adolescents with more educated mothers spend more time studying and on the computer, less time watching television, and are more likely to eat dinner with parents. Family income correlates positively with teenagers' paid work, homework, computer use, and the likelihood of eating with parents, but is negatively associated with sleep. Family size is positively related to time spent in caregiving activities, sleep, and eating with parents, but is associated with less computer use. 
0	Though a few researchers have begun to examine state level LTCOPs; less is known regarding the effectiveness of local LTCOPs. This investigation seeks to reaffirm and extend previous findings concerning LTCOPs while also exploring additional topic areas which have yet to be systematically investigated. The proposed poster will be based on responses from data collected from local LTCOPs in New York and California, states that rank first and second in people aged 85 and over in the US. Data will be collected through telephone interview surveys with ombudsman participants from 51 programs in New York and 35 in California (representing 100 percent of the local LTCOPs in each state). Finally, approval has been granted to obtain access to the National Ombudsman Reporting System (NORS) data from New York State and California for 2003. The NORS data will be utilized to triangulate secondary data with the primary survey data. Systematic analyses will be focused on domain areas including: (1) adequacy and control over resources, (2) organizational autonomy, and (3) inter-organizational relationships.  Supplemental analyses will focus on barriers and perceived effectiveness in the role of local ombudsmen in the following specific domain areas: post-acute care and rehabilitation services, elder abuse, end-of-life care, and cultural competence. With the recognition of rapidly increasing numbers of individuals who will be residing in nursing homes and residential care facilities for long-term care services, improved knowledge related to local LTCOPs is timely and represents an important issue for professionals, policy makers as well as residents and their families.
1	Prior research has increasingly shown that the length of time in the U.S. and acculturation may have negative effects on a variety of immigrant outcomes, including academic performance, health, and occupational attainment. However, much of the research on the educational outcomes of immigrants focuses primarily on their academic achievement but neglects another factor that affects educational success-behavior at school. Using data from a sample of high school seniors in several Pacific Northwest school districts. I examine whether more time in the U.S. increases school misbehavior by testing the effects of immigrant generation and indicators of acculturation on three measures of disciplinary problems during the senior year of high school-attending class unprepared, getting in trouble for breaking school rules, and being put on suspension. First and one-point-five generation immigrants attend class more prepared and get into less trouble for breaking the school rules than do third or higher generation students during their senior year of high school. High academic performance and indicators of acculturation explain only part of this beneficial effect of immigrant generation on behavior at school. Additional analyses show that second generation Asian immigrants are more similar to first and 1.5 generation immigrants from all racial and ethnic groups than they are from other second generation racial and ethnic groups in regards to moderate and intermediate behavior. 
1	Sociologists have given considerable attention to identifying the neighborhood-level social-interactional mechanisms that influence outcomes such as crime, educational attainment, and health. Yet, cultural mechanisms are often overlooked in quantitative studies of neighborhood effects. This paper adds a cultural dimension to neighborhood effects research by exploring the consequences of legal cynicism. Legal cynicism refers to a cultural frame in which people perceive the law as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety. The authors find that legal cynicism explains why homicide persisted in certain Chicago neighborhoods during the 1990s despite declines in poverty and declines in violence city-wide.
0	Arts and culture are powerful tools in the economic and cultural development of public spaces.  Numerous economic impact studies have shown that the arts can have a strong positive influence on the development and revitalization of downtown areas, as well as contributing to the tax revenue base, the public image of an area and the business and cultural diversity in a community.  Consequently, an economic impact evaluation is an important tool for highlighting the continued success and positive effects of the arts in any given area.  This study represents information from 34 cultural organizations located in Duval County, Florida.  The results were collected from March 2003 through July 2003 and represent each organizations most recently completed fiscal year
1	This article examines the effects of market specialization on economic and social outcomes. Integrating two perspectives, we explore why products that span multiple categories suffer social and economic disadvantages. According to the audience-side perspective, audience members refer to established categories to make sense of products. Products that incorporate features from multiple categories are perceived to be pool fits Mill category expectations and less appealing than category specialists. The producer-side view holds that spanning categories reduces one ability to effectively target each category's audience, which decreases appeal to audience members. Rather than treating these as rival explanations, A,e propose that both processes matter and offer a systematic, integrated account of how penalties arise as a consequence of audience-side and producer side processes. We analyze data from two dissimilar contexts, eBay auctions and U.S. future-film projects, to test the central implications of our theory Together these tests provide support for our integrated approach and suggest that both processes contribute to the penalties associated with category spanning.
1	This study examines how interpersonal recruitment affects participation in demanding forms of political activity. Previous studies have argued that interpersonal recruitment causally affects participation. However, recruitment attempts are selectively targeted toward people with high participation potential. This implies that interpersonal recruitment may work simply because recruiters ask the people who would participate anyway. Using propensity score matching, I show that interpersonal recruitment has larger effects on non-electoral forms of participation than electoral ones such as campaign volunteer activity. I find little evidence that personal contact increases campaign donation. I also demonstrate that the effect of recruitment is not constant across individuals but varies by the propensity of being a recruitment target. ironically, people who have less chance of receiving requests are more likely to be affected. I discuss the implications of these findings for declining and increasingly unequal political participation. 
1	Attributions of panic are almost exclusively directed at members of the general public. Here, we inquire into the relationships between elites and panic. We review current research and theorizing about panic, including problems of identifying when it has occurred. We propose three relationships: elites fearing panic, elites causing panic and elites panicking. We use numerous examples, including our own research on the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, to illustrate how these relationships operate. The argument is evocative, not definitive. However, the conceptual utility of explicitly theorizing the relationships between elites and panic shows, among other things, how power works in disasters.
0	There are two main lines of conceptions of social capital  individual level and group level social capital. Questions have been raised by individual level social scholars concerning the validity of group level social capital. Burt (1992) replies to the challenge by advocating that individual social capital aggregates into group level social capital. This paper moves beyond simple summation of lower level capital and presents a game theoretical model through which micro to macro production of social capital is accomplished. The paper also addresses the debate on social ties vs. social resource in the social capital literature. By explicitly modeling differential distribution of resources, the proposed model also redirects theoretical attention to hierarchical social structures that are prevalent in reality.
0	Abstract: Collective identity refers to the constructed and negotiated sense of we-ness and shared understanding that makes collective action possible.  The boundaries of a collective identity are rendered particularly visible as new actors or organizations attempt to enter a social movement.  How do new organizations negotiate these boundaries?  Relying on in-depth, open-ended interviews, we use the vantage point of two organizationsan organization of men, and an organization of middle-class, professional womento explore how new organizations, whose membership and tactics mark them as different, negotiate their way through the collective boundaries of the violence against women movement in Toronto, Canada.  In so doing, we explore how gender and class influence the steps taken by these organizations in their quest to be recognized by those organizations at the movements core.  We emphasize the dual and overlapping role of structure (primarily resources) and culture (the ideological framing around the movement) in shaping how organizations negotiate the collective identity boundaries.  We conclude with a discussion of how the collective identity of the Toronto violence against women movement is transformed as a result of these negotiations, and how the inclusion of these two organizations moves the movement further from its original radical feminist roots.
0	Neo-orientalist images of Muslim women throwing off the veil to assert leadership ignore the contexts of its emergence. From the sixteenth century when the first Muslims were brought to America from Africa in chains to the present, leadership emerged from its followership which, in turn is shaped by social structure. The author uses intersectionality theory to explore two questions: How did intersections of nation, home, citizenship, and state impact the followership and its expectations of Muslim women’s leadership?  What was the leadership model of each period, and what were its strategies? Findings reveal that even as structures of nation, citizenship, and state changed over time, in the United States, Muslim women’s leadership has always emerged from a globalized context.  Each historic period created its own leadership model and strategies.  The spiritual guide leadership model of the early enslaved communities depended on spiritual resilience, as strategy to resist slavery. The scholar activist model developed in the 1970s, to overcome the compound oppressions of Western liberal feminists and patriarchal Islamicists. In conclusion, this paper suggests that that an intersectional leadership model based on the praxis of intersectional agency is needed to confront the negative globalized landscapes of the post 9/11 era.
0	Defining culture as the tools, resources, and repertoires for strategic action (Swidler 1986; Bourdieu 1990; Sewell 1992, Tilly 1993; Hays 1994) implies an active self geared toward problem solving.  Framing actors as strategizers implies goal directed behavior, but such theories of culture do not specify what these goals might be.  What ends are we strategizing towards, what are the dynamics of these strategizing selves, and how do these selves use culture?  In order to answer the above questions about how we use culture and what we are strategizing to achieve, we need to understand the basic motives for behavior.  The goal of this paper is to establish a process of the self that is built on this interaction between basic motives and our environment.  As selves, we use cultural tools and help to create new ones through strategizing to reach our innate goals as well as the socially constructed ones that are scaffolded on top of these.
1	We examine how the relationship between development and inequality at the societal level is perceived and evaluated by ordinary Chinese people. We hypothesize that because the Chinese have recently experienced rapid increases in both economic growth and social inequality, they tend to view economic development as a driving force of social inequality. To address this question, we conducted a social survey in 2006 in six Chinese provinces (n = 4898). The survey data reveal that a large proportion of Chinese people have internalized a causal model in which they project high levels of inequality onto countries they view as more developed and low levels of inequality onto countries they see as less developed. However, results also show that a smaller proportion of Chinese believe in a negative relationship between development and inequality. Hence, the study reveals heterogeneity among ordinary Chinese in their perceptions of the causal relationship between development and inequality. Surprisingly, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics provide no explanatory power in explaining this heterogeneity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	There is a rich collection of case studies examining the relationship between democratization, women movements, and gendered state outcomes, but the variation across cases is still poorly understood. In response, this article develops a theoretically-grounded comparative framework to evaluate and explain cross-national variations in the gendered outcomes of democratic transitions. The framework highlightsfour theoretical factors-the context of the transition, the legacy of women previous mobilizations, political parties, and international influences-that together shape the political openings and ideologies available to women movements in transitional states. Applying the framework to four test cases, we conclude that women movements are most effective at targeting democratizing states when transitions are complete, when women movements develop cohesive coalitions, when the ideology behind the transition (rather than the ideology of the winning regime) aligns easily with feminist frames, and when women past activism legitimates present-day feminist demands. These findings challenge current conceptualizations of how democratic transitions affect gender in state institutions and provide a comparative framework for evaluating variation across additional cases.
0	This study addresses the experience of US veterans who work and receive therapy at the Veterans Garden at West Los Angeles VA. Based on in-depth interviews with veterans and observation in public events, the study shows how multiple roles and statuses of veterans are situated in interactions with institutions and people in their environment. While interacting with strangers who visit the garden as well as bureaucrats from the VA, veterans usually perform the role of national hero, implying posttraumatic disorders as the reason for their current situation. However, within their peer-group, themes of poverty, substance abuse, and efforts to get better treatment and higher compensation are more common. I use the concept of Biological Citizenship, developed over the last decade, in order to theoretically frame these experiences of veterans. This term, connoting the relationship between bodily conditions, national systems of responsibility, and citizenship, is then specified in two ways.  First, citizenship is enacted through the structure of allocation of resources to individuals through systems of clinical and administrative classification. Second, the situational nature biological citizenship, where social roles and statuses change through interactions, is brought to the fore.
0	In this paper I explore how aging and discourses of aging influence how immigrants forge livelihoods in transnational contexts and how they contribute to and shape belonging.   I explore these themes through a close examination of the experiences of a group of Dominican immigrants.  This case study is exploratory and it may be seen as a foundation for further investigations of these themes based on more systematic data collection from a range of national origin groups
0	Reputations matter. They affect how others treat us: with deference, contempt, or indifference, for instance. And how they treat our families, allies, and others identified with us. Our reputations directly affect our own well-being, through our self-esteem, but also indirectly our ability to pursue practical goals and projects in the world around us. Our capacity to cooperate or compete is affected by what others think of us. Sociologists have long put reputational accomplishments, such as status and prestige, at the top of their list of concerns, but they have paid less attention to their use as means. This is particuluraly true in studies of social movements. Contentious politics is in no small part a strategic struggle over reputation. In this paper, we theorize why reputational struggles matter and illustrate our point by giving an account of the battle over reputations that swirled around the antislavery movement in the years leading up the American Civil War.
1	Using data on young English learners (EL) who enroll in the New York City public school system, I examine how long it takes students to become minimally proficient in English and how the time to proficiency differs for students by their age of school entry. Specifically, I follow four recent entry cohorts of ELs ages 5-10 and use discrete-time survival analysis to model the rate at which different age groups acquire proficiency. I find that approximately half of the students become proficient within three years after school entry and that younger students learn more quickly than older students. Age of entry differences are robust to controls for observed differences between age of entry groups in their economic and demographic characteristics, their disabilities, and the schools they attend. The results lend support to the theory that older students face developmental barriers to learning new languages quickly. 
0	This paper primarily investigates the associations between the change of social network and mortality by employing the nationally representative longitudinal data, Americans Changing Lives.  The sample contains 2,694 respondents aged 25  95 at the time of the first interview in 1986. In survival analyses for death that were led by all causes, social network is operationalized as having two dimensions: social integration and family support. Binomial logistic regression models are estimated to estimate the relationships.  I found that the change of social network, i.e. the increase or decrease of social network involvement between 1986 and 1989, have strong associations with mortality in 1994, independent of socio-demographic, and health status variables. The results show that the chance of dying in 1994 is more associated with the change of social network (1986  1989) than the magnitude social network that was measure in 1986, adjusting for socio-demographic and health status variables.
0	This paper explores issues at the intersection of exchange network theories, collective action theories, and theories of legitimacy.  Exchange network theory shows how network structures create power inequalities and conflicts of interest between low and high power actors.  Theories of collective action imply that power inequalities motivate low-power actors to take actions to countervail power.  Recent research identifies conditions under which low power actors form coalitions that countervail power.  The current research tests ideas from legitimacy theories.  Legitimacy theories imply that coalitions are more likely to form and that power is more likely to be countervailed if the strategy of coalition formation is legitimized.  Data from bargaining and exchanges in two strong power networks support legitimacy theory.
1	In studies of mass ideology, it is often found that political values are ordered two-dimensionally among the public at large. In a first economic dimension, equality is contested; in a second cultural one, individual freedom is contested. While this general rule of two-dimensionality applies to the public at large, there are large differences between educational categories. While two-dimensionality is found for the lower educated, the higher educated order their values along a single dimension and hence show more value coherence. Using a recent Dutch national survey, we show that these differences between the higher and the lower educated cannot be explained by differences in political competence. Instead, a combination Of cultural and economic insecurity is responsible for the lower levels of value coherence among the lower educated.
0	Although research has documented that earnings inequality within organizations affects many dimensions of organizational outcomes, we have little knowledge about what makes some organizations more unequal than others in terms of the earnings distribution. In order to study the relationship between organizational characteristics and within-organization earnings inequality, I analyze a nationally representative sample of more than 1,000 manufacturing establishments in the National Employer Survey (NES). This paper focuses on three aspects of organizational characteristics: (1) labor force composition within the organization, (2) use of computer technology at work, and (3) flexible workplace practices such as job rotation and self-managed teams. The analysis suggests that gender heterogeneity, percentage of newly hired workers within the organization, and flexible workplace practices are significantly associated with greater earnings dispersion within establishments. Contrary to the prediction of the skill-biased technological change hypothesis or the deskilling hypothesis, use of computers at work was not significantly associated with earnings inequality within establishments.
0	The secularization thesis in sociological studies of religion has been the subject of significant controversy in recent decades.  Critics point to the increasing salience of religion in the daily lives of billions of believers and the resurgence of religion in political spheres through movements and revolutions as evidence that religion has not disappeared.  Secularization theory in these critiques is likened more to a mythology of modernization embedded in the normative dreams of sociology at its founding and carried intact as dogma until courageous social scientists dared question it.  Some of this criticism is deserved, but few of these criticisms address the core argument in secularization theory – that of institutional differentiation.  Further, much of the criticism relies myopically on the single national case of the exceptional United States, or at best relies on cross-national comparison.  For the most part, these critiques cite individual level patterns of the stability or growth of religious belief and practice.  Few studies address the question of the transnational dimensions of religion in global civil society against the backdrop of the core argument of secularization as institutional differentiation.  This study utilizes new evidence on international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) to argue that secularization as institutional differentiation has been operating strongly in global civil society since the mid 19th century.
0	In his primary work, Culture&#8217;s Consequences, Geert Hofstede (1980) claims that culture influences national development along five dimensions: Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, Individualism-Collectivism, Masculinity-Femininity, and Long-Term Orientation. A wide range of research has been conducted to validate the existence of cultural differences along the lines of his original findings  (Nasierowski and Mikula, 1998; Offermann and Hellmann, 1997; Scramm-Nielsen, 2000; van Oudenhoven, 2001).  Yet most of this work, including Hofstede&#8217;s, has been conducted without examining the reliability of the measurement indices.  We developed an Uncertainty Avoidance Index based on Hofstede&#8217;s model, and found that the individual items lacked sufficient internal consistency to be considered an adequate measure.
1	Wage inequality has increased dramatically in the United States since the 1980s. This article investigates the relationship between this trend and occupational structure measured at the three-digit level. Using the Current Population Survey from 1983 to 2002, we find that the direct association between occupations and wage inequality declined over this period as within-occupational inequality grew faster than between occupational inequality. We estimate multilevel growth models using detailed occupational categories as the unit of analysis to assess how the characteristics Of occupations affect changes in mean wages and levels of wage inequality across this time period. The results indicate that changes in mean wages across occupations vary depending on the characteristics of individuals in those occupations and that intraoccupational inequality is difficult to predict using conventional labor force data. These findings seem largely inconsistent with the common sociological view of occupation as the most fundamental feature of the labor market. Correspondingly, a more comprehensive approach-one that incorporates the effects of organizational variables and market proeesses on rising wage inequality in the New Economy-is warranted.
1	This paper introduces the concept of educational utilization as an overlooked part of the education-to-work transition and a potential mechanism by which occupational sex segregation is generated among the college-educated labor force. The paper begins with a critical discussion of the operationalization approaches that have been used in prior research that implicitly measures educational utilization. Multiple empirical measure of the concept are then developed using data from the O(*)NET and the National Surveys of College Graduates. The explanatory power of each measure is assessed using conditional logit models of occupational attainment. A combined measure is then used to assess sex differences in educational utilization using data from the 1993 and 2003 National Surveys of College Graduates for 2 cohorts of college graduates-those who earned their baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate degrees and entered the labor market in the years 1985-1993 and 1995-2003. The analysis identifies sex differences in educational utilization that vary across field, degree level and cohort and concludes with an examination of the implications of sex differences in educational utilization for occupational segregation. 
0	Second generation Palestinian-Americans like many other immigrants face the dilemma of a possessing a dual allegiance to their parents' country of origin and their own place of birth. However, unlike most other immigrants this relationship is often-times contentious and not easily resolvable. Based on ethnographic research begun in 2001, this paper argues that Palestinian-Americans use the discourse of citizenship to overcome this hurdle. They use citizenship to differentiate between being Palestinian and American without renouncing their claims to either identity.
1	Homophily, the tendency for similar individuals to associate, is one of the most robust findings in social science. Despite this robustness, we have less information about how personal characteristics relate to differences in the strength of homophily. Nor do we know much about the impact of personal characteristics on judgments of relative dissimilarity. The present study compares the strength of age, religious, and educational homophily for male and female non-kin ties using network data from the 1985 General Social Survey. It also compares the patterning of ties among dissimilar alters for both sexes. The results of this exploratory effort indicate that males and females are almost equally homophilous, although religious homophily exerts a stronger influence on females than males. Males and females do, however, differ in their tendency to associate with certain types of dissimilar alters. Education is essentially uniform for both sexes, religious difference is more important for females than males, and those over sixty or under thirty are less different from the middle categories of age for females than for males. The results suggest that males are able to bridge larger areas of social space in their non-kin interpersonal networks and likely accumulate greater social capital as a consequence.

1	Relatively few studies examine the relationship between racial residential segregation and educational or cognitive outcomes. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the institutional resources model of neighborhood effects, I investigate one account of how macrostructural arrangements between race, neighborhood segregation, and school quality interact to produce inequalities in test scores. Consistent with the institutional resources model, results suggest that school quality varies across neighborhoods based, in part, on their degree of racial concentration. Indeed, school quality and other school characteristics mediate the relationship between racial concentration and verbal skills, particularly among black males. These findings have implications not only for inequalities in cognitive skills among blacks across residential space, but also between blacks and whites given high levels of residential segregation in the United States. In sum, findings illustrate yet another way in which residential segregation contributes to, and not merely reflects, racial inequalities. 
1	Research shows that those with greater social capital enjoy better physical and mental health. The current study illuminates a paradox of social capital which may afflict those involved in traumatic events. Several years of survey data reveal a dynamic picture of the link between social capital and stress following Hurricane Katrina. Results reveal that initially after Katrina, those who were more socially embedded carried the greatest load with respect to helping the displaced population, thus experiencing more stress. But over time, the most socially-involved then snapped back from their stressful experiences more rapidly than isolates. This confirms that over the course of stressful events, social involvement first exposes people to more stress, but as time passes, provides them a significant buffer against negative psychosocial experiences. 
1	This article examines letters to the editor as one of the ways citizens seek to enact a public sphere using technological mediation. Using a sample of all letters received by a metropolitan newspaper during a three-month period (N = 1,113), the authors demonstrate that the tone and argumentative styles of letters differ with the scope of the issues the letters address. Local issues evoke more reasoned, conciliatory tones, while issues beyond the local context evoke more emotional, confrontational tones, even after controlling for individual writers' characteristics and anger as a motivation to write.
1	Drawing hypotheses from resource mobilization and resource partitioning theories (RMT and RPT), this article examines how interorganizational competition and social movement industry (SMI) concentration affect the level of tactical and goal specialization of protest organizations associated with the peace, women's, and environmental movements. Additionally, the article examines how specialization affects the survival of these organizations. By and large, the findings are commensurate with the expectations of RMT and RPT. Results indicate that interorganizational competition leads to more specialized tactical and goal repertoires. Concentration in the SMI also leads to specialization, but this is only true for less established organizations. Results also indicate that tactical and goal specialization decrease organizational survival, unless the industry is highly concentrated.
0	In this research, I apply and extend Handels (2005) Post and Neo-Fordist framework for understanding job characteristics and job satisfaction in context of a changing global environment.  Prior research has indicated that the nature of work has changed dramatically in recent years in response to economic shifts and an increasingly global economy.  However, there is little agreement on whether the overall quality of work has improved or declined over that period. Furthermore, even less is known about the overall comparative quality of work and job satisfaction across the global economy.  In this study I use non-panel longitudinal data from the International Social Survey Program (Work Orientations I and II: 1989 and 1998) to conduct a comparative analysis of job quality and job satisfaction in relation to the differing theoretical predictions of Post-Fordist and Neo-Fordist paradigms and a changing global economy.
1	This paper develops and evaluates a new model for predicting just rewards. The model produces point predictions for individual just rewards based on status characteristics and the expected value of a valued good. The equity model borrows from Berger and colleagues' (1998) reward expectations theory the ability to define different reward expectations. Drawing from Melamed and Walker's (2010) recent generalization of the mathematics of reward expectations theory, I illustrate how the model generates a continuous distribution of just rewards. The general model is applied to data from thirteen countries using the International Social Justice Project. The results illustrate the predictive power of the model using data from over 10,000 respondents. Implications and future directions are discussed. 
1	Using data from the German social insurance system immigrant employment in organizational buffer zones will be investigated from an organizational ecology perspective. Theories in organization and labor market research predict higher exit rates of employees holding jobs in buffer zones. These buffer zones protect organizations from unfavorable environmental turbulences. Consequently, analyzing the impact of buffer zone employment on job stability of immigrants requires a fully dynamic approach, which goes beyond a mere identification of generally increased turnover rates of immigrants.
1	"Faced with high uncertainty how do producers in the cultural economy make creative decisions? We present a case study of the fashion modeling industry. Using participant observation, interviews and network analysis of the Spring/Summer 2007 Fashion Week collecdons, we explain how producers select models for fashion shows. While fashion producers conceive of their selection of models as a matter of ""taste,"" or personal preference, we find that their decisions are shaped by information sharing mechanism,,; in social networks, principally through a mechanism known as ""optioning,"" which enables producers to know each others' preferences and to align themselves with similar status actors. For cultural producers, choices are a matter of strategic status considerations, even as they are expressed as a matter of personal taste."
1	Gender differences in mathematics achievement have important implications for the underrepresentation of women in science. Typically, gender differences in mathematics achievement are thought to emerge at the end of middle school and beginning of high school, yet some studies find differences among younger children. This paper utilizes data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 to analyze differences in a nationally representative sample of kindergartners as they progress from kindergarten to fifth grade. Using quantile regression models to examine gender differences across the distribution, differences are found among students as early as kindergarten. Initially boys are found to do better at the top of the distribution and worse at the bottom, but by third grade boys do as well or better than girls throughout the distribution. The male advantage at the top of the distribution among entering kindergartners is largest among families with high parental education, suggesting that gender dynamics in middle and upper class families have important implications for continuing gender segregation in science occupations. Gender differences for entering kindergartners also vary across race, with Asians exhibiting the largest male advantage at the top of the distribution. In contrast to the overall pattern, among Latino kindergartners girls have an advantage over boys at the top of the distribution. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	"Social scientists have become increasingly interested in the racial identification choices of multiracial individuals, partly as a result of the federal government's new ""check all that apply"" method of racial identification. However, the majority of work to date has narrowly defined the population of multiracial individuals as the ""biracial"" children of single-race parents. In this article, we use the open-ended ancestry questions on the 1990 and 2000 5% samples of the US Census to identify a multiracial population that is potentially broader in its understanding of multiraciality. Relative to other studies, we find stronger historical continuity in the patterns of hypodescent and hyperdescent for part-black and part-American Indian ancestry individuals respectively, while we find that multiple-race identification is the modal category for those of part-Asian ancestry. We interpret this as evidence of a new, more flexible classification regime for groups rooted in more recent immigration. Our results suggest that future work on multiracial identification must pay closer attention to the varied histories of specific multiracial ancestry groups. "
0	Legislation regulating the amelioration of pain has moved across many states, in part as a result of the efforts of a series of pain patient advocacy organizations.  This work is an analysis of the spread of such efforts to pain management regulation using event history analysis, combined with network analysis and a discourse analysis of the variations in specific legislative responses.  Issues uncovered to date include the intersection of pain management with the control of drugs (and physicians), the veracity of pain complaints, and the production of discursive subjects.  International organizations have also adopted much of the language of pain amelioration, framing it in a specific rights discourse.
0	In the United States, education is widely thought of as the great equalizer (Mann 1891), functioning to improve economic and social status.  Sociological literature, however, indicates that family background is a stronger predictor of student achievement than are schools themselves. In many cases, low socioeconomic status students have a disadvantage that cannot be overcome by schools. This research considers how family socioeconomic status, school factors, and structural characteristics of nations interact in order to produce educational stratification.   It argues that the social organization and governmental policies of nations create mechanisms by which socioeconomic status influences student learning. These mechanisms create circumstances whereby socioeconomically advantaged individuals are able to obtain greater benefits from schooling than their socioeconomically disadvantaged peers.  Moreover, the dissertation argues that since national social organization and government policy varies, the effects of socioeconomic status on learning also vary on a cross-national basis.  The dissertation examines cross-national variation of several factors that may affect the relationship between socioeconomic status and learning, including residential and class segregation, curricular practices, governmental policies related directly to schooling, and programs which attack poverty and health problems. Using data on thirty-two nations from the 2000 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the World Bank, it employs hierarchical linear models (HLM) to explore how structural characteristics of nations interact with individual variables that influence student learning.  Understanding the different ways in which learning is influenced by these macro-level variables will advance the objective of equal educational opportunities for all students.
1	"We investigate how participants in the street economy of crack cocaine construct a ""hustler"" identity by contrasting their social behaviors and styles with a dialectically contrastive crackhead identity. For those who are proximate to, or involved in, the crack cocaine economy, effort is required to avoid being labeled a crackhead. Would-be hustlers construct boundaries that separate them from others on the street through talk and behavior. We draw on interviews conducted with 28 men convicted of committing violent street crimes to explore how they distance themselves from those exhibiting distasteful symptoms of crack addiction. By examining the boundaries between these two street-based identities we increase sociological understanding of the significance of offenders' identity work for shaping their conceptions of self and other, as well as their interactions in everyday street life."
0	The rise of anti-Americanism and anti-American protests in U.S. allies has led to active scholarly discussions on their possible causes. Research on U.S.-Korea relations has suggested theoretical linkages between the Bush-era diplomatic conflicts, anti-Americanism, and anti-American protests. That is, anti-American protests directly resulted from anti-Americanism as a response to policy fissures between the United States and Korea especially during the Bush administration. This article critiques this perspective and empirically analyzes the past patterns of anti-Americanism and anti-American protests, revealing that anti-American protests occurred despite a generally pro-American atmosphere in 2008. In order to investigate the causes of anti-U.S. beef protests in 2008, this article draws from social movement perspectives and further explores the structural conditions that shape anti-American protests. Findings based on negative binomial regression emphasize the importance of political and discursive opportunity structures for anti-American protests to develop as state repression, state actors’ mixed verbal messages, and non-media actors’ dissonant frames spurred anti-U.S. beef protests in Korea. This article concludes by arguing that anti-American protests should be understood not only as a simple expression of anti-Americanism, but also as a product of complex interactions with their surrounding political and discursive environments.
1	This study examined the relationship between bodily comportment (tattoos and grooming) and the likelihood of going to college among a national sample of 11,010 adolescents gathered as part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Results show that adolescents with tattoos and those judged as poorly groomed by Add Health interviewers were significantly less likely to go to college after graduating from high school. These effects were similar in magnitude to those of other well-known demographic correlates of educational attainment, including family SES and family structure. Results also show that involvement in deviant activities accounted for much of the lower likelihood of going to college among adolescents with tattoos. Similar results were observed across gender, SES, and race groups, with the exception of Asians, for whom the lower likelihood of going to college among those with tattoos was especially pronounced. Overall, this study supports the conclusion that bodily signs constitute an important and relatively untapped source of information for predicting college matriculation among adolescents.
0	In recent years the scale of many business services -- technical support, telemarketing, debt collection, and all other forms of customer interaction -- has become global. India’s call centers are increasingly part of the emerging global communication regime. This development, however, raises the question how such cross-cultural global communication is possible, especially in view of the problem of double contingency, which points to a fundamental fragility of all social communication. Drawing on a yearlong ethnography of international call centers in Gurgaon, India, this article seeks to solve the riddle of global business communication by showing how it relies on a transmutation of cultural communication into systemic communication. Two processes of transmutation -- neutralization and mimesis -- are explored. Neutralization refers to attempts at pruning unwanted cultural particulars while mimesis refers to simulating desired cultural elements.
1	This article examines factors associated with social movements' abilities to disrupt corporate targets. I identify two kinds of disruption: market disruption and mediated disruption. Market disruption deters the ability of the corporate target to effectively accrue and use market resources, while mediated disruption occurs as a tactic communicates a movement's claims about the target through third party intermediaries, like the media, thereby disrupting the target's image and reputation. Using data on corporate boycotts in the United States from 1990 to 2005, the analyses assess the extent to which movement characteristics or target characteristics cause stock price declines of boycotted companies-i.e., market disruption-and the frequency of national media attention given to boycotts-i.e., mediated disruption. The analyses indicate that target characteristics matter more in shaping a boycott's initial market disruption; however, both movement and target characteristics affect mediated disruption. Certain movement characteristics, like social movement organization (SMO) formality, public demonstrations, and celebrity endorsements, enable mediated disruption but have no effect on market disruption. A firm's size makes it vulnerable to both market and mediated disruption, while slack resources help a firm avoid market disruption. A target's reputational ranking initially buffers it from market disruption but increases its vulnerability to mediated disruption. The results indicate that the two kinds of disruption are interrelated. Market disruption has a marginal effect on the intensity of subsequent media coverage and ongoing media attention accentuates further market disruption.
0	This study explores to what degree youth under age 18 who go before their states Juvenile Parole Boards waive their rights to an attorney at the Parole Board hearings.  Only six states in the United States have Juvenile Parole Boards which determine whether youth will be allowed to live in their communities after they have been incarcerated because of law violations. Other states have juvenile parole units, but they do not serve as formal bodies to oversee the rights of children who have been incarcerated.  This study explores the differences between juvenile parole boards who are formal and informal, and to what degree children have rights in each.  It is concluded that youth who have been incarcerated generally do not go before parole boards with any legal representation at all.  While they are informed of their rights to counsel before the parole boards make determinations on their status, almost all youth waive their rights to have an attorney present or represent them.  This is due primarily to the fact that youth have no access to money to pay for attorneys, and that public defenders are not usually readily available for them.  It is also due in part to parole boards not wanting to extend the hearing time, which would create a potential back-log of cases and greater time and resource demands on those who hear the cases and make final determinations.
1	Studies suggest that students who participate in extracurricular activities benefit in a number of ways. However, schools provide different opportunities to participate in these activities. Using information from high school yearbooks and administrative data on students and schools in North Carolina, we examine whether school characteristics influence the numbers and types of extracurricular activities available, whether schools providing more and diverse activities have higher participation rates, and whether these schools have better academic outcomes. We find that school size and poverty levels significantly influence the number and types of activities available, with larger schools and those schools with more affluent student bodies offering more activities. In addition, schools with more activities available tend to have higher participation rates. Opportunities to participate are associated with positive academic outcomes for the school, even when controlling for school resources. For some-but not all-activities, student participation rates mediate the relationship between activity availability and the school's academic profile. For benefits to be present, schools must provide these resources, and students must invest in them. 
0	This paper explores notions of the American dream ideology, particularly its embracing of a degree of inequality in principle, and argues that it is not the static constant that academics and popular commentators have often taken it as.  Rather, I argue that it is a dynamic concept that is continually questioned or reaffirmed and renegotiated with economic and historical shifts, and I document some examples of such shifts and their effect on the dominant ideology.  I then explore changes in the political realm, particularly high levels of inequality in forms of political participation, what implications they hold for the American dream, and if such changes have led to challenges to or renegotiations of the ideology.  Although it seems that high levels of inequality in both the economic and political realms should challenge certain tenets of the American dream, in many cases this has not occurred.  I identify five major barriers that inhibit actual inequality from challenging the benefits of inequality in principle, which reveal the contradictions inherent in the American dream and the complicated ways in which Americans attempt to resolve these contradictions.  However, despite these barriers, ideas do sometimes change, and I explore the possibilities that would enable such change.
1	It is well known that marital ethnic endogamy declines by immigrant generation, but there is little information on how many generations are required for full marital assimilation. This study for 1880-1910 includes information on the birthplace of men's grandparents, so we can compare the first, second, third, and later generations. We estimate the odds of marrying a native white woman with native-born parents (NWNP) for Irish, Germans, British, and men of other ethnicities. Most groups even in their third generation still show a significantly lower rate of marital assimilation than native stock men. But mixed ancestry (having at least one NWNP parent or grandparent) can result in nearly complete marital assimilation by the third generation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	The 2002 Report of the Taylor Committee of Inquiry into a Comprehensive Social Security System was the result of an unprecedented review of the South African system of social welfare, aimed at recommending widespread policy changes. A key recommendation in the Report was the phased introduction of a Basic Income Grant (BIG) on a universal, non-means tested basis. In this way, the report responded positively to widespread demands by labor and civil society organizations for a form of income to be provided on a decommodified basis, or independently from individual employment conditions. Central in such demands for income decommodification was the recognition that existing social security programs are related to stable waged employment and exclude an increasing number of long-term unemployed and contingent workers. This paper argues that the Taylor Reports approach questioned earlier social policies, which proposed a mode of social insertion that predominantly emphasized labor market participation and heavily commodified social provisions. At the same time, however, the extremely cautious, politically inconclusive approach to the BIG contained in the Report reflects a powerful opposition to decommodification within a government policy discourse that continuously praises work ethics and wage labor discipline while stigmatizing welfare dependency.
1	"The authors investigate the origins of homophily in a large university community, using network data in which interactions, attributes, and affiliations are all recorded over time. The analysis indicates that highly similar pairs do show greater than average propensity to form new ties; however, it also finds that tie formation is heavily biased by triadic closure and focal closure, which effectively constrain the opportunities among which individuals may select. In the case of triadic closure, moreover, selection to ""friend of a friend"" status is determined by an analogous combination of individual preference and structural proximity. The authors conclude that the dynamic interplay of choice homophily and induced homophily, compounded over many ""generations"" of biased selection of similar individuals to structurally proximate positions, can amplify even a modest preference for similar others, via a cumulative advantage like process, to produce striking patterns of observed homophily."
1	Using data from the 1996 Survey of Income and Program Participation, we examine 4476 school-age children in 2569 families with matched pairs of married fathers and mothers to study children's academic progress as a function of fathers' and mothers' employment circumstances, with a particular focus on involuntary employment separations. We draw on weekly work histories, collected at 4-month intervals, to characterize parental employment circumstances over a two-year period. Results find no significant associations between mothers' employment experiences and children's academic progress, even in households where mothers earn more than fathers. In contrast, fathers' experience of involuntary employment separations is associated with children's academic progress. On average, fathers' experience of involuntary employment separations is associated with a higher likelihood of children's grade repetition and suspension/expulsion from school. However, subgroup analyses reveal this association only in households where mothers earn more than fathers. We conclude that the adverse impacts of fathers' involuntary employment separations in two-parent families have less to do with income losses than with family dynamics. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

One aspect of attempting to moralize a cultural practice is the relative status of the object of moral concern to which a moral claim is made. If the object of moral concern has a high level of status, the moral claim is more likely be seen as credible outside of the ranks of the claims-making social movement or institution. In order to explore this hypothesis, newspaper coverage of stories about the animal rights movement and tobacco control/anti-smoking movements from 1975-1999 were examined in order to determine if coverage of some moral claims increased or decreased based upon the object of moral concern in question. These findings indicate that claims made towards innocent objects of moral concern   familiar companion animals and children  were more likely to gain media coverage, suggesting that efforts to alter the cultural perceptions of the host society are facilitated by making moral claims towards high status objects of moral concern.
0	This project examines how ex-offenders use positive forms of social (Coleman 1988, Putnam 2000) and human capital (Coleman 1988), after release from incarceration.  Ex-offenders face many obstacles that seriously limit their life-chances when returning to society (Petit and Western 2004). Such forms of capital are vital to improving the life-chances of male ex-offenders (Richards 2003, Richards 2004, Marbley and Ferguson 2005). Within this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews are administered to five male ex-inmates. Respondents cited education and twelve-step programs/recovery from substance abuse as important forms of human capital, and supportive family and friends as important forms of social capital.  Interestingly, 12-step recovery programs were described by ex-inmates as both human and social capital. Only once the experiences of ex-inmates are understood, can ex-inmates gain access to the social and human capital necessary to truly and successfully reintegrate into society.
1	While some U.S. corporations have adopted a host of diversity management programs, many have done little or nothing. We explore the forces promoting six diversity programs in a national sample of 816 firms over 23 years. Institutional theory suggests that external pressure for innovation reinforces internal advocacy. We argue that external pressure and internal advocacy serve as alternatives, such that when external pressure is already high, increases in internal advocacy will not alter the likelihood of program adoption. Moreover, institutional theory points to functional need as a driver of innovation. We argue that in the case of innovations designed to achieve new societal goals, functional need, as defined in this case by the absence of workforce diversity or the presence of regulatory oversight, is less important than corporate culture. Our findings help explain the spotty coverage of diversity programs. Firms that lack workforce diversity are no more likely than others to adopt programs, but firms with large contingents of women managers are more likely to do so. Pro-diversity industry and corporate cultures promote diversity programs. The findings carry implications for public policy.
1	In this paper, we examine the question of whether religion-affiliation, beliefs, and practice-provides a source Of Marital strength and stability in the lives of American couples. Unlike most previous studies, we focus on religion and marital quality among 433 low-income married couples with co-residential minor children, using recently collected survey data on both spouses sampled in the Marital and Relationship Survey (MARS). Our working hypothesis is that religiosity is a positive force for marital quality among low-income couples, and that a practicing faith can buffer the negative effects of economic stress on marital quality. The results indicate that most low-income couples have unexpectedly high scores on the various dimensions of marital quality (e.g., commitment, emotional support, etc.). Religious affiliation and personal religious beliefs are less important for marital quality than if couples share similar beliefs about God's divine plans for them and their relationship, if they pray together, or if they attend religious services together. On the other hand, the stress-buffering hypothesis received little support in our analysis. At a minimum, the results clearly highlight the potential role of religion in the marital lives of low-income couples. The implication is that faith-based organizations (including churches and synagogues) may have a particularly strong role to play in nurturing the spiritual lives and enhancing the quality of the intimate marital relationships of their flocks. 
0	Recent studies examining the effect of international human rights treaties on country-level practices have concluded that treaties are ineffective, counterproductive, or effective only for countries that would respect human rights even in the absence of treaty commitments. Analysts typically attribute the widespread decoupling between treaty membership and subsequent practices to willful and calculated disobedience, and they blame weak treaty monitoring and enforcement for the implementation gap. Using two-stage regression models with data for up to 143 countries between the 1980s and 2005 to analyze compliance with two widely studied human rights treaties, this paper examines whether the characteristics of countries themselves—rather than the properties of treaty regimes—are responsible for decoupling, with particular emphasis on countries’ capacity to implement treaty terms. I find that human rights treaties are most effective in countries characterized by a high degree of domestic order, institutionalized constraints on power, and stability. Decoupling in human rights treaty regimes is not due solely to “strategic” window dressing; rather, it often reflects the very limited state capacities of many countries to comply with the treaties they have ratified.
1	We use data from the U S Survey of Consumer Finances and a framework that accounts for intrahousehold dynamics to examine bank account ownership for low-income couples We find that even among families who are banked some family members are not Those without accounts may lack access to financial services be at a disadvantage within their families or face financial risks if their partnerships end Our results indicate that men and women are equally likely to be banked but the factors predicting whether or not they have accounts differ Women with more bargaining power are more likely to hold bank accounts and their families are more likely to be banked Moreover individual characteristics of male and the female partners have different effects on the chances that they their partners or their families are banked 
0	"Building on the advances made by feminist reconsiderations of methods, methodology and epistemology, this paper calls for an alliance between feminist social science and the emerging field of queer theory and gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender studies.  By challenging the assumptions of traditional scientific approaches to research on sexual minority groups and sexual communities, a distinctly ""queer"" approach is advocated that adopts a reflexive position of subjectivity, context and performativity.  Beginning with a critique of essentialist approaches that privilege gay/lesbian, man/woman, and object/subject, this queer approach to social science advances a framework of critical sexualities that moves social science and knowledge into an arena of inclusivity and multiple identities rather than monolithic dualisms and identity politics.  The implications of this project are clear:  a fundamental rethinking of identity categories that transcend traditional, stagnant dualisms."
1	"Are indigenous investors in Third World export platforms more stable than their allegedly ""footloose"" foreign rivals? While mainstream economists hold that investor behavior is independent of investor identity and therefore call for the parallel treatment of domestic and foreign firms, their critics hold that indigenous investors are more dedicated than their foreign counterparts and therefore call for industrial policies designed to cultivate and defend native entrepreneurs. Who is correct? The author uses a unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data to document and account for the relative stability and dynamism of indigenous investors in the Dominican Republic's largest export processing zone and thereby brings economic sociology back from the margins of development theory-and development theory back into the heartland of sociology."
0	Self-efficacy is a social psychological construct that is conceptualized from an agentic perspective and refers to the motivation to perceive oneself as a causal agent.  A recent work place intervention within a division of a large Australian retail organization was designed to empower workers through the 4 sources of self-efficacy information: enactive attainment, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion and emotional arousal.   This information was delivered via a Forum Theatre setting, a technique traditionally used as a catalyst for political action amongst oppressed groups.  Preliminary results suggest the interventions format has lead to an increase in employee self-efficacy, empowerment and engagement as well as improved organizational performance.  This paper describes the theoretical nexus between self-efficacy, work motivation and employee engagement and outlines a research program utilizing Forum Theatre as a vehicle to shift power to workers while concurrently meeting organizational objectives.  The use of Forum Theatre suggests that another world is indeed possible for disengaged and alienated workers, a world where they are empowered.
0	This paper explores the fertility assimilation of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries as identified in the American Community Survey.  I discovered patterns across generations of immigrants that suggest fertility assimilation for all regions in the sample.  I also found extremely high fertility for immigrants emigrating from sub-Saharan Africa.  I further explored this finding by comparing the fertility rates of immigrants from Christian-majority countries in sub-Saharan Africa to fertility rates of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  This analysis suggests that educational selection plays a significant role in explaining the differences in sub-Saharan African immigrants. Evidence also suggests that religious could play a role in affecting fertility rates from this region.
0	Although it is a common occurrence in capitalist countries, the experience of unemployment often triggers further economic burdens for workers. Most displaced workers face adverse consequences in terms of unemployment duration and earnings losses upon reemployment, but these effects are patterned by worker characteristics and economic context. We investigate how reemployment outcomes vary for workers in times of economic instability. We use queuing theory to explain the variation in outcomes for displaced workers of different sex, race, and age groups and expect queuing effects to be most pronounced during periods of economic decline as fewer job opportunities and increased competition push women and minorities further down the queue.  We use two waves of the CPS Displaced Workers Supplement, one comprised of workers who were displaced during the current recession (2007-2009) and another consisting of workers who lost their jobs prior to the recession (2005-2007). We find that the scarring effects of unemployment, as well as inequalities in the experience of unemployment, are conditional on the general economic context of the period examined. Thus, we argue that researchers should view unemployment as a trigger event whose effects are both malleable and at least partially responsible for future inequalities across the life-course.
1	Though many studies have suggested that social and behavioral skills play a central role in gender stratification processes, we know little about the extent to which these skills affect gender gaps in academic achievement. Analyzing data from the Early Child Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort, we demonstrate that social and behavioral skills have substantively important effects on academic outcomes from kindergarten through fifth grade. Gender differences in the acquisition of these skills, moreover, explain a considerable fraction of the gender gap in academic outcomes during early elementary school. Boys get roughly the same academic return to social and behavioral skills as their female peers, but girls begin school with more advanced social and behavioral skills and their skill advantage grows over time. While part of the effect may reflect an evaluation process that rewards students who better conform to school norms, our results imply that the acquisition of social and behavioral skills enhances learning as well. Our results call for a reconsideration of the family and school-level processes that produce gender gaps in social and behavioral skills and the advantages they confer for academic and later success. 
1	A neighborhood's normative climate is linked to, but conceptually distinct from, its structural characteristics such as poverty and racial/ethnic composition. Given the deleterious consequences of early sexual activity for adolescent health and well-being, it is important to assess normative influences on youth behaviors such as sexual debut, number of sex partners, and involvement in casual sexual experiences. The current study moves beyond prior research by constructing a measure of normative climate that more fully captures neighborhood norms, and analyzing the influence of normative climate on behavior in a longitudinal framework. Using recently geo-coded data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (TARS), we analyze the effect of normative climate on adolescents' sexual behaviors. Results indicate that variation in neighborhood normative climates increases adolescents' odds of sexual debut and casual sex, and is associated with their number of sex partners, even after accounting for neighborhood structural disadvantage and demographic risk factors. 
0	This paper aims to describe a theoretical account for the varying relationship between the state and voluntary agencies in delivering social services. By addressing how both traditional opponents pave a way for relational linkages of social provisions, the paper elaborates the way of constructing and locating inter-sectoral relations in the context of welfare politics, which will be shifting over time. Against the previous categorization of state-voluntary sector links, primarily based upon instrumental utilities of the voluntary sector, this study presents an alternative relational linkage model that can be socially constructed by state autonomy, organized voluntarism and interactions between them. Such a historical-institutionalist approach results in four possible categories: legitimization, mobilization, cooptation, and accommodation.
0	Artistic knowledge workers, such as music professionals, are employed in casual, occupational labor markets in which they act strategically as entrepreneurs, occupation association members,  or both as they pursue their careers and American Dreams.  The purpose of this paper is to develop empirically a new typology of artistic knowledge workers&#8217; American Dreams that facilitates research in the new occupational sociology on the career strategies of artistic knowledge workers.   We develop a three-dimensional typology of American Dreams based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 71 Nashville music professionals.   We conclude by suggesting a research agenda in the new occupational sociology on the interplay between artistic knowledge workers&#8217; American Dreams and their career-mobility strategic actions in the knowledge economy.
0	This project brings spatial and symbolic boundaries together by asking how people construct class-based moral boundaries from the appearance of homes and neighborhoods. Eighty-four randomly selected homeowners were interviewed in working- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods outside Boston, Massachusetts and Eugene, Oregon about the criteria by which they define good neighborhoods and the visual cues they use to assess those criteria. Upper-middle-class respondents valued privacy, personal space, and diverse taste as displayed by large homes and open spaces. These respondents derided laziness, negligence, and close-mindedness, which they read from disrepair and clutter. Working-class respondents valued neighborliness and efficiency, which they saw reflected in small homes and unconventional uses of space. They denigrated isolation and wastefulness, displayed primarily by large homes and yards. Respondents in all sub-samples resisted talking explicitly about class, tying their judgments to the moral worth of residents rather than the social status of a neighborhood.
1	"This paper analyzes strategies used by women in a collegiate, male-defined sport (rugby) to deal with identity dilemmas. Players challenged conventional notions of passive femininity through tough play, yet encountered sexist and homophobic stigma from outsiders. Rather than resisting and rejecting the power of this stigma, they engaged in defensive othering-subordinates distancing themselves from other subordinates and reinforcing the legitimacy of a devalued identity in the process. Specifically, the women identified with dominants, engaged in normative identification, and propped up dominants. Their identity work resulted in a ""heterosexy-fit"" identity that ultimately reinforced heterosexism and gender inequality."
0	The purpose of this paper is to identify similarities or differences in the definitions of autonomy and accountability between home and overseas branch campuses.  It examines the value and policy practices of state authorities and regional accreditation organizations, taking the cases of New York and Massachusetts States.  The study argues that the meanings of autonomy and accountability substantially differ between the US home and overseas branch campuses because of different operational modes of quality assurance.
0	"An occupation that requires workers to pursue specialized higher education and obtain exclusive work skills often is granted the prestigious ""professional"" status. Yet, while child care is a skilled profession, the demand on child care providers to supply friendship and love leads families to view caregivers as selfless friends, rather than experts. Can a form of professional social distance, or ""detached attachment,"" that is fortified by formal education offset the tribulations associated with providing emotional labor? To answer this question, I draw on in-depth interviews with 20 preschool teachers, in-home day care owners, nannies, and parents of young children who are in the care of these kinds of providers. I narrow in on providers with at least an undergraduate degree—an above average education for the occupational group. This study's results reveal that formal education is a universally-respected work asset that allows caregivers to present themselves as independent providers of expert knowledge solutions, rather than untrained ""mothers' helpers,"" and avoid the powerlessness normally associated with providing emotional labor. These providers present themselves as ""caring professionals,"" not just workers in a care profession."
0	This paper works from the premise that to the extent that services do work for urban elites, how can their experience with service delivery inform pro-poor development? I draw on fieldwork at the offices of the state run electrical utility in Islamabad, Pakistan to address this question. The experience of urban elites in Islamabad has a surprising amount in common with the experiences of the poor as described in the anthropological literature on the margins of the state - with the significant caveat that the elites enjoy a greater degree of success. Both the urban elites of Islamabad and the examples of successful development outcomes in the global south (particularly Kerala) get the state to respond to their needs through direct contestation, a tactic that is largely glossed over in the pro-poor development strategies of the World Development Report.
1	It is still unclear to what extent time allocation retrospectively reported in questionnaires reflects people's actual behavior. Addressing this research gap, we analyze the congruence of time use information assessed through retrospective questionnaires and through experience sampling methodology. Participants completed standard survey questions on time allocation. In addition, a mobile-phone-based experience sampling technology obtained snapshots of, on average, 54 momentary activities in which respondents participated while pursuing their normal daily routines.
0	Could perceptions about mental illness etiology contribute to the discrepancy between the prevalence of people suffering from mental illness and the percentage of these individuals who seek treatment?  Using randomized vignette data from the 1996 General Social Survey Mental Health Module (n=1444), we examine if peoples beliefs about the cause of a mental illness (e.g., genetics, stress, bad character) influence their beliefs about treatment options.  Approximately 90 percent of respondents believed that the condition of the person in their vignette would improve with treatment versus improve on its own.  However, multivariate analyses indicate that those who believed that the condition had a physical cause were more likely to advocate professional treatment (e.g., psychiatrist, prescription medication), while beliefs that the cause was social were more associated with advocating informal treatment (e.g., self-help groups, talking to clergy).  After controlling for all perceived causes, only chemical imbalance and genetics were found to be associated with any treatment options.  The implications of these findings for public service messages about mental illness and substance abuse treatment are discussed.
1	This study applies advanced conceptualization and measurement to an analysis of acculturation among 1632 Mexican-heritage preadolescents. We assessed whether - and how - multiple measures combine to form a latent acculturation construct that groups individuals into classes; and determine how many and what classes (or types) of acculturation are experienced by this sample of 5th graders. Measures included attitudinal, behavioral, and linguistic acculturation, generation status, time in the US, ethnic identification, and contact with the culture of origin. The analysis identified five classes of acculturation, differing in size and characterized by specific measures of acculturation: less acculturated, moderately bicultural, strongly bicultural, highly acculturated, and marginalized. Although most youths fell into the first four classes, consonant with their exposure to American society, a small minority of youths fell into the last class. Despite substantial exposure to US culture and recent exposure to Mexican culture, these youth showed little affinity for either culture. 
1	This study offers a structural explanation for the female advantage in college completion rates stressing the importance of horizontal sex segregation across fields of study in shaping educational outcomes and gender inequality Results from a nationally representative sample of students who matriculated at 4-year institutions in 1995 reveal a high level of gender segregation by field of study Field of study creates the immediate learning environment for the students and between-major differences in academic and social arrangements such as different grading norms academic intensity size and social support-shape both female and male performance We find that this variation is a key factor in the creation of the female advantage in grades and graduation likelihood The simulation we conduct demonstrates that if sex integration were achieved and both groups had the male distribution of majors the female advantage in graduation likelihood and grades which remains after socioeconomic and academic factors are netted out would be substantially reduced 
1	This research investigates how family events in adult children's lives influence the timing of their parents' financial transfers. We draw on retrospective data collected by the German Socio-Economic Panel Study and use event history models to study the effects of marriage, divorce and childbirth on the receipt of large gifts from parents. We find increased chances of receiving real estate at marriage and in subsequent years, at childbirth, but not in the event of divorce. Large gifts of money are received in the years of marriage and divorce, but not at childbirth. Our findings indicate that parental gifts are triggered by adult children's economic need, but also point to a plurality of transfer motives and meanings for parents, adult children and their relationships.
1	We investigate whether mother's poor union quality attenuates the association between union instability and young children's behavioral adjustment. Using data from three waves of the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study to consider children born to married or cohabiting mothers (N = 1730), we determine that children who have experienced poor union quality between mothers and their partners have higher predicted aggressive behavior scores at age 3, regardless of whether they have experienced union transitions, compared to children who have experienced high-quality, stable unions. Children who have experienced instability in the context of higher-quality unions and relatively less acrimonious dissolutions are similar to children raised in high-quality stable unions in terms of predicted aggressive behavior scores. 
1	This study investigates the effect of segregationist murders, in conjunction with black protest, on federal passage of black voting-rights policies. Using time-series regression techniques, I find that white violence diminished federal responsiveness to black protest from the '30s through the end of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration. But by President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration and the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, violence stimulated government response to black protest. I argue that the historically contingent nature of the violence effect is attributable to the changing nature Of the audience. Segregationist violence seems to have helped the movement win Southern suffrage only when the audience was attentive, sympathetic and involved in the policy conflict.
1	Associations with a professional staff but no members (nonmembership advocacy organizations, or NMAOs) are the subject of lively debate. Many argue that their proliferation has allowed an expansion of advocacy without an accompanying growth in civic engagement. This article asks if there has been significant recent growth of NMAOs and if those organizations have displaced membership advocacy organizations (MAOs). The authors find no evidence for a proportional increase of NMAOs since the 1960s. Further, among all organizations in three populations-peace, women's issues, and human rights-NMAOs have not displaced MAOs. In particular, the authors find that MAO density shapes NMAO founding, as membership groups provide a base for professional advocacy These findings challenge the notion that U.S. civic life has undergone a systemic transformation away from organizational forms that promote civic engagement.
0	In the northern Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, a wave of street violence has replaced the civil wars and political violence of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to drug cartels and organized crime, key actors in the growing street violence include thousands of members of the transnational youth gangs such as la Mara Salvatrucha and la Mara Dieciocho. Studies have found that in many popular barrios where gang membership is high, Pentecostal religion represents a well-advertised “refuge” from the gang (Castro and Carranza 2005; Gomez and Vasquez 2001; Wolseth 2008). Recent research by the author shows that Pentecostal congregations in Northern Central America have engaged in a great deal of ministry aimed at “rescuing” gang members from the gang and from the consequences of increasingly popular “social cleansing” campaigns on the part of police and vigilante groups. I argue here that such work constitutes one form of human rights work and I discuss some of the factors that propel Pentecostals into such often-risky work.
1	"Following Tocqueville, many scholars consider associations ""schools of democracy"" because members can develop civic capacities within them. This article identifies the distribution of civic development opportunities across civic sectors (e.g., politics, service, recreation), focusing on understudied apolitical groups. New data is introduced on a set of often referenced, but rarely studied, associations: choral societies. Choruses are shown to offer numerous opportunities for interpersonal interaction, governance experience and institutional relationships. Data are compared to opportunities offered by associations in other civic sectors. Apolitical arts associations are found to provide as many or more opportunities for individual civic development than their politically and service-oriented counterparts suggesting their potential for shrinking the political communication gap between naturally politically interested and disinterested citizens."
0	Using the ‘2003 Spanish Time Use Survey’ (N = 1797), I examine variations in residential fathers’ child care involvement. My sample includes heterosexual couples with at least one child aged 0 to 9 and where the two partners reported a time-use diary. Contrary to the majority of studies on child care time, I explore three subsamples of households with the youngest child at different life course stages (from 0 to 2; from 3 to 5; from 6 to 9). I investigate different mechanisms associated with four dependent variables related to father’s child care investments: 1) physical child care; 2) interactive child care; 3) father’s share of physical child care; 4) child care without co-presence of the partner. Three hypotheses are tested: (i) the human capital and concerted cultivation; (ii) the education differential in gender child care patterns; (iii) the time-availability and bargaining. My preliminary results show that individual education (and to a lesser extent spousal education) has a positive and strong effect on father’s child care time, but only in families with young children. In contrast, education has no effects on interactive child care time, and only a moderate impact on the father’s share of the couple’s physical child care. The employment status of the mother is the most powerful explanatory variable of all the variables included in the study.
0	Testing Durkheimian principles of social organization, Guy Swansons seminal work, The Birth of the Gods, demonstrated a link between the rise of monotheism and the number of sovereign political organizations. In 1975, Ralph Underhill challenged Swansons claims on theoretical and methodological grounds; and, using the data culled from the Ethnographic Atlas (Murdock 1962), demonstrated that economic complexity had a stronger impact on the evolution of monotheism than political complexity. A brief debate ensued, in which both scholars maintained their position was most accurate. The paper below revisits this debate, and using the same data, and nearly identical variables, employs multivariate analysis and structural equation modeling to assess their claims. It is contended that (1) Underhills assertions appear to hold up best under the scrutiny of more sophisticated analyses; (2) Swansons findings appear to not bear out under the same scrutiny; and (3) two factors otherwise ignored by both scholarslevel of technological advancement and intensive agricultureappear to have strong positive relationships with increasing levels of religious complexity.
0	The paper shows how greater attention to relational work helps to understand how, when and to what effect organizations collaborate. This concept, which is associated especially with the work of Viviana Zelizer and Charles Tilly, has not typically been applied to analyses of organization. The paper draws on interviews conducted with large and small American manufacturing firms to highlight the ways in which firms mutually define the nature of their relationship, establish basic ground rules, and determine what will and will not be exchanged. Then, drawing on that discussion, it identifies conditions in which there is theoretical payoff to understanding those relationships in this very explicitly dialogic manner. It does so: (1) by demonstrating that there is endemic ambiguity in many inter-organizational relations today; (2) by noting that this creates considerable space for active relational work by parties to the interaction; and (3) by showing that explicit attention to the ways in which firms carry out their relational work reveals important but otherwise obscured variation in the functioning of the productive economy.
1	This paper reports findings that assess the relationship between the resurgence in conservative political strength and union density in the United States. The conservative Republican return to political power after 1968 is likely to have produced added declines in union membership. Yet despite close political regulation of labor-management disputes, sociologists have paid little attention to the influential political determinants of success in these contests. Using fixed-effects estimation, this analysis assesses the relationship between the political strength of the political party most hostile to labor and union density. With multiple factors held constant, the results suggest that increased Republican presence in the state legislatures along with Republican control of the presidency and the governor's office after 1989 helped to reduce union memberships. The results also indicate that increases in the percentage of African Americans produces greater union strength but not in the ex-Confederate states. Added findings suggest two policies controlled by the states have influential effects on this outcome. 
0	Public confidence in social institutions underwent a decline in the past decades. However, confidence in scientific community as an institution, which is treated as confidence in science in this paper, has not declined as dramatically as other social institutions. Various studies address the trend of the publics confidence in science and the difference in confidence in science across demographic and social-economic variables. This paper reviews the issue of confidence in science under various perspectives and specifically examines its association with Internet use, with the assumption that Internet use might promote confidence in science. MCA results from GSS2000 data confirm this strong association between the two. The magnitude of this effect differs with sex, age, and different usage of Internet. With the effect of Internets boost in confidence in science and with the expansion of Internet use, we may expect a high level of confidence in science in the overall population. Suggestions for future research are made.
0	Researchers have almost unanimously concluded that parental involvement benefits children, without considering that their studies typically examine the effects of perceptions of parental involvement, not actual parental involvement.  This analysis uses data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) to compare parent and teacher reports of involvement in the school, and to examine the effect of each report on student test scores.  Findings suggest that a discrepancy exists between parents and teachers reports of parental involvement in the school, which is partially explained by the students race and socioeconomic status.  Teachers appear to perceive that higher-SES and white parents are more involved in the school than the parents self-reports indicate.  Finally, parent and teacher reports of involvement have different effects on student math and reading test scores, with teachers reports having a significantly stronger effect.
0	The current anti-human trafficking movement has been criticized for being nothing more than a moral crusade, for being overly focused on criminality at the expense of a human rights perspective, and for being heavy handed in its focus on sex trafficking and women and girls to the detriment of other kinds of labor trafficking and male victims.  While there seems to be a turn within the movement to acknowledge some of these issues, there continues to be a failure to recognize how the movement itself—including activism, policy making, law enforcement and victim service response—is guilty of reproducing many of the same heteronormative, gender binaries that exist within larger society, which actively construct vulnerable female bodies and invincible male bodies.  Using key queer theory on how bodies become gendered, sexualized, raced and nationalized, and giving examples of how anti-trafficking prevention, prosecution and protection efforts effectively reproduce these norms, I will show how the movement operates within a framework of oppression, rather than works to challenge or transform the oppression that results in a social problem like human trafficking.
1	This paper analyses the relationship between country-level gender empowerment and individual-level divisions of housework. Pairing the 2004 United Nations gender empowerment measure (GEM) with individual-level (n = 18,560) data from the 2004 European Social Survey, the author compares the relationship between a country's GEM score, both as an index and as disaggregated measures, and respondents' housework hours and housework proportions. The GEM index has a positive and linear relationship with men's housework hours and a positive and non-linear relationship with men and women's housework proportions and with women's housework hours. For the disaggregated GEM measures, women's representation in parliament is positively associated with men's housework hours and proportions and women's housework hours. Women's labor market status, including the percent of women in professional positions and female-male wage ratios, is negatively associated with women's housework hours and proportions. Finally, the cross-level interactions demonstrate theoretically important relationships to the housework literature.

Although there is some curvilinearity at low levels of prevalence, the relationship is generally negative. Thus, all else equal, where a particular crime is frequent, any punishment applied to it is likely to be mild; conversely, where a crime is infrequent, its punishment ought to be severe. Using hierarchical regression models, the authors support this hypothesis with 1988 homicide conviction and imprisonment decisions in 32 U. S. counties."

One the one hand, market liberation had been viewed as a contemporary form of modernization that Asia must catch up with (or control within its own territory) in order to compete in the capitalist world market. On the other hand, new democracies had emerged in Asia since it gave birth to people power in 1986, when a sea of demonstrators peacefully overthrew a dictator in the Philippines. In this study, we explore whether and to what extent these two institutional changes may account for Asia’s trends in income inequality over the period of 1980-2010. In the analysis, the dependent variable is the degree of inequality in the income distribution within country, as measured by the Gini index. We use an unbalanced cross-national panel data set covering 30 years on 20 Asian countries/societies scattering in 3 regions: 6 in the North of East Asia (China, Hong Kong, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea, and Taiwan), 8 in the South of East Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam), and 6 in the South Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka). Evidence from random-effects models of income inequality in Asia indicates different forces at work during different time periods: while the integration with global economy had raised inequality during the 1990s and 2000s net of several controls, the institutionalization of democracy helped reduce inequality in the 2000s.
0	This research conceptualizes canon building as a historical process. I examine this process longitudinally by tracking all 308 artists who exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show to see which are included in the 13 editions of the art history textbook Gardner's Art through the Ages from 1926 to 2009. Specifically, I examine how artist attributes (e.g., nationality, gender) and an important legitimating organization (the Museum of Modern Art) shape the canonization process over time. Regression results indicate that while MoMA exhibition is a critical factor for inclusion within the canon, other historical forces and social understandings may also be at work.
0	This paper explores how Colorado, which accepted 4000 evacuees from the Gulf Coast following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, provided services through public and private agencies and the challenges that arose. Housing southern Blacks presented several challenges for state and voluntary organization officials unaccustomed to many of the cultural differences from the region as well as the deep distrust of official efforts to assist them. These agencies adapted their practice in significant ways. Using interview data with evacuees, service providers, agency leaders, and government officials, we examine which culturally and racially-based challenges arose and how agencies aimed to mitigate them. First, relief agencies modified food service, including the use of ingredients and recipes to make meals more familiar to clients. Second, members of multi-racial and predominantly African American churches began volunteering to provide human contact and spiritual uplift for evacuees. Third, Colorado mobilized a multi-racial coalition of churches, victims assistance programs, local chapters of national charities, and the counties in which those affected settled. In this paper, we examine the complicated issues that arise as private agencies determine eligibility for services or moral worthiness in ways not permitted by state agents. Private organizationsboth religious and secularhave long been relied upon as a source of relief in disasters. In this case, the official delegation of short-term relief and long-term recovery to local churches provides opportunity to examine the limits of the state as well as the strengths and limits of volunteerism, particularly as they are deployed to manage racially charged interactions.
1	Little is known about how marital sexual interaction influences eventual marital disruption, despite research in various disciplines examining the sex lives of the married. This relatively unexplored area compels sociological inquiry, since most Americans will marry, yet nearly half of all American marriages are expected to end in divorce. Surprisingly, no one has posed the question: does frequent, satisfying, and/or agreeable marital sexual interaction early in marriage help to sustain a marriage? With panel data from the Marriage Matters Panel Survey of Newlywed Couples, 1998-2004, I utilize these three indicators (frequency, satisfaction, and agreement) to assess this question. The results provide evidence that the influence of marital sexuality on marital disruption is limited. However, interesting gender nuances appear and indicate that husband's satisfaction with physical intimacy early in marriage has a consistent positive effect on whether or not the couple will experience a marital disruption. 
1	In Canada there is an increasing prevalence of chronic medical conditions and diseases related to a modifiable risk factor - physical inactivity. Therefore, it is important to have regular, robust, population-based surveillance of physical activity engagement that can be used to develop policy interventions and measure their success. The primary objective of this study is to describe the methods used to quantify the proportion of Canadians engaging in physical activities at the intensities and durations required to either maintain or enhance their health. Results indicate the overall proportion of Canadians meeting maintenance levels of physical activity has increased between 1992 (76.2%), 1998 (77.3%), and 2005 (82.5%), but over the same time the proportion meeting enhancement levels of physical activity has decreased (38.1%, 36.6%, and 30.6%, respectively). Furthermore, the results demonstrate the potential applications of time-use data for public health and quality of life research. 
1	"We use a lifecourse framework to examine how the ""new risk economy"" has left middle-age professionals, managers and executives more vulnerable to job loss and unemployment despite high levels of human capital. Using in-depth qualitative data from 77 recently-unemployed white-collar workers, we examine perceptions of macro-economic forces and their implications for respondents' career-recovery plans and expectations for their own and their children's future career pathways. We find that most respondents attributed their job loss to factors associated with globalization and used coping strategies that involved adapting a 'free-agent"" mentality in the face of declining employer loyalty and deprofessionalization to manage perceptions of age bias. Respondents also make mastering the ""new risk economy"" a developmental goal for themselves and their children."
0	This paper explores the nature of civil discourse by examining Shannon Cain’s performance art project, Tucson, the Novel: An Experiment in Literature and Civil Discourse. The project was initiated in the summer of 2010, just months before the January shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. In the paper I argue that civil discourse’s dual meanings of polite and political speech must be reconciled in order to fully address the question of democratic participation.
1	"Using data from the New Immigrant Survey, we examine the religious beliefs and practices of new legal immigrants to the United States. We find that Christian immigrants are more Catholic, more Orthodox, and less Protestant than American Christians, and that those immigrants who are Protestant are more likely to be evangelical. In addition to being more Catholic and more Orthodox than American Christians, the new immigrants are also paradoxically less Christian, with a fifth reporting some other faith. Detailed analysis of reported church attendance at places of origin and in the United States suggest that immigration is a disruptive event that alienates immigrants from religious practice rather than ""theologizing"" them. In addition, our models clearly show that people who join congregations in the United States are highly selected and unrepresentative of the broader population of immigrants in any faith. In general, congregational members were more observant both before and after emigration, were more educated, had more cumulative experience in the United States, and were more likely to have children present in the household and be homeowners and therefore yield biased representations of all adherents to any faith. The degree of selectivity and hence bias also varies markedly both by religion and nationality. "
1	We summarize prior theories on the adaptation process of the contemporary immigrant second generation as a prelude to presenting additive and interactive models showing the impact of family variables, school contexts and academic outcomes on the process. For this purpose, we regress indicators of educational and occupational achievement in early adulthood on predictors measured three and six years earlier. The Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study, used for the analysis, allows us to establish a clear temporal order among exogenous predictors and the two dependent variables. We also construct a Downward Assimilation Index, based on six indicators and regress it on the same set of predictors. Results confirm a pattern of segmented assimilation in the second generation, with a significant proportion of the sample experiencing downward assimilation. Predictors of the latter are the obverse of those of educational and occupational achievement. Significant interaction effects emerge between these predictors and early school contexts, defined by different class and racial compositions. Implications of these results for theory and policy are examined.
0	This paper involves a theoretical and empirical exploration of the expansion of a model of accountability and transparency in world society, and how this model affects nation-states worldwide.  We are particularly interested in the fact that nation-states have attempted to become increasingly transparent actors in terms of reporting their national (financial) accounts. We investigate these national efforts towards greater accountability, as it is expressed in greater governmental attention given to global norms concerning national data compilation and disclosure, particularly after World War II. The preliminary investigations of this issue reveal interesting trends over the past several decades.  Since the 1980s, national governments across the globe (a) have provided greater amount of public data covering lager numbers of social, political, and economic domains, and (b) have tended to present their accounts and statistics in more standardized ways that conform to international principles and standards on data reporting. This research offers a macro-sociological perspective from which the development of global norms and their impact on nation-states can be studied.  It also offers sociological understanding of nation-states located in world society where they are provided with pressures and guidelines to become appropriate rational actors.
0	A feedback model in Social Influence Network Theory (SINT) models each subject-agent i by a summing element followed by an integrator to produce a non-parametrically specified probabilistic output  y(t) at time t, followed by a random number generator of binary decisions (Di = +1 or 1).  Each agent-model interconnects with the others by a weight matrix w. For a whole social network, a matrix product wD delivers social influences.  Initial value vector  y(1) in this model is exogenously exerted on decision-maker.    The feedback agent-model provides a probabilistic influence process among social agents.   The probability p(Di = +1) in SCT that the subject initially perceives an ambiguous object in a given one of two possible ways is designated x herein.   Stay probability  Ps(x) is the probability that SCT subject stays with that given one way in the face of disagreement on a second round, so p(Di = +1) = xPs(x) on the second round.    A cumulative probability p distribution C(p) of the error occurs in the in the model, where p=xPs(x). The difference of inverses C-1(1-xPs(x)) - C-1(1-x)  from a data set in SCT correspond to weights w in SINT.  The inverse C-1(1-x) vanishes when x=0.5.   The inverses C-1(1-xPs(x)) for Two-Other (Ternary) data were regressed according the inverses for One-Other (Binary) data.   The regression slope closely approximated the theoretical value of 2.0 provided the error distribution was Gaussian and failed if logistic.
0	Comparing the linkage between political economy and social welfare between advanced capitalist economies in East Asia, this paper suggests a two-model approach toward the East Asian welfare states. On the one hand, there are the nation-state model of Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and the city-state model of Hong Kong and Singapore on the other. The nation-state model, in particular, is based on historical ties between these three countries and similarities in their political economic regimes that feature a strong developmentalist orientation and welfare conservatism. But the recent move towards democratization in Korea and Taiwan has destabilized the conservative model of welfare capitalism, bringing about significant welfare expansion.
0	I maintain that it is useful and revealing to analytically separate glamour and charisma from each other because treating glamour and charisma as synonymous obscures certain social processes whereby glamour, charisma, or both are played up or played down to achieve particular goals. This is conceptual work that will add to a general understanding of charisma by drawing limits around the concept. I discuss charisma and glamour at two levels, building from an examination of individual-level glamour and charisma into an examination of group-level glamour and charisma. At either level of social life, the distinction between glamour and charisma appears to be useful because it helps uncover a cool, less energetic type of appeal as well as a hot, high-energy type. Conceptualizing glamour and charisma as somewhat separable phenomena also opens the door for future theorizing about how the mechanics of maintaining each phenomenon may differ and testing these propositions empirically.
1	"In this paper, I use survey data from high school students in Texas to examine the magnitude of peer correlation in college preferences and choices. In this survey, respondents (and their classmates) recorded their preferences for attending specific colleges, and a follow up survey recorded their college enrollment decisions. This paper uses this information to present the first empirical examination of whether individuals who report preferences for ""popular"" colleges are more likely to attend their preferred college. The rich data set allows the use of often unavailable information such as distance to college, and the construction of the ""popularity"" variable allows the use of school-level fixed effects. Results indicate that individuals with 10 percentage points more classmates with matching college preferences are 3 percentage points more likely to enroll in their preferred college. "
1	"In the 2006 American Community Survey (ACS), 6% of respondents with Latin American ancestry answered 'no' when asked whether they were Hispanic themselves. Conventional definitions of the Hispanic population exclude such respondents as 'not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino' even though they are self-identified Latin American descendants. Since their exclusion may bias our assessments of Hispanic social mobility, it is important to know more about them. Non-Hispanic identification is most common among Latin American descendants who (1) list both Latin American and non-Latin American ancestries, (2) speak only English, and (3) identify as White, Black, or Asian when asked about their 'race.' Ancestry and racial identity are considerably more influential than respondents' education, income, place of birth, or place of residence. These findings support both traditional straight-line assimilation and a more recent ""racialized assimilation"" theory in explaining discrepant responses to the ethnicity and ancestry questions among Latin American descendants.

0	Activists have emerged in response to perceived health threats attributed to natural gas drilling. This paper is one piece in a large multi-sited ethnographic account of natural gas drilling in the Barnett Shale, a geological formation in North Texas below a largely populated area. In it, I explore the framing of natural gas drilling as an environmental health threat by the grassroots activists who have emerged in response to the activity. Early on in the process air pollution was their primary concern, but increasingly activists have focused on water usage and pollution. Additionally, fears of cancer permeate the narrative, fears which are heightened by data which suggests increasing cancer incidence in Shale areas. I use social representation theory to guide my discussion.
1	Recent research suggests that the use of monetary sanctions as a supplementary penalty in state and federal criminal courts is expanding, and that their imposition creates substantial and deleterious legal debt. Little is known, however, about the factors that influence the discretionary imposition of these penalties. This study offers a comprehensive account of the role socio-cultural factors, especially race and ethnicity, have in this institutional sanctioning process. We rely on multilevel statistical analysis of the imposition of monetary sanctions in Washington State courts to test our theory. The theoretical framework emphasizes the need to treat race and ethnicity as complex cultural categories, the meaning and institutional effects of which may vary across time and space. Findings indicate that racialized crime scripts, such as the association of Latinos with drugs, affect defendants whose wrong-doing is stereotype congruent. Moreover, all individuals accused of committing racially and ethnically stigmatized offenses in racialized contexts may experience the courtesy stigma that flows from racialization. We find that race and ethnicity are not just individual attributes but cultural categories that shape the distribution of stigma and the institutional consequences that flow from it.
0	Persons with disabilities face physical and social barriers, negative societal attitudes, and public misunderstandings on a daily basis. Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a physical and visible change to ones body, resulting in the perception that ones body or person is broken. This study presents a unique opportunity, through the use of a projective drawing task, to understand how persons with SCI feel about themselves, as well as their perceptions of how others view them. The ultimate goal of this study is to inform and promote the use of visual methodology in social science research.
1	Efforts to develop a unified model of collective violence have been limited by the diverse array of events analyzed, from terrorist attacks to riots. This article seeks to develop a more inclusive theoretical and analytic framework by exploring the targets of violence, something that has received little disaggregated attention. We argue that consideration of who or what is targeted during the course of an event, together with collectivity size and the conditional role it may play, offers new theoretical insight into collective violence dynamics. Our analysis draws from newspaper records on a diverse range of collectivities, from parties to rallies to riots. We find that in many contexts, collectivity size increases the likelihood of violence against some targets, notably state actors, while reducing attacks on others. These findings provide the basis for a broader discussion of why unpacking targets is so critical to understanding the dynamics of collective violence.
1	"We investigate the turnover effects of an organizational innovation (ROWE-Results Only Work Environment) aimed at moving away from standard time practices to focus on results rather than time spent at work. To model rates of turnover, we draw on survey data from a sample of employees at a corporate headquarters (N = 775) and institutional records of turnover over eight months following the ROWE implementation. We find the odds of turnover are indeed lower for employees participating in the ROWE initiative, which offers employees greater work-time control and flexibility and that this is the case regardless of employees gender, age, or family life stage. ROWE also moderates the turnover effects of organizational tenure and negative home-to-work spillover, physical symptoms, and job insecurity with those in ROWE who report these situations generally less likely to leave the organization. Additionally ROWE reduces turnover intentions among those remaining with the corporation. This research moves the ""opting-out"" argument from one of private troubles to an issue of greater employee work-time control and flexibility by showing that an organizational policy initiative can reduce turnover."
1	Drawing on archival analysis and in-depth interviews, this article examines Colombia's adoption of policies for black Colombians in 1993. It argues that Afro-Colombian activists were able to seize upon changes in global policy norms around multiculturalism and state disequilibrium both by deploying traditional social movement strategies and by framing their demands in terms of ethnic difference. This case extends our understanding of how social movements make strategic use of political openings and also illustrates the circumstances under which an ethnic difference framing can be a more effective political strategy for achieving rights for black populations than a racial equality framing.
0	In this paper, I argue that clients contribute to inequality in high-status service professions.  Using data from a cohort sample of 76 current or former Wall Street professionals, I illustrate that clients homophily preferences shape sex- and racial-ethnic segregation within the securities industry.  I also reveal how some professionals partially insulate themselves from client biases against them by deliberately avoiding positions where their success would be most dependent on client relationships.  The findings support homophily theories.  In conclusion, I postulate that the strength of homophily preferences in the Wall Street context is related to the high-status of this service profession.
0	This pilot study is concerned with the construction of identity by gender variant individuals. In keeping with recent debates within the literature, a return is attempted to a consideration of the embodied nature of identity formation through a focus on the experiences of gender variant individuals within a queer athletic space. Butlers theories of performativity provide a basis for such a consideration of embodied identity, yet in their monologic nature they may fail to adequately consider the inherently dialogic nature of such identity constructions. To this end, Bakhtins arguments regarding the dialogic construction of meaning through language are proposed as the basis of an alternate approach to the study of such identity construction, one which acknowledges performative aspects while maintaining the interactive and contextual nature of such performances. The goal of this pilot study is thus twofold: to see in what ways this dialogical view of performativity may correspond to, or enable an increased understanding of, the experiences of gender variant individuals within a queer athletic space; as well as to determine the ways in which such a space enables gender variant individuals to construct embodied identities.
0	On-line platforms for socially generated content, such as Wikipedia, allow everyone to contribute and remove the contributions of others. This presents a trade-off: on the one hand, content improves quickly and mistakes are eliminated; on the other hand, deletion of content deprives its authors of the intrinsic pleasure of contributing and seeing their work in print, which may lead them to stop participating. We suggest that this trade-off is attenuated by the social structure around contributors. We hypothesize that actors involved in high density and high encapsulation structures will be least likely to abandon contributing. Analysis of the pattern of contributions to Wikipedia supports this assertion. The results underscore the importance of tight social structure for the success of collaborative content projects.
1	We use newly developed methods of measuring spatial segregation across a range of spatial scales to assess changes in racial residential segregation patterns in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2000. Our results point to three notable trends in segregation from 1990 to 2000: ( I) Hispanic-white and Asian-white segregation levels increased at both micro- and macro-scales; (2) black-white segregation declined at a micro-scale, but was unchanged at a macro-scale; and (3) for all three racial groups and for almost all metropolitan areas, macro-scale segregation accounted for more of the total metropolitan area segregation in 2000 than in 1990. Our examination of the variation in these trends among the metropolitan areas suggests that Hispanic-white and Asian-white segregation changes have been driven largely by increases in macro-scale segregation resulting from the rapid growth of the Hispanic and Asian populations in central cities. The changes in black-white segregation, in contrast, appear to be driven by the continuation of a 30-year trend in declining micro-segregation, coupled with persistent and largely stable patterns of macro-segregation. 
1	The theory of relative deprivation emphasizes that social comparisons contextualize how people experience impoverishment. An important application of this theory argues that relative deprivation that stems from unfavorable social comparisons can result in anger, normlessness and an increased likelihood of deviant behavior. We test this theory in a new societal setting-Iceland. Specifically, we test the proposition that the effects of economic deprivation on individual outcomes are contingent on: the standard of living enjoyed by the person's reference groups: Using multilevel data on 5,491 Icelandic adolescents in 83 school-communities, we find consistent support for the theory. We show that the effects of economic deprivation on adolescent anger, normlessness, delinquency, violence and subjective relative family status are weak in school-communities where economic deprivation is common, while the effects are significantly stronger in school-communities where economic deprivation is rare.
0	Although several reasons for racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes are citedaccess to health care services, income, health insurance, educationthe process whereby this inequality emerges is not fully understood. There are two main goals of this paper. First, is to further the understanding of these processes by exploring the aspects of the doctor-patient relationship that could contribute to inequality. Second, is to explain disparities by linking empirical literature on the doctor-patient interaction with theoretical literature in social psychology on interaction. Previous research suggests that future research needs to identify and elaborate on the relevant variables associated with racial and ethnic inequality in the doctor-patient interaction so that appropriate policy decisions could be made. Through a systematic review, I reframe the literature by identifying variables that may mediate the relationship between patients and doctors race/ethnicity and health outcomes. The variables I identify in the empirical research include perceptions/satisfaction, symptoms presentation and interpretation, concordance, and trust. I conclude by reflecting on a need for more research on these and other variables, especially qualitative studies on the interaction between doctor and patient.
0	In this paper, I argue that the democracy-mined citizen-professionals who founded and led four key post-9/11 civic renewal organizations that aimed to promote healing and hope by creating real opportunities for citizen participation in rebuilding Lower Manhattan have continued to be motivated by a three-leveled call to leadership; they have been sustained by community fellowship as well as multiple layers of effectiveness of their efforts: civic, professional and personal.   The collective behavior and motivation of the principal leaders of: The Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown for Rebuilding Downtown New York, New York/New Visions, Imagine New York, and Rebuild Downtown New York, started reaching out to their broad network of citizen and professional stakeholders to begin advocating for a voice in the Lower Manhattan healing and rebuilding process shortly after the terrorist attacks on 9/11; each utilizing their formidable civic, professional and personal social capital.  The key leaders of these new civic renewal movements are comprised of individual principal actors who have a highly developed professional orientation and scientific knowledge of the planning, architecture, and legal processes in New York City, in addition to considerable political and economic capital.
0	Past research yields mixed evidence of the racial gap in medical trust and suggests two explanations of black-white differences in trust: (1) racial differences in demographic, political, and religious correlates of trust (Structural), or (2) racial differences in survey response style and underlying skepticism (Cultural). I explore the viability of two other explanations of the racial trust gap: 1) dimension-specific gaps in trust between blacks and whites, or 2) racial variance in the effects of structural, cultural, and temporal correlates of trust. With data from select General Social Surveys, I find no support for structural explanations of blacks distrust in medicine. Instead, in alliance with cultural and dimensionality arguments, black-white differences in medical trust are confined to evaluations of physicians interpersonal competence and confidence in leaders of medicine and are associated with racial differences in trusting most people and 12 other institution. Furthermore, I find strong support for the assertion that the effects of structural, cultural, and temporal correlates of trust operate differently for blacks and whites. I discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the role that collective memories play in a social system structured by race.
1	This article investigates how experiences with public policies affect levels of civic and political engagement among the poor. Studies of ''policy feedback'' investigate policies not just as political outcomes, but also as factors that set political forces in motion and shape political agency. To advance this literature, we take up three outstanding questions related to selection bias, the distinction between universal and targeted programs, and the types of authority relations most likely to foster engagement among the poor. Using a longitudinal dataset from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, which follows a cohort of low-income parents and their newborn children in 20 U.S. cities, we estimate effects associated with three types of means-tested public assistance. We find that these policies' effects are not an illusion created by selection bias; the effects of targeted programs can both promote and discourage engagement; and such effects tend to be more positive when a policy's authority structure reflects democratic rather than paternalist principles.
1	This research examines the gendered nature of cultural legitimacy and consecration in popular music. We explore two related questions. First, which factors affect the likelihood that female performers achieve consecrated status? Second, how are those decisions discursively legitimated? Using a mixed-methods research design, we find that in both direct and indirect ways, gender significantly shapes a performer's likelihood of consecration, leaving female artists at a disadvantage in this process. Moreover, the discursive strategies employed to justify artists' inclusion among the all-time greats are shaped by existing cultural frameworks about art and gender, limiting in more subtle and indirect ways the amount and type of legitimacy that female artists can accrue.
0	This paper focuses on examining ethnic attachment among twice-migrant Chinese and Indians who originated from different Chinese and Indian diasporic communities, using the 2006-2008 American Community Survey.  It has three specific objectives.  First, it intends to provide data on national and regional origins of twice-migrant Chinese and Indian immigrants and their numbers, which will provide a general picture of the global distributions of Chinese and Indian populations.  Second, it will analyze educational levels and self-employment rates among Chinese and Indian twice-migrant groups and their subgroups.  Finally and most significantly, this paper will examine ethnic attachment among Chinese and Indian twice-migrant subgroups.  Use of a language other than English at home (presumably a Chinese or an Indian language) and choice of Chinese or Indian as ancestry were used as proxies of ethnic attachment.  We use cross-tabulation analyses to show the Chinese-Indian ethnic differences and subgroup differences within each group in education, self-employment rates, and the two aforementioned indicators of ethnic attachment.  But we mainly use historical knowledge and theoretical perspectives to explain these ethnic and subgroup differences.
0	American public policy with respect to private corporations is without doubt exceptional.  Scholars from Alexis de Tocqueville to James S. Coleman have noted Americans unusual propensity for associating, or organizing privately, without the assistance of the state.   Most explain this particular feature of American social behavior as the result of either the unique norms and habits of the American people or the absence of state-regulated bodies that might otherwise have performed necessary public functions.  These perspectives overlook the role of corporate law in the history of American associationalism in general and the pre-revolutionary origins of American corporate law in particular.  This paper explores the colonial origins of American corporate law and seeks to relate them to the 19th century proliferation of both for-profit and non-profit private corporations.  Incorporation is, by definition, a legal privilege granted and protected by the state.  Post-colonial American legislatures created the legal norm of freedom of incorporation in light of their forebears frustration with an English system in which corporate charters were rarely granted and in which colonial assemblies right to grant such charters remained ambiguous.  Two brief examples are discussed:  the early colonial struggle to charter Americas first universities and the post-Revolutionary fight over the incorporation of state and national banks.  The former case  the colonial fight over the issuance of college charters, represents a key turning point in the political development of the United States.  In an effort to construct a new explanation of the long-standing differences between American and Canadian political culture, counter-examples from the history of Canadian legal and economic development are discussed as well.
1	This study investigates trends in gender inequality throughout the world Using data encompassing a large majority of the world's population, we examine trends in recent decades for key indicators of gender inequality in education, mortality, political representation and economic activity. We find that gender inequality is declining in virtually, all major domains, that the decline is occurring across diverse religious and cultural traditions, and that population growth is slowing the decline because populations are growing faster in countries where there is the greatest gender inequality.
0	Migraine, for a long time attributed to stress, neuroses or hysteria, is now primarily understood in terms of a malfunctioning brain. In this paper, I draw on ethnographic observations of and interviews with headache doctors to argue that this new commitment to neurobiological explanations of head pain is, in fact, partly motivated by headache doctors’ desire to raise the status of their own specialty. Headache doctors constructed the recent past as a time when patients (especially women) were blamed for causing their headaches, and their suffering was trivialized and stigmatized by its association with weak, difficult or neurotic personality types. They also turned to the prominence of psychosomatic medicine in their recent history to account for what they saw as the problems of “legitimacy” that continue to dog their field, making headache medicine a low-status field in the otherwise high-status specialty of neurology. As a result, headache doctors have pinned their hopes of breakthroughs in both treatment and in the status of their field on their new emphasis on the biology of the brain.
0	Our research examines whether contemporaneous consecration in the form international film festivals recognition affects the retrospective cultural consecration of British films by the British Film Institute (bfi). Consecration occurs both contemporaneously and retrospectively, and previous research has found that contemporaneous consecration in the form of popular, professional, and critical recognition affects retrospective consecration (Allen & Lincoln, 2004). We propose a new form of contemporaneous recognition international film festival recognition and argue that retrospective consecration occurs in two forms: primary (bfi 309) and secondary stages (bfi 100). Further, we propose that the primary stage is guided by an expert based selection system, and the secondary stage is guided by a professional based selection system. Our findings show that the age of a film has negative effects on the odds of retrospective consecration by bfi 309, and not bfi 100, suggesting that experts prefer older films than industry professionals. And all three forms of contemporaneous recognition including international film festival recognition, positively affect the odds of retrospective consecration by bfi 309. Whereas, this effect is absent from the retrospective consecration by bfi 100, suggesting that the nature of selection system  professional or expert based determines which form of contemporaneous recognition will affect retrospective consecration.
1	In recent years there has been a growing call to historicize sociology by paying more attention to the contextual importance of time and place as well as to issues of process and contingency. Meeting this goal requires bringing historical sociology and interactionism into greater conversation via a historical theory of social situations. Toward this end, the authors of this article draw on Erving Goffman's work in Frame Analysis to conceptualize experience in social situations as grounded in multilayered cognitive frames and to demonstrate how such a framework helps illuminate historical changes in situated interaction.
0	This project examines the media’s role in covering Chicago’s Plan for Transformation.  For social movement organizations struggling to mobilize popular support to their cause, the media represents a double-edge sword.  While research shows that favorable media coverage of a movement can lead to positive outcomes, the local press may not always present the movement positively.  While studies have explored many types of social movement conflicts, we have relatively little evidence which speaks to the media’s role in covering urban redevelopment disputes.  I attempt to fill this hole in the literature by examining the most radical effort to reform public housing into mixed-income communities to date, Chicago’s Plan for Transformation.  Utilizing newspaper data gathered from the Chicago Tribune archives, I determine that coverage of the case was skewed towards the pro-development side, both in balance and valence.  These results suggest that local resident groups must aggressively engage the media, because the coverage is unlikely to be fair and balanced.  I conclude with suggestions for further research into this topic.
1	This article analyzes the effect of three aspects of physical attractiveness (facial attractiveness, Body Mass Index and height) on socio-economic and marital success over the life course. In a sample of high school graduates from Wisconsin followed from their late teens and until their mid-60s, I find that (1. taller men have higher earnings than shorter men throughout their careers, (2. women with more attractive faces and women with lower Body Mass Index have higher socio-economic status late in their careers, (3. men and women with more attractive faces are more likely to be married in youth, and (4. men and women's physical attractiveness is unrelated to the income and socio-economic status of their spouses. These results suggest that, first, physical attractiveness matters throughout the life course, second, attractiveness does not have a large quantitative effect on socio-economic and marital outcomes and third, different aspects of physical attractiveness matter differently for men and women.
1	Unable to make individuals pay for services, many Voluntary organizations are burdened with members paying little or nothing for their involvement. An extensive research literature has argued that demanding religious congregations increase organizational resources by screening out free-riders. This explanation focuses oil membership selection and the effect of individual beliefs and commitment. Building on the implications of previous Work we argue that congregational requirements do more than just screen-out the least committed; they also serve to increase the production of those who join. Using multi-level data we find that organizational monitoring and sanctioning interact with individual beliefs and involvement to explain financial giving to religious congregations. We Conclude that high organizational demands not only serve to select members who are the most willing to give, they generate organizational properties that increase the contributions of those who join. In short, sanctions ensure that individuals do not believe without contributing, while monitoring ensures that individuals do not participate without contributing. 
0	In her seminal work Purity and Danger, Mary Douglas (1966:160) argues, Where there is no differentiation there is no defilement.  Thus, without boundaries, we would not have any basis on which to judge, label, and stigmatize.  While generally symbolic in nature, as there is rarely a tangible line denoting where divisions lie, boundaries are fundamentally responsible for defining our social worlds, and are a necessary focus for any work exploring how we form and perceive daily interactions and stigma.   Throughout this paper I explore the boundary between fat and thin which has great consequences for those who are defined as (or define themselves as) being on the so-called wrong side of the fat line.  More specifically, I focus on what messages make fat meaningful to fat people by analyzing twenty in-depth interviews.  My findings show that both the medical community and the fashion industry are responsible for boundary drawing.  It is also clear that social processes define what is fat and what is not, and we are all, at least to some extent, vulnerable to them.  However, what particular messages affect fat people the most depends upon where they are in the life course, and their specific day-to-day experiences.

I argue that to fully understand the history of medicine and medical practice in India, one needs to look, not only at the clinic or the hospital, but the household. The household, in its real (architectural spaces, household commodities, medicines/drugs) and symbolic (representing hierarchies like for instance spaces for women/men, purity/impurity, exteriority/interiority, and those based on seniority) manifestations became the most important site for the emergence of an ethic of well being, which, though it evolved in the context of colonial/western ideologies, institutions, and spaces, and in a dialogue with them,was nonetheless based on a rationale, ingredients of which were already present in Bengali cultural repertoire. In this paper I have tried to show how these concepts interacted with those, which were labeled westernand gave rise to new forms of hygienic and health practices. I analyze two particular concepts like ""care"" and ""cleanliness"" as they exist in contemporary Bengali socio-cultural vocabulary and argue that these concepts helped create new modular forms of hygiene, health, and well-being, which were imagined as part of a nationalist discourse."
0	Sociologists have long been concerned with how groups divide labor and the consequences of these divisions.  This project extends sociological examination into hospice, a workplace with a cooperative division of labor, by empirically documenting who is advantaged and disadvantaged within negotiations over the assignment of tasks. Assessments of hospice have found that the cooperative model is good for patient outcomes, but less is known about how it affects workers.  Through over two years participant observation and 33 semi-structured interviews with hospice workers, I found that this model often includes unintended negative consequences for workers.  These include an unequal division of administrative and emotional labor and the exclusion of some staff members, creating frustration and the potential for conflict.
1	Literature examining political framing generally focuses on the way that shared framing leads to cohesive actions and policy outcomes. Using a case study of San Francisco's homeless policy field, this article shows that shared framings among the majority of actors in the policy field did not lead to cooperative alliance among those actors nor to coherent policy based on their shared framing. To understand why shared framing failed, I examine the complex interaction between frames, influence, and material resources. While the center and the left of the policy field shared common diagnostic framings and solution-oriented prognostic framings of homelessness, the right possessed far superior material resources and political influence compared to the left. The center and left divided over different tactical prognostic framings about how to politically relate to the resources and influence of the right. These internal dynamics of the field were further amplified by the field's local institutional and national policy-making contexts. This article adds to understandings of how to map political fields, how ideas shape policy outcomes, and how meaning and materiality interact in the process of politics. Keywords: framing, policy, fields, networks, homelessness.
1	"Environmental justice scholars have suggested that because chemical plants and other hazardous facilities emit more pollutants where they face the least resistance, disadvantaged communities face a special health risk. In trying to determine whether race or income has the bigger impact on a neighborhood's exposure to pollution, however, scholars tend to overlook the facilities themselves and the effect of their characteristics on emissions. In particular, how do the characteristics of facilities and their surrounding communities jointly shape pollution outcomes? We propose a new line of environmental justice research that focuses on facilities and how their features combine with communities' features to create dangerous emissions. Using novel fuzzy-set analysis techniques and the EPA's newly developed Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators, we test the influence of facility and community factors on chemical plants' health-threatening emissions. Contrary to the idea that community characteristics have singular, linear effects, findings show that facility and community factors combine in a variety of ways to produce risky emissions. We speculate that as chemical firms experiment with different ways of producing goods and externalizing pollution costs, new ""recipes of risk'' are likely to emerge. The question, then, will no longer be whether race or income matters most, but in which of these recipes do they matter and how."
1	Student level data on participation in classroom discourse and student effort on assignments in 117 middle school English classrooms are used to investigate the social determinants of student engagement in classroom instruction. Social identity theories of race, social class, and attachment to school, and research in the social psychology of achievement motivation both suggest differential levels of student engagement among diverse student groups. Using multilevel models, the author investigates the relationship between classroom context and students' levels of engagement. Levels of engagement among black and low SES students are mostly insensitive to classroom context, suggesting there is little collective action directed at fostering anti-school norms among these student groups. However, consistent with research in the social psychology of achievement motivation, students who begin class with weaker reading and writing skills are less likely to be engaged, setting the stage for a cycle of reduced achievement growth.

The National Lawyers Guild, drawing on 35 years of observation of First Amendment activity, concludes that post-Seattle protest policing manifests a noticeable shift from reactive law enforcement to preemptive law enforcement. Global justice activism is operationalized here to include: opposition to the international institutions such as the World Bank and WTO, anti-corporate campaigns associated with the anti-globalization movement, and movements which predate this movement but have become involved with it. The criminal justice system is operationalized here to include relevant laws, policing, investigation, prosecution, defense of activists, and lawsuits fighting back on all these aspects of the law (political litigation). Obviously this is a lot of territory to cover, and this article aims to simply describe the landscape, laying the groundwork for future analyses of each area in the above list.
1	Numerous studies have noted the increasing levels of inequality in American society but relatively few have linked this inequality to the dynamics of the global economy In this study we examine the impact of five measures of globalization (global capital, foreign direct investment exports, foreign born non-citizens and foreign born citizens) and six measures of labor market transformation (deindustrialization, corporate restructuring bureaucratic burden casualization, bad jobs and multiple job holding) on metropolitan-level earnings inequality of full-time full-year workers 16 years and older Our study makes several major contributions to the literature First we update and extend the long line of studies on metropolitan earnings inequality Second we show that these various dimensions of globalization and labor market transformation exert independent and mainly polarizing effects on the earnings distributions of metropolitan areas net of controls for labor market structure and sociodemographic variables Third we demonstrate the benefits of looking at the causes of inequality in the upper and lower tails of the earnings distribution Finally we develop a procedure to estimate counterfactual values of earnings inequality for all major metropolitan areas in the US in 2000 In the process, the paper provides a comprehensive accounting of the impact of globalization and labor market transformation on metropolitan earnings inequality 
1	The census tract-based residential segregation literature rests on problematic assumptions about geographic scale and proximity. We pursue a new tract-free approach that combines explicitly spatial concepts and methods to examine racial segregation across egocentric local environments of varying size. Using 2000 Census data for the 100 largest US. metropolitan areas, we compute a spatially modified version of the information theory index H to describe patterns of Black-White, Hispanic-White, Asian-White, and multigroup segregation at different scales. We identify the metropolitan structural characteristics that best distinguish micro-segregation from macro-segregation for each group combination, and we decompose their effects into portions due to racial variation occurring over short and long distances. A comparison of our results with those from tract-based analyses confirms the value of the new approach.
0	This paper draws on longitudinal interview research among persons living in transitional housing programs in Tokyo and Los Angeles to explore how experiences of the stigma of homelessness are shaped culturally. I find that a stronger stigma of homelessness in Japan combines with generational factors and rigid gender norms (the “male breadwinner” role) to prevent individuals experiencing homelessness to turn to friends and family for assistance in trying to exit homelessness. Also, the stigma of place in terms of residence in a program for the homeless serves as a greater barrier to employment in Tokyo. While drawing on familial and friendship ties is a primary means to exit homelessness in Los Angeles, in Tokyo individuals most often fend for themselves in the low-wage labor market. This renders exits more tenuous there given unstable work and a lack of social support. This comparative analysis contributes to the study of culture and poverty by demonstrating how stigma attached to disadvantaged statuses can vary across cultures via how it affects access to social capital and employment. It also informs urban sociology by bringing to the fore the role of culture in shaping local manifestations of inequality amid globalization, and highlighting how the stigma of place can vary according to locale. Last, it criticizes studies of homelessness by demonstrating that efforts to exit homelessness represent the major focus in addressing stigma of the condition rather than more accommodative management strategies.
0	Because a large percentage of professional and college athletes are African American and they are especially prevalent in media coverage of sports, larger societal discourses on race are readily incorporated into discourses specifically associated with sport and athletes. While this work is important, it overlooks the contribution of other key participants in sport as a social institution, such as journalists, sport franchise executives, and coaches, all of whom contribute to the creation of a sporting event.  The role of coaches has become especially relevant in recent years as sports teams and leagues have begun to address the lack of African Americans in sport leadership positions.  Our paper seeks to address this gap in the research by systematically analyzing the representation of African American college basketball head coaches in the 2003 National Collegiate Athletic Association mens basketball tournament.  Using qualitative and quantitative analytical methods  content analysis and multinomial logistic regression  we consider how media discourse about African American coaches differs from the discourse about African American athletes.  We demonstrate this in two ways:  first, we show that African American coaches are indeed subject to different discursive frames than their white counterparts; and, second, that media discourse associated with the representation of Black coaches is comprised of several differing discourses employed by the creators of televised sports broadcasts as they construct the broader narrative of sport.  These coach-specific discourses, we find, draw upon a complex construction of talent and experience, thereby racializing Black coaches sports competence in unexpected ways.
0	Using samples drawn from census data by the University of Minnesota Social History Research Laboratorys Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (hereafter IPUMS), we examine recent trends in African-American migration to the South across several decades, and explore the applicability of the concept of return migration to various demographic patterns.   Specifically, we examine (1) the personal characteristics of those who have been changing their regional residences, (2) the Southern destinations to which African-Americans have been moving in recent decades, and (3) the interactions between personal characteristics and factors of place in determining migration pattern.  Our findings suggest that the recent return movement is complex in its demography, containing multiple migration streams, and resulting in the establishment of different kinds of residential patterns by migrant populations defined by distinctive socio-demographic characteristics.  That this population shift includes people with higher socio-economic status (compared with both origin and destination populations), and involves both urban and rural destinations, are some key differences compared to the earlier 20th centurys Great Migration of African-Americans from South to North.   These new population dynamics (1) suggest that the South may be replacing the North as a land of promise for some upwardly mobile African-Americans and (2) may also reflect what Carol Stack (1996) has termed a call to home as a  motivating factor shaping the return movement to the South.
1	Previous research suggests that when there is a high level of inequality, there is a low rate of participation. Two arguments are generally offered: First, inequality depresses participation because people from different status groups have fewer opportunities to share common goals. Second, people may participate more in civic and social life when they have more resources. However: until now, these explanations have not been separated empirically. Using EU-SILC data for 24 European countries, we analyze how income inequality is related to civic and social participation. Our results indicate that the main effects of inequality manifest via resources at the individual and societal level. However, independent of these resources, higher inequality is associated with lower civic participation. Furthermore, inequality magnifies the relationship between income and participation. This finding is in line with the view that inter-individual processes explain why inequality diminishes participation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	Since the late 1980s there has been a surge in minority rights policies across Europe.  In this paper, I test three hypotheses about what causes this increase in minority rights protection: 1) the increasing emphasis on minority rights in intergovernmental organizations such as the European Union, 2) the occurrence of political opportunities such as the ending of communism and the beginning of democracy in many states, or 3) the varying size in minority and immigrant populations in different countries.  I find that the European Union has had the greatest effect on increasing minority rights policies, but the other factors also have impact in some cases.
0	The purpose of this article is to look at how age affects the relationship between perceptions of other peoples alcohol use and their own personal consumption of alcohol.  Examining college and non-college students between the ages of 18 and 26, we explore the age structure of perceptions of other peoples use of alcohol and how they are linked to actual drinking behaviors among these different age cohorts of young adults.  The data used for this study comes from the Community Alcohol and Drug Survey of Young Adults which collected information on drinking and drug use among college age students at four colleges and their surrounding communities in the state of New York (n=545).  The analysis of the respondents revealed that drinking behaviors and perceptions are linked across different age cohorts.  Age groups with lower consumption of alcohol per week were also shown to have lower perceptions of others consumption of alcohol per week.  Moreover, age groups with higher consumption of alcohol per week were also shown to have higher perceptions of others consumption of alcohol per week.  Further analysis revealed that the relationship between peoples perceptions of college students drinking behaviors and their own drinking behavior was  strongest among the youngest age cohorts (18 and 19), while older age cohorts had weaker (20 to 22) or no relationship at all (23 to 26).  Peoples perceptions of their friends drinking behavior and their own revealed a consistent positive relationship across age cohorts.  A discussion of the results suggest that perceptions of other college students drinking behaviors has more of an impact on newly arriving college students drinking behavior that diminishes as they become older within these campuses and surrounding communities.
0	The purpose of clinical research is to create the scientific foundation for medical practice.  In this way of thinking, the effect on medical practice occurs after the research has been completed.  Drawing on research in HIV clinics, we argue that some of the effect in fact occurs before the completion of research.  Although research findings may influence medical practice, the practice of research also shapes the practice of medicine.  We argue that clinical trials shape medical practice largely by altering the organizations in which both medical treatment and clinical trials take place and explain how this transformation occurs.
1	"After becoming consistently more egalitarian for more than two decades, gender role attitudes in the General Social Survey have changed little since the mid-1990s. This plateau mirrors other gender trends, suggesting a fundamental alteration in the momentum toward gender equality. While cohort replacement can explain about half of the increasing egalitarianism between 1974 and 1994, the changes since the mid-1990s are not well accounted for by cohort differences. Nor is the post-1994 stagnation explained by structural or broad ideological changes in American society. The recent lack of change in gender attitudes is more likely the consequence of the rise of a new cultural frame, an ""egalitarian essentialism"" that blends aspects of feminist equality and traditional motherhood roles."
0	This study explores preferences for working time and family time among employees in Japan. Although recent studies show that an increasing number of Japanese men and women feel it is important to strike balance between work, family and leisure, two questions still remain: To what extent do Japanese prefer reducing the time they allocate to work, while spending more time with family? How do Japanese want to integrate work and life over life course? An analysis of data collected among 3800 automotive workers in Japan show that the majority of workers, regardless of their age and job type, prefer that they proportionately allocate their time to work and non-work domains of life. Yet, many of the respondents still espouse the traditional male model of occupational career, in which the same proportion of time is constantly allocated to paid work across all stages of life. Results indicate that Japanese workers, in general, feel it is important that they strike balance between employment and their life outside of it. But at the same time they show a strong preference for working constantly without any major career disruptions between ages 20 and 60, then reducing drastically work time after job retirement at age 60.
0	This paper argues for the addition of culture and cultural affinity to identity vs. practice debates in the sociology of sexualities.  Drawing on data from an online community in which straight-identified men solicit sexual encounters with other men, I discuss the tendency within queer scholarship to invoke theories of the closet as a means of owning all forms of same-sex sexuality.  In contrast, this paper argues for the theoretical and political importance of disowning some forms of same-sex sexuality, or reading them as authentic expressions of heterosexuality.   Introducing the concept of dude-sex, I examine the relationship between dude-sex and gay men, and the role of women in dude-sex.  I find that in this online community, neither sex itself nor the self-identifications of the men who post there are useful guides for delineating the boundaries of queer and non-queer, or concomitantly, establishing political alliances with queer stakeholders.  Instead, I argue that shared cultureincluding aesthetic preferences, a sense of collective identity, and participation in a community of resistancemay better help us determine who we own as queer scholars and activists.
0	This paper offers an interpretation of cryonic suspension (“cryonics”), the practice of freezing human corpses in the hope that scientists will at some future point achieve the technology necessary to facilitate “reanimation.”  Employing methods of historical-archival research, I interpret a host of materials ranging in date from the early 1960s to 2005, many of which are quite obscure, and which at the time of this writing have not been utilized for purposes of sociohistorical inquiry.   Reconstructing the  circumstances that provided the necessary conditions of possibility for the emergence of cryonics in the American 1960s, I demonstrate that the practice’s historical forebears reside in the “suspended animation” techniques conceived by NASA scientists and engineers during the height of the space race, as “cyborg solutions” to the problems of interplanetary human spaceflight.  I then provide an account of how these techniques as well as cyborg analogies and metaphors were appropriated by the lay-scientific progenitors of cryonics, recounting the disastrous consequences that resulted from their uncoupling of the techniques from the institutional context of aerospace technoscience, and from their disregard for mainstream scientific conventions generally.  While a highly impractical and “fringe” practice, I conclude by arguing that cryonics should nevertheless be taken seriously given what it reveals about the tumultuous cultural climate and sociohistorical conditions in which it emerged, the history of the cyborg and cybernetics, and lastly, contemporary discourses on life extension technologies, transhumanism, and technological utopianism generally.
1	Using complete census tract, county, and PMSA analog data with longitudinally fixed (standardized) boundaries for the entire United States in 1980, 1990, and 2000, we investigate potential homogenizing trends within spatial areas hypothesized by Massey and others but contradicted by the theorizing of Florida and others. The results for seven socio-demographic variables show a trend toward increasing similarity in the majority of socio-demographic variables in all types of spatial units examined. However, we observe increasing heterogeneity in some conditions and for some variables, particularly racial/ethnic characteristics and family structure. These findings are consistent with the collective body of prior evidence based on less comprehensive data, suggesting that theories of social change and spatial characteristics may benefit from some degree of theoretical integration in which the circumstances under which homogenization or heterogenization may be most likely are better specified theoretically. 
0	In this paper, I challenge the assumption of urban regime theory that growth machine activity represents an intrinsically determined elite response to the political economy of post-Fordist regional development.  By describing a case of a machine-style elite coalition dedicated to promoting regional land conservation, I probe regime theorys utility for understanding activity not oriented towards the territorial ideology of growth.  Through intensive interviewing and analysis of newspaper coverage, I illustrate that the conservation machine behaves like a typical growth machine, with the same coalition members, backstage practices, and regional competition.  Urban regime theory is a useful tool for understanding this activity but requires revision in terms of the potential ends that regime activity is presumed to serve: private accumulation in one case, and public and ecological benefits in the other.  While perhaps only an exception, the conservation machines existence forces a reevaluation of the underlying moral claims of regime theorists.
1	We draw upon data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study to examine the effect of neighborhood socioeconomic composition on two key economic outcomes, and in doing so to test the validity of the index of concentration at the extremes (ICE) as a measure of neighborhood circumstances. Methodologically, we find that the index succinctly captures economic variation within neighborhoods in a way that avoids problems of colinearity that have characterized prior studies. Neighborhoods can be characterized as failing on a continuum ranging from concentrated disadvantage to concentrated advantage; the ICE measure does a good job capturing this variation and differentiating the neighborhood circumstances experienced by different groups. Substantively, we show that neighborhood economic circumstances are related to new mothers' welfare use and employment, above and beyond their individual socioeconomic characteristics.

0	Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is a snowball-type sampling method used to survey hidden populations.  To date, analyses of RDS data have primarily consisted of estimating population proportions and their variance because of the special complexities RDS data pose for regression analysis.  This paper discusses those complications, focusing on the role of homophily (differential affiliation) in the recruitment process and respondent clustering at multiple potential levels of aggregation.  It proposes two techniques for confronting these problems: entering recruiter characteristics directly into recruit-level regression models and estimating fixed- or random-effects models at the levels where significant clustering is observed.  An empirical example demonstrates the modeling process, and a six-step procedure for regression modeling of RDS data is presented.
1	Over the last two decades, the Internet has changed various facets of social life, creating many social concerns. To better assess the impact of the Internet, it is important to understand the pattern of its diffusion. Using the Current Population Survey, this paper examines the diffusion process of the Internet between 1994 and 2007. The CPS provides seven cross-sectional data sets on Internet use over the period, four of which are spaced close enough to be turned into panel data sets. Simple trend analyses show that a logistic S-curve fits the seven observations very well, and that the diffusion took off around the time when the graphical user interface was introduced. Findings from multivariate trend analyses and panel data analyses include; (1) the digital divide is not likely to be closed in the near future, (2) exposure to the technology at school and workplace are important factors of initial and continued use of the Internet, and (3) of different online activities, email use is the most important predictor of continued use, implying that the diffusion process is highly social, rather than individualistic. 
1	"This research addresses a long standing puzzle in the social sciences: why are stratified social systems accepted as legitimate (the way things ""ought"" to be) by those who are advantaged and those who are disadvantaged by them? We build on previous studies of self-evaluations to explain the legitimation of inequality. The research consists of two experiments designed to test the self-evaluation theory of legitimacy. The theory proposes that structural inequality becomes legitimated when individuals' self-evaluations and the level of resources they receive are congruent. Study I examines the impact of structural power on self-evaluations. Results show that participants randomly assigned to advantaged positions in power structures earn more rewards and, as a result, develop higher self-evaluations than those randomly assigned to disadvantaged positions. Study 2 addresses the relationship between self-evaluations and legitimated structural inequality by testing competing hypotheses of legitimacy. The results partially support the self-evaluation theory and partially support competing arguments about legitimacy. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our work and suggestions for future research. "
0	This article examines whether and to what extent transitional justice has emerged in the past decade as a transnational social movement. Bringing together the literature on transitional justice with the literature on transnational collective action, it provides both a preliminary analysis of the nature of the shared identity and coordinated action around transitional justice.  Drawing from an empirical study of actors who mobilize around transitional justice mechanisms and processes, the findings leave open the question as to whether and to what extent transitional justice is a transnational social movement but reveals an increasing level of professionalization in the shared identity and skepticism about the coordinated action. The study suggests that there will be ongoing contestation over what actors mobilizing around transitional justice can and should do to meet their varied and critical goals.
1	Using longitudinal data from 769 white adolescents in the Midwest, this research applies a social structure and personality perspective to examine variation in self-esteem and mastery trajectories by gender and SES across the high school years. Analyses reveal that high SES adolescents experience significantly steeper gains in self-esteem and mastery compared to low SES adolescents, resulting in the reversal of SES differences in self-esteem and the emergence of significant SES differences in mastery. Pre-existing gender differences in self-esteem narrow between the 9th and 12th grade because self-esteem increases at a faster rate among girls than boys during high school. These SES and gender differences in self-concept growth are explained by changes in parent-adolescent relationship quality and stress exposure. Specifically, boys and adolescents with lower SES backgrounds experienced steeper declines in parent-adolescent relationship quality and steeper gains in chronic work strain compared to girls and low SES adolescents, respectively. 
1	"Previous research identifies changing world cultural norms as the impetus for a worldwide trend promoting environmentalism. However, the extent to which countries comply with the norms promoted and codified by environmental organizations and treaties has been less rigorously tested. Suspected noncompliance is generally explained as ""decoupling"" between policy and outcome. Here, I address the relationship between stated environmental objectives and practices and integrate world society and world-systems perspectives on the natural environment. Using random effects regression analyses of cross-national chemical fertilizer and pesticide use, I find that integration into world culture significantly predicts overall decreased use of these environmentally harmful products. However, the effect varies by zone of the world system, which supports an integrated theory of global environmentalism."
1	Most studies of rape-law reform outcomes focus on single cases. We advance this literature by studying outcomes more systematically-leveraging new cross-national and longitudinal reform data-and showing that reform outcomes have both global and national determinants. Our exploratory analyses show three main findings: (1) Rape-law reforms are strongly associated with elevated police reporting between 1945 and 2005. (2) The strength of the association depends on domestic contexts. The association is stronger in countries characterized by individualism, women mobilization, wealth, and education; it is weaker in countries with greater democracy and police strength. (3) The strength of the association also depends on global contexts. It is stronger in countries with dense linkages to world society and weaker under conditions of global institutionalization, as widespread diffusion gives rise to both ceremony without substance (i.e., domestic rape-law reforms without subsequent increases in reporting) and substance without ceremony (increased police reporting without antecedent reforms). In multivariate regression analyses, rape-law reforms, women mobilization, and links, to world society all have positive and significant effects on police reporting. It appears that both global and domestic contexts-together and independently-importantly shape policy and practice.
1	This research focuses on immigration and youthful illegalities in the Toronto area, one of the world's most ethnically diverse global cities. While current research documents a negative relationship between crime and immigration, there is little attention to individual-level mechanisms that explain the paths through which immigrant youth refrain from illegalities. Through a study of two cohorts of adolescents across two generations (1976, 1999), we elaborate a process model that is generic over both generations, and in which measures of bonds to parents and schools, commitments to education, and dispositions of risk aversity mediate youth involvement in illegalities. By focusing on a period when non-European immigration to Toronto increased dramatically, we then identify a compositional effect through which the more recent cohort is engaged in fewer illegalities.
1	"Many scholars and policy makers of education have focused significant attention on male advantages in math skills during adolescence, but have often overlooked female advantages in math skills that emerge before school begins. As a way to explain this conflicting pattern, some scholars cite exposure to schooling as a reason why girls experience what some have termed girls' ""reversal of fortunes."" By using first-of-its-kind data I examine math-related skills with proscriptive data from early to late childhood using two nationally-representative data sets. Moving beyond standardized assessments of math skills, this study reconciles these two competing trends using subset measures. Far from a reversal of fortunes, girls excel in math skills that are less complex (i.e. counting, shape recognition) across childhood. Girls' disadvantages in math emerge with content change-as item complexity increases over time (i.e. multiplication, division, and fractions). In contrast to standardized assessments of cognitive skills, gender gaps in item complexity may be more revealing for understanding the origins and development of gender stratification. "
1	A long-standing debate questions whether homemakers or working wives are happier. Drawing on cross-national data for 28 countries, this research uses multi-level models to provide fresh evidence on this controversy. All things considered, homemakers are slightly happier than wives who work fulltime, but they have no advantage over part-time workers. The work status gap in happiness persists even controlling for family life mediators. Cross-level interactions between work status and macro-level variables suggest that country characteristics-GDP, social spending, women's labor force participation, liberal gender ideology and public child care-ameliorate the disadvantage in happiness for full-time working wives compared to homemakers and part-time workers.
1	Strategic and tactical planning for military intervention needs revision as the causes, methods, and means of conflict have evolved. Counter-insurgent engagement is one such intervention that governments, militaries, and non-governmental organizations seek to better understand. Modeling insurgencies is an acceptable means to gain insight into the various characteristics of asymmetric warfare to proffer prescriptive resolutions for mitigating their effects. Colombia's insurgency poses the challenge of assessing population behavior in a non-traditional revolutionary climate. Factors prevalent in traditional insurgency are not applicable in Colombia, specifically between the years 1993 and 2001 with the democratization of the drug cartels. The catastrophic events of September 11th reverberated in Colombia resulting in a new policy and strategy to the waging the counter-insurgency there. This research introduces a structured methodology to modeling the Colombian counter-insurgency incorporating qualitative assessment, mathematical representation, and a System Dynamics approach to represent the effects of the policy change. 
1	The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program offered public housing residents in distressed communities a chance to move to low-poverty neighborhoods. The present study examined whether the resulting decline in neighborhood poverty led to lower levels of exposure to danger among children and youth ages 8-19 years old (n = 4606), and specifically, if there was a gender difference that matched the pattern of more beneficial program effects for girls and more adverse affects for boys. The study goes beyond previous research by using fixed effects to control for family factors that may influence moving behavior and confound estimates of gender differences in program impacts. Results showed that children experienced a decline in exposure to danger, with one key gender difference. Models based on brother-sister comparisons indicated that MTO had a more beneficial impact on exposure to drug activity for females than males. The findings suggest that neighborhood poverty is tied to children's exposure to danger. Moreover, exposure to drug activity may help explain the gender differences in impacts on children's mental health and risky behavior. 
0	This project examines state-making, economic forms and collective action in the Ottoman middle eastern frontier. In the first part, I explore the negotiated character of Ottoman state consolidation where basic administrative centralization clashed with religious trust networks and geopolitical rivalry. In the second part, my argument underlines protection rents as the basis of economic survival, which in turn limited the expansion of domestic and foreign markets. Finally, benefiting from contentious politics literature in historical sociology, I trace the repertoires of claim-making in the frontier: rebellions, revolts and inter-communal violence.
0	The hegemony of neoliberalism is commonly seen as having a right-wing origin and identity. However, the focus on its right-wing origins and identity gives too much credence to the effectiveness of right-wing activists to realize their hegemonic projects and has not helped us to understand the mechanisms that led to the globalization of neoliberalism. I use the case of the Center for the Study of Economic and Society Problems (CESES) located in Milan, Italy, which had all the external signs of a right-wing think tank. However, due to the difficulties of discussing communism across Cold War boundaries, individuals identified with the left were the most numerous and often most successful participants in these discussions. The changing nature of the Cold War terrain and Sovietology produced liminal individuals, institutions, and ideas. Helped by the structural shift of 1989 that meant the disappearance of Soviet communism, the liminal space between communism and capitalism, and the mediators that helped to effect this shift, right-wing activists in the neoliberal network could post hoc redefine the network as having been right-wing all along and reassert clear boundaries between left and right, Soviet socialism and Western capitalism.
0	Immigration to the United States continues to be an issue of enormous interest and concern.  Since amendments to the McCarran-Walter Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965, immigrants have  entered the U.S. steadily, without suspension.  This uninterrupted flow has been referred to as immigrant replenishment (Jimenez, 2008; Waters & Jimenez, 2005).  Though much recent research draws attention to the fact that national origins are now predominantly from Asia and Latin American—as opposed to the prominence of European origins during the dawning of the 20th century— (see Massey, 1995; Portes & Rumbaut, 2006; Portes & MacLeod, 1996; Rumbaut, 1994; Zhou & Bankston, 1997) a pressing issue of notable significance is the near constant stream of migration into the U.S.. The continual arrival of immigrants today introduces a new level of complexity to understanding immigration, and its effects on society.  Immigrant replenishment has great implications for incorporation and assimilation. It influences racial and ethnic identity formation (Jimenez, 2008) as well as the prevalence of bilingualism (Linton & Jimenez 2009).  It also has potential to produce divisions and conflict between more established and recent waves (see Erdmans, 1995). This paper addresses the issue of immigrant replenishment by providing a profile of immigration from Arabic-speaking countries over three decades.  Attention to migration patterns by country of origin, demographic characteristics and settlement patterns, as well as structural and cultural assimilation are examined from the last three decennial censuses (1980, 1990, 2000).
1	Research links sex ratios with the likelihood of marriage and divorce. However, whether sex ratios similarly influence precursors to marriage (transitions in and out of dating or cohabiting relationships) is unknown. Utilizing data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study and the 2000 U.S. Census, this study assesses whether sex ratios influence the formation and stability of emerging adults' romantic relationships. Findings show that relationship formation is unaffected by partner availability, yet the presence of partners increases women's odds of cohabiting, decreases men's odds of cohabiting, and increases number of dating partners and cheating among men. It appears that sex ratios influence not only transitions in and out of marriage, but also the process through which individuals search for and evaluate partners prior to marriage.
1	"This study uses an affect theory of social exchange (Lawler 2001) to investigate how and when network structures generate ""micro social orders."" Micro social order entails recurrent interactions, emotional reactions, perceptions of a group, and affective sentiments. The core theoretical argument is that micro orders, involving behavioral, cognitive, and affective dimensions, develop and are stronger to the degree that (1) actors engage in highly joint tasks or activities and (2) these tasks generate a sense of shared responsibility for the interaction outcomes. A laboratory experiment varies different forms of social exchange-negotiated, reciprocal, generalized, and productive within a network structure, and offers strong support for the core expectation that productive forms of exchange generate the strongest micro order Conversely, generalized exchange generates the weakest order with negotiated and reciprocal forms in between. In general, productive exchange bolsters more exchange behavior more positive feelings, perceptions of cohesion at the network level, and affective attachments to the network as a social unit. This research has broad implications for the conditions under which task activity promotes micro social orders that involve strong person-to-group ties (as opposed to person-to-person ties) and affective sentiments regarding the social unit."
0	Theorists contend that post-industrial economies have relatively high inequality because dichotomies develop between manufacturing and service employment, and between knowledge-intensive and labor-intensive service employment.  Researcheres have tested the association between post-industrialization and inequality at the aggregate level, but they have not tested the specific hypotheses regarding who benefits within a post-industrial economy.  Utilizing the 2002 Current Population Survey, we build on this research by testing the effect of service sector employment and the size of the producer services sector on individuals wage and salary income in metropolitan statistical areas.
0	In this paper I summarize data accumulated after 4 months of ethnographic research at a local public television station.  Using the production of culture (Becker, 1982) perspective, routinization (DiMaggio and Hirsch, 1976) I discuss how a local public television station obtains its resources necessary for the organization to carry out its programming goals.  Using this process of resource accumulation, I then discuss how public television attempts to instill a collective identity among its viewers.  Finally, I describe how the process of obtaining resources and promoting a collective identity among viewer reflects an exercise in hegemony.
1	Why are some civic associations more effective than others? The authors introduce a multidimensional framework for analyzing the effectiveness of civic associations in terms of public recognition, member engagement, and leader development. Using original surveys of local Sierra Club organizations and leaders, the authors assess prevailing explanations in organization and movement studies alongside a model highlighting leadership and internal organizational practices. Although available resources and favorable contexts matter, the core findings show that associations with more committed activists, that build organizational capacity, that carry out strong programmatic activity, and whose leaders work independently, generate greater effectiveness across outcomes.
0	This exploratory research is a feminist-informed micro-sociological study of frontline welfare workers accounts of the everyday work practices they employ to collaboratively construct and present client compliance.  I attend to the way that institutional order is maintained within the disciplinary domain of power.  At the same time, I consider the ways in which these workers engage in resistance within the interpersonal domain of power, and consider the implications for the hegemonic domain.
1	Researchers have explored the considerable negative effect of an individual's or his spouse's poor health on their wealth accumulation. Health selection may also operate across generations, affecting the wealth of children whose parents suffer from poor health. We develop an intergenerational model of health selection in wealth using life course theory to understand whether parents' non-fatal serious health events affect inter vivos financial transfers to children. First, we estimate the relationship between parents' serious health events in adulthood and wealth accumulation, showing that data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study reproduce results from research using U.S. national panel studies and supporting the generalizability of our intergenerational health selection results. Second, we find strong evidence of intergenerational health selection. Individuals with less initial wealth and who experience a serious health event are about 34% more likely to transfer money to their children and transfer 60% more money to their children when they do. 
1	To successfully resettle 1 27 million Chinese for the construction of the Three Gorges Project (TGP) the Chinese government employed a new re-resettlement policy which emphasizes infrastructural development of the resettlement sites to assure resettlers a sustainable livelihood following resettlement Unfortunately, many benefits the policy promised have not materialized As a result many resettlers have suffered an increase in depressive symptoms associated with unmet expectations Using panel data collected before and after relocation from a sample of Three Gorges resettlers we found that a high proportion of resettlers reported unmet expectations which were significantly associated with an increase in depressive symptoms Our findings indicate that undeliverable promises can backfire and further aggravate the harm inflicted on the displaced caused by the project-induced displacement From the perspective of resettlers, a sound coping strategy to minimize the harm caused by the displacement on their mental wellbeing is to expect for the worst Published by Elsevier Inc
0	There is dissension in the literature on the measurement of attribution of responsibility.  Sociologists, psychologists, and criminologists use attribution of responsibility but its dimensionality has not been established.  The present study was designed to test if attribution of responsibility is a multidimensional or unidimensional concept.  Data were collected from 201 undergraduate students enrolled in Introduction to Sociology courses at a large Midwestern University to examine whether attribution of responsibility is a unidimensional or multidimensional concept.    Results indicate that there are four separate factors associated with attribution of responsibility, causality, knowledge, intentionality, and moral wrongfulness, which supports the contention that attribution of responsibility is a multidimensional concept.  Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.
1	Previous research has identified a positive relationship between prisoner reentry and crime rates. The relationship potentially reflects both the recidivism of reentering offenders and the broader impact of the releases on the social organization of the areas to which they return. This article explores how economic conditions moderate the association between the size of the reentering population and crime rates. Using a state-level panel spanning the years 1978 through 2003, and two alternative measures of economic strength, the results demonstrate that the amount of increase in property and violent crime associated with prisoner societal reentry is substantially lessened by strong economic conditions. The findings suggest that economic conditions and criminal justice policies should not be pitted against each other as simply competing explanations for variation in crime rates. Instead, they should be recognized as irreducibly interdependent. Keywords: mass incarceration, prisoner reentry, crime rate, unemployment, economic conditions.
1	This article draws on the extensive literature on economic and social mobility in America to examine intergenerational contextual mobility, defined as the degree to which inequalities in neighborhood environments persist across generations. PSID data are analyzed to reveal remarkable continuity in neighborhood economic status from one generation to the next. The primary consequence of persistent neighborhood stratification is that the racial inequality in America's neighborhoods that existed a generation ago has been transmitted, for the most part unchanged, to the current generation. More than 70% of black children who grow up in the poorest quarter of American neighborhoods remain in the poorest quarter of neighborhoods as adults, compared to 40% of whites. The results suggest that racial inequality in neighborhood economic status is substantially underestimated with short-term measures of neighborhood income or poverty and, second, that the steps taken to end racial discrimination in the housing and lending markets have not enabled black Americans to advance out of America's poorest neighborhoods.
0	ABSTRACT: Durkheim and others argued that deviance paradoxically promotes group solidarity by uniting individuals in moral outrage and enforcement of shared norms.  Maintenance of social boundaries binds the group together and encourages contribution to collective welfare.  Durkheims reliance on social facts as an explanatory tool, however, left the mechanisms behind this phenomena poorly specified.  In contrast, rational choice models clearly specify mechanisms that induce actors to contribute to collective action, but assume opposition only hinders collective action and thus fail to address the Durkheimian possibility that opposition may help collective action by encouraging enforcement.  Using a model of bounded rationality, I show support for Durkheims primary claim and explore its limitations.
0	Based on 21 months of observations and interviews with 15 male teenagers from Chicago, this paper explores why young men recidivate despite their intentions to stay out of trouble. Developing a concept of “imagined desistance”, it will be argued that the teenagers in this sample construct the event of incarceration as a cathartic moment. This construction is necessary to  rationalize a radical narrative of transformation from “gangbanger” to “docile body”. This imagination of a life without crime is framed within the social reality of the juvenile justice system and is disconnected from the life world of the young men. Their imagination of a life without crime is oriented to toward discipline and self-control rather than  positive re-engagement with the social environment. As a result the teenagers attempt to recreate the sanctioned life they have experienced during incarceration when they return into their communities. Trying to adhere to an almost ascetic concept of self-control prevents a viable role transformation and in this sample leads to a high rate of recidivism.
0	This paper explores the role of employer brand in the retail service labor process. Drawing on participant-observation and interview data, the paper examines the case of a high-line branded retail home furnishings store, asking how management deploys brand meanings to control its front-line retail work process and secure worker consent.  The paper focuses one way the organization uses class-based meanings of its brand to control front-line work, proposing the recasting of retail clerks as brand ambassadors secures worker consent by affording workers an enhanced sense of class identity and symbolic status gains linked to their enactment of their retail labor. The thesis argues that this use of brand meanings in labor process control mobilizes workers class anxieties into a force of retail service production.
1	Because of a lack of data, the locational attainment literature has not incorporated documentation status into models examining group differences in neighborhood quality. I fill this void by using the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, which permits the identification of undocumented respondents, allowing a reexamination of the ethnic structure of locational attainment in this important immigrant-receiving city. Results first suggest that while undocumented Latinos live in the poorest quality communities, blacks live in neighborhoods that are similar to native-born Latinos and better than foreign-born Asians and Latinos. Second, the effects of education are strongest for blacks, allowing the highly educated an opportunity to reside in communities that are of better quality than educated Latinos and Asians. Thus, undocumented Latinos replace blacks at the bottom of the locational attainment hierarchy, allowing educated blacks in Los Angeles to reside in better neighborhoods than blacks in the nation at large. 
1	Literacy is associated with many outcomes of research interest as well as with respondents' ability to even participate in surveys, yet very few surveys attempt to measure it because doing so is often complex, requiring extensive tests. The central goal of this paper is to develop a parsimonious measure of respondents' reading ability that does not require a complex literacy test. We use data from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy to identify correlates of reading ability to form a literacy index. These correlates include self-assessments of one's ability to understand, read and write English, and literacy practices at home. Our literacy index reliably discerns literacy test scores above educational attainment, and the index shows high internal consistency (coefficient alpha = 0.78) and validity. The paper concludes with implications of these findings for survey research practitioners and suggestions for future research.

Exploring fat, fat bodies, and the ensuing sexy politics is one place to start.  It is no surprise that the fat body has been a target of ridicule and oppression – Fat bodies are, after all, a distortion of what “should be.”  The embodiment of control and sacrifice is the fodder of the protestant ethic.  With the obese population, body fat operates as a marker that the person is unable or unwilling to monitor and control personal levels of body fat.  That notion of personal responsibility and control is so simplistic and yet, when one speaks to people who suffer from being over-weight, who are obese, the condition of storing body fat is not something that was consciously planned or desired.  The obese body is embodied within a larger structure of monitoring and control whereby an environment has been constructed where the ability to control one’s level of body fat is an outcome of one’s position within the social and political economy of the social structure.
0	Theory  driven experiments have been critical to the development of cumulative knowledge in network exchange research.  Theory  driven experiment  replicates, then tests, a theoretic model it is imperative that the experiment correspond to the theory.  Yet there has been no systematic analysis of experimental instruments and design across the field.  This chapter examines the instruments and experimental design of four exchange theories; (i) Power Dependence, (ii) Network Exchange; (iii) Expected Value; and (iv) Core.  Central to the discussion is the ability of the experimental instrument to replicate the theoretical model and the internal validity of the experimental design.
0	This study examines the major effects of employment and interacting effects of educational attainment and employment on the physical impairment of the married women of South Korea. Each educational attainment and employment has already received much attention of researchers. In the studies of social determinants of health, however, the relationship between educational attainment and employment has surprisingly few received attentions. This study further examines interaction effect of education and employment on health. Also, in an attempt to grasp the underlying mechanism of this interacting effect, this study investigates the mediating effect of economic status. The major findings are that 1)employment substitutes the benefit of higher educational attainment to physical impairment, 2)that part time employee and temporarily employee report less physical impairment, 3)that benefits from employment are not attributable to economic advantages and 4) that The impact of full-time employment and that of permanent employment are different.
0	Recent years have witnessed an increase in the focus on the health of U.S. minority groups and the foreign-born, in large part due to the changing population composition of the nation. Nearly one-fourth of U.S. residents are members of racial and ethnic minority groups (U.S. Census Bureau) and it is estimated that by the year 2020, about one-third will descend from a minority background. Additionally, the foreign-born population of the U.S. increased by 70 percent- from 1970 to 1990 (Jasso and Rosenzweig 1990; U.S. Census 1993). The 2000 U.S. Census reports that foreign-born currently number over 30 million.  Hispanic populations that grew by almost 58 percent- during the 1990s, comprising 12.5 percent- of the total U.S. population, fundamentally promoted these previously mentioned trends (Guzmán and McConnell 2002).  As in the 1980s, Hispanics were again one of the most rapidly growing racial/ethnic groups in the United States during the 1990s (Guzmán 2001; De Vita 1996; U.S. Bureau of the Census 1992). While substantial literature on mortality differentials across racial/ethnic subpopulations abounds, research on health care access among different segments of the population is not as well developed (see LeClere et al 1994).  This research seeks to fill that gap by examining differences in access to health care of both adults and children among major Hispanic sub-populations of the United States in comparison to whites and blacks, while considering the influence of nativity, citizenship and the length of time lived in the United States.  This research relies on the 1998-2001 National Health Interview Survey.
1	Rising rates of substance use among Hispanic youth, coupled with substantial growth of this minority group, merit grounds for concern. The process of assimilation is frequently examined in studies of Hispanic substance use and has been cited as a reason for higher rates of substance use by U.S.-born Hispanics, compared to their foreign-born peers. However, many previous studies use individual or unidimensional measures of assimilation, when this term is multifaceted. representing different concepts. The current study addresses this gap by testing the longitudinal effect of different assimilation processes (acculturation as well as structural, spatial, and straight-line assimilation), while simultaneously controlling for important familial and social risk and protective factors on the likelihood of alcohol use among U.S.-born Mexican and Mexican immigrant youth. Results indicate that, although alcohol use is higher among immigrant youth, assimilation measures do not predict alcohol use for immigrants or U.S.-born youth. We conclude that the effects of assimilation may vary by person and place. particularly in ethnic enclaves, and suggest the use of measures that incorporate cultural, personal, social, and environmental factors. 
1	Many scientific and nonscientific activities involve practices of counting. Counting is, perhaps, the most elementary of numerical practices: an ability to count is presupposed in arithmetic and other branches of mathematics, and counting also is part of innumerable everyday and specialized activities. Though it is a simple practice when considered abstractly, in specific cases counting can be quite complicated, contentious, and socially consequential. Categorical judgments determine what counts as an eligible case, instance, or datum, and these judgments can be difficult and controversial. By focusing on such difficulties, this article aims to elucidate practices that are crucial for the production and stabilization of natural and social orders. Cases discussed in the article are provisionally divided between counting ( nonhuman) things and counting people. Cases of counting things include scientific practices of counting the number of human chromosomes and forensic procedures for counting matches in DNA profiles. Cases of counting people include estimates of crowd size and counts and recounts of election ballots. Counting people not only is a matter of including an object or person in a class or group, but also involves reciprocal performances in which the counted objects are complicit in, or resistive to, the social production of counts. Variable, and otherwise troubled and contested, instances of counting are used to elucidate the numero-politics of counting: how assigning numbers to things is embedded in disciplined fields, systems of registration and surveillance, technological checks and verifications, and fragile networks of trust. Keywords: counting, numero-politics, science, classification, estimation.
1	The authors describe a common but largely unrecognized mechanism that produces and exacerbates intergroup inequality: the diffusion of valuable practices with positive network externalities through social networks whose members differentially possess characteristics associated with adoption. The authors examine two cases: the first, to explore the mechanism's implications and, the second, to demonstrate its utility in analyzing empirical data. In the first, the diffusion of Internet use, network effects increase adoption's benefits to associates of prior adopters. An agent-based model demonstrates positive, monotonic relationships, given externalities, between homophily bias and intergroup inequality in equilibrium adoption rates. In the second, rural-urban migration in Thailand, network effects reduce risk to persons whose networks include prior migrants. Analysis of longitudinal individual-level migration data indicates that network homophily interacts with network externalities to induce divergence of migration rates among otherwise similar villages.
0	The U.S. seems exceptional as a country because foreign powers have seldom threatened its territory.  Unlike other modern states, the U.S. state was not built in response to invasion and war.  Social scientists who study state growth have focused on the size and funding of federal government bureaucracies--rather than on control over territory--and so they identify the New Deal era as the critical period of growth.  But domestic conflicts over land that dominated courts and legislatures during the nineteenth century were critical in determining the U.S. states relations to citizens and the federal governments relations to state governments.  The federal system and the election of legislators by district and state encouraged advocates of growth to organize by region to compete for favorable federal policies and for federal aid.  The campaign for federal aid to improve flood control is analyzed as one of the land and resource programs that shaped the practice of federalism.  Military bases, highways, and flood control levees have become material expressions of the relationship between the federal government and the states.
0	Sociologists have given substantial attention to shifts toward neoliberal development globally. While a large, cross-national literature on neoliberalism exists, relatively little research explores this topic at the subnational scale in the U.S. Under a neoliberal environment, analysts argue that governments at all spatial scales become more entrepreneurial in economic growth while shedding public provision of services. This paper analyzes subnational space by focusing on counties—little studied governmental units and now the fastest growing subnational governments. The paper addresses two questions: 1) Do counties’ policy responses regarding privatization, economic development, and public service provision follow expectations about the rise of neoliberal governance? 2) To what extent does subnational variation exist due to urban-rural and other locational attributes? To answer these questions, I build from two perspectives, the macro-political economy literature that anticipates a more homogenous spatial spread of neoliberal development and a newer literature on “state-rescaling” that anticipates territorially varied patterns of policy adoption.  Data are from a unique, two-wave study of county governments for 2001 and 2007/2008.  The macro-political economy literature assumes that as neoliberal development proceeds, subnational governments will pursue a trade-off course between redistribution and growth activities: privatizing and cutting back on services while increasing private sector business initiatives.  I found little evidence of a trade-off course: counties are colonizing new arenas of service and economic development activity.  There is no evidence that rural and poorer counties are adopting more of the neoliberal policy package.  The findings correspond more closely to the expectations of the state-rescaling literature.
0	The new South Africa has been deemed the prototype for which other African nations should follow in employing a “successful” post-colonial government. However, if success in a post colonial government is measured by citizen knowledge and participation, then South Africa’s democratic success is in question. As such, this project aims to investigate the factors that lead to political participation in South Africa by using data from the Afrobarometer Study (Round 3) of 2005, a nationwide survey including 2400 participants. My method of analysis is a structural equation model which includes four latent variables: Socioeconomic Status, Political Knowledge, Government Trust and Political Participation. The results were mixed and reveal a uniqueness about the political atmosphere of the new Republic of South Africa.
1	Ecological modernization theory posits that even though economic development harms the environment, the magnitude of the harmful link decreases over the course of development. In contrast, the treadmill of production theory argues that the strong relationship between environmental harms and economic development will remain constant or possibly increase through time. To evaluate these competing propositions, interactions between economic development and time are used in cross-national panel analyses of three measures of carbon dioxide emissions. The results vary across the three outcomes as well as between developed and less developed countries, providingmixed support for both theoretical perspectives. The authors conclude by discussing how both theories could benefit from engaging contemporary research concerning changes within the transnational organization of production and the structure of international trade and how these global shifts influence environment/economic development relationships.
1	Social problems theory has yet to fully address the impact that new communication technologies are having on the claims-making process. This article examines the emergence of the blogosphere as a cultural phenomenon that provides claims-makers with a powerful new public arena to advance social problem claims. Using Stephen Hilgartner and Charles Bosk's (1988) public arenas model of social problem construction, blog-generated problem claims are examined to analyze how Internet driven social problems compete for public attention. Findings suggest that blogs make the claims-making process more efficient, offer expanded carrying capacity compared to traditional arenas, and provide outsider claims-makers with greater opportunity to have a voice in social problems construction. Still, only a small number of blogs have become recognized as claims-making arenas; they still rely on traditional principles of selection; and bloggers face the same competition for mainstream media attention as claims-makers using traditional arenas.
0	Past research showed a century-long decline of extended households and a rise in recent years, attributing the rise to immigration. However, no research studied the effect of immigration generation status. In this paper, we take up this challenge by analyzing March Current Population Surveys 1994 to 2009 (and will extend back to 1970 with the IPUMS data). We conceptualize the research problem as one of social and cultural assimilation. Through descriptive analysis, we establish the trends and patterns of both vertically and horizontal extended households in the US over time and by (first, second, and third+) immigration generation status and by immigrants’ place of origin. We see a clear decline in the prevalence of extended households over the three generations. Through a recently developed hierarchical (mixed) age-period-cohort analyses, we investigate the determinants of household structure, as well as their dynamics across life course patterns, time trends and cohorts. With that we can gain a definitive understanding about the impact of assimilation over immigrant generations on family form.
0	We build on existing studies to develop a model of the pathways that connect social relations and health.  We then argue that these features are conditioned by economic and social relations.  The result is a model suggesting how social relations affect health outcomes.  We argue that several dimensions of social relations constitute key social resources for the individual and examine the possibility that public policy can affect such resources.
0	The decimal metric system of weights measures (a scientific language invented by French mathematicians and astronomers at the end of the eighteenth century) was implemented in Mexico as the exclusive and mandatory system of measurement in 1895. Based on archival research, this paper analyzes how lay people received, learned, and appropriated the metric system for their everyday lives; who accepted the new measures voluntarily and who had to be coerced into it; what forms of opposition appeared. It also describes the strategies of appropriation that people developed to cope with the metric system in their daily activities and how they reacted to the enforcement and policing tactics displayed by the government to secure the actual employment of the metric system.
1	Based on panel data for three age cohorts of children from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we examine how early home environment contributes to black-white achievement gaps at different developmental stages and the extent to which early gaps contribute to later racial achievement gaps. We find large black-white test score differences among children of all ages even before children start formal schooling. Except for the oldest cohort, the gaps for all tests widened when children's cognitive skills were assessed six years later. Racial achievement gaps in applied problem scores by grade three and letter-word scores by grade six, can be accounted for by child's characteristics, family socioeconomic background, and mother's cognitive skills. However, these covariates explain an increasingly smaller proportion of the black-white achievement gap as children advance to higher grades. Gaps in early cognitive skills are highly predictive of gaps at later ages, setting off a trajectory of cumulative disadvantage for black children over time. Our results underscore the key role of early home environment and the intergenerational roots of the persistent black-white achievement gap. 
0	Class conflict within Black America is a controversial and debated topic.  Several scholars claim that a common experience, based on white racism, has led to social and political unity among African-Americans.  However, others predict, with greater economic differentiation, shared feelings of social and political commonality and homogeneity will decrease within this racial group.  Harlem in New York City and Bronzeville in Chicago, arguably the most culturally significant African-American communities in the United States, provides valuable insight on the economic transformation occurring within Black America as a whole.  After decades of economic abandonment, these areas are experiencing a resurgence of residential and commercial investments, triggered, in part, by the return of the black middle-class to these communities.  As the middle-class moves in, the poor are being displaced.  While the displacement is associated with government interventions, the political action of community groups composed of more affluent and middle-class blacks is also contributing.  Based on a four-year, comparative ethnographic investigation, using extensive participant observation, interviews and archival data, this study reveals the internal conflict between lower and upper-income residents.  I argue that intra-racial class antagonism is playing a critical role in the economic development of these communities, and ponder whether or not the redevelopment of Harlem and Bronzeville can be considered racial uplift.  This study supports that notion that class conflict is essential for understanding community change and the black experience in urban America.
0	This paper presents an overview of arguments and evidence from the forthcoming book, Nations of Flesh and Blood: Gender, Race and National Identity. The central contention of the work is that discourses of national identity are routinely gendered and racialized in ways that both reflect and reinforce the marginalization of women and ethnoracial minorities. The empirical evidence examined spans a ten-year period and is drawn from four nations: the US, the UK, Australia and Japan. The paper summarizes conclusions from analyses of television advertisements, Olympic opening ceremonies, news coverage of the Iraq War, post-9-11 letters to the editor, travel brochures, national museums and living history venues in the nations examined, and discusses the broader theoretical and practical implications of these findings.
0	While research demonstrates a relationship between marriage and increased emotional well-being in the general population, we know relatively little about the benefit of marriage for functionally limited adults.  In this paper, we examine whether the emotional benefits of marriage are as great for functionally limited adults compared to their non-limited peers.  Existing research is equivocal and suggests that functionally limited adults derive more, less, and the same benefit from marriage as the non-limited.  However, these studies tend to be based on small, non-representative samples of individuals with specific health problems.  Our paper assesses differences in the association between marriage and emotional well-being for adults with and without functional limitations using the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS).  Multivariate analyses indicate that functionally limited adults derive more benefit from marriage than their non-limited peers with respect to life satisfaction, but there is no difference with respect to other measures of psychological well-being.  For the most part, functionally limited and non-limited adults receive similar emotional benefits from marriage. Our findings suggest the importance of considering functional limitation status when assessing the relationship between marriage and emotional well-being.
1	Focusing on post-Soviet Ukraine, this paper examines how social transformations changed family formation, leading to the world's lowest fertility rate. The findings show that before Ukraine gained independence, highly educated women had higher first birth rates after controlling for school enrollment and marriage. After independence, highly educated women began to delay childbearing. In contrast, second birth and marriage rates declined after independence, but the effect of education on these events did not change. Explanations for the changing affects of education on first births include the restructured educational system, shifting opportunity costs, reduction in childcare benefits, and exposure to new, ideas and values. This study demonstrates how societal-level change not only alters the composition of individual-level characteristics in a population, but also affects the relationship between factors and behavior.
0	This study explores workplace engendering processes that have facilitated a national trend of married womens domestic role orientation amid market transition in post-Mao urban China.  Data come from in-depth interviews of 130 married women from three large cities and one industrialized village.  It is found that while market reform aims at providing individuals with incentives and opportunities to improve their livelihood through decentralization, privatization, and open-door policies, the reform strategies have paradoxically generated doomed incentives, uncertain prosperities, and a stronger attachment to domestic roles among women.  This is found to be mainly caused by emerging antagonistic relations between state and family, between the ruling party and working class women, resulting from the states smashing of socialist welfare functions and egalitarian principles, unbridled development of crony capitalism, and state officials emergence of new bourgeois classes.  Implications for Marxist and feminist grand theories on womens liberation are also discussed in the Chinese context.
0	Quantitative models predicting children's educational attainment typically assume that both the intercepts (means) and slopes (strength of effects) of non-residential parent's education are eqivalent to those of residential parent education.  I use data on non-residential parent educational attainment , coupled with measures of parent involvement, to explain the lower educational outcomes of children raised primarily in single parent families.  I show that the lowered attainment is not an effect of family type per se, but rather due to children's reduced access to non-residential parent educational resources.
0	Much of the literature on religion and secularism involves the idea of a fundamental conflict between (secular) politics and religion. This paper tests the validity of this assumption by applying it to an Islamic case: the separation of the Caliphate from temporal power with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918-1922, which would be the first step towards the demise of the Caliphate itself. I examine, through the Foucaultian discourse analysis, the political and ideological struggle between Islamists and secularists in the process of the Caliphates transformation into a spiritual institution. I demonstrate how both groups employed an intensely Islamic discourse to justify their political claims, which implies a different kind of secularization that was based on the re-definition of religion in the public sphere rather than a direct confrontation with it. I conclude that the boundaries of the sociology of religion could be expanded with an understanding of secularization as accommodation (as well as conflict) between religion and secularism.
1	In this paper, we examine educational differences in married women's labor force attachment in Japan using 10 waves of data from a nationally representative survey. Results of discrete-time multi-state hazard models of labor force exit and entry indicate that university graduates are both more likely to remain in and less likely to reenter the labor force relative to women with a high school education or less. Their relatively low likelihood of labor force exit reflects educational differences in occupational characteristics, especially employment in full-time, standard jobs. However, junior college and university graduates remain substantially less likely to reenter the labor force net of family circumstances, characteristics of previous employment, and efforts to control for unobserved characteristics. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that tension between emerging incentives to remain in the labor force and lingering incentives to remain out of the labor force are both relatively strong among highly educated women. We conclude with speculation about the implications of these educational differences in married women's employment for stratification. 
1	Social psychological research on gendered persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions is dominated by two explanations: women leave because they perceive their family plans to be at odds with demands of STEM careers, and women leave due to low self-assessment of their skills in STEM's intellectual tasks, net of their performance. This study uses original panel data to examine behavioral and intentional persistence among students who enter an engineering major in college. Surprisingly, family plans do not contribute to women's attrition during college but are negatively associated with men's intentions to pursue an engineering career. Additionally, math self-assessment does not predict behavioral or intentional persistence once students enroll in a STEM major. This study introduces professional role confidence-individuals' confidence in their ability to successfully fulfill the roles, competencies, and identity features of a profession-and argues that women's lack of this confidence, compared to men, reduces their likelihood of remaining in engineering majors and careers. We find that professional role confidence predicts behavioral and intentional persistence, and that women's relative lack of this confidence contributes to their attrition.
1	This research investigates the state social control of intergroup conflict by assessing the sociopolitical determinants of hate crime prosecutions. Consistent with insights from the political sociology of punishment, group-threat accounts of intergroup relations and the state, and neoinstitutional theory, the findings suggest that hate crime prosecutions are fewer where political conservatism, Christian fundamentalism, and black population size are higher, although this last effect is nonlinear. Linkages between district attorneys' offices and communities, on the other hand, increase hate crime prosecutions and the likelihood of offices' creating hate crime policies. Yet these policies are sometimes decoupled from actual enforcement, and such decoupling is more likely in politically conservative districts. The results indicate that common correlates of criminal punishment have very different effects on types of state social control that are protective of minority groups, and also suggest conditions under which policy and practice become decoupled in organizational settings.
0	Sociologists assume that interracial marriage demonstrates a blurring of racial boundaries and a lack of social closure between racial groups, particularly in terms of accepting lower stigmatized status groups. However, it is unclear to what extent the individuals in mixed-race unions are able to navigate racial boundaries in terms of black and white contexts and networks.  To what extent do interracial marriages lead to a blurring of boundaries?  In order to answer this question, I use interviewing methods to examine the contemporary experiences of black-white couples in the LA and Rio de Janeiro.  I investigate (1) the social contexts and relations in which the relationships are embedded and (2) the constellations of these meanings around intersections of race, class, and gender.  My research shows that interracial marriage can lead to boundary negotiation whose results vary depending on the race, class, and gender combination of those involved.
1	In this article we take a longitudinal perspective to analyze gender differences in academic career attainment. We improve upon prior research both theoretically and methodologically. Theoretically, we incorporate the extent Of research specialization as a form of professional capital that potentially improves productivity and visibility, especially for men. Methodologically, we introduce a measure of research specialization and examine how men's and women's productivity and visibility unfold over time, rather than examining discrete periods of scholars' careers. We find that specializing is most beneficial with regard to productivity - that is, it helps scholars publish more. Specialization effects on visibility are less general: surprisingly, only women visibility seems to benefit from specialization. We discuss these findings and their implications, and suggest avenues for future research on this important and newly recognized form of capital.
0	We use a political economic analysis to discuss the social and ecological transformations that have occurred in the Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery. The paper offers a critique of the Tragedy of the Commons (ToC) thesis that is frequently applied to explain fisheries decline. Examining the case of Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, we argue that Marx’s explanation of capitalist private property, commodity production, and the general formula for capital provide powerful theoretical guides for clarifying the social relations of production that have driven the over-exploitation of fisheries in the recent past. Relying on historical and qualitative data from 2005-2010, the case study illustrates the ways in which the social imperative of capitalist commodity production toward accumulating surplus-value directs production, reorganizes social relations, and transforms nature into an instrumental input that can more easily serve the needs of capital and results in a tragedy of the commodity.
1	While the idea that contacts matter in finding a job is intuitively appealing, we still do not know-after decades of research-how and why strong ties benefit job seekers. To resolve this confusion, we need to theorize how specific characteristics of ties are related to the mechanisms that make job search through contacts effective. We have reasons to expect that, while a contact's motivation influences the likelihood that a job seeker receives an offer, her homophily with the job seeker on occupation and other job-relevant attributes influences the quality of the offer. The use of strong ties among university students to find jobs in China provides a unique opportunity to empirically isolate the relationship between contact characteristics and the mechanisms through which contacts benefit the job seeker. I tested my hypotheses with data on both the successful and unsuccessful job searches of 478 graduates of China's flagship universities, who, as first-time job seekers, primarily used strong ties. Survey results are consistent with my hypotheses: job seekers who used strong ties to look for jobs had more offers-but not better offers-than those who used only formal methods. 
1	"This article uses the concept of habitus to address the puzzle of past-in-present racial formations. Although formal ideologies of white supremacy may be suddenly overturned, the embodied dispositions of the habitus should prove durable and may even improvise new practices that transpose old racial schemata into new settings. Evidence for these propositions derives from an ethnography of marketing practices inside a leisure firm in post-apartheid South Africa. In the organizational backstage, veteran white managers routinely categorize consumers as desired ""whities"" versus denigrated ""darkies."" But a second discourse of marketing, found in the frontstage, uses survey data to divide the market into ""blue-collar"" and ""jazz"" types. By structuring marketing strategy to attract the former and repel the latter, managers exclude black consumers and euphemize such exclusion vis-a-vis the state and other public audiences. Findings extend not only racial formation theory, but also U.S.-based understandings of discrimination."
1	To test claims that postcolonial civil violence is a common legacy of colonialism, we create a dataset on the colonial heritage of 160 countries and explore whether a history of colonialism is related to indicators of inter-communal conflict, political rebellion and civil war in the years 1960-1999. The analysis provides evidence against sweeping claims that colonialism is a universal cause of civil violence but finds that some forms of colonialism increase the risk of some forms of civil violence. Specifically, the findings support claims that inter-communal violence is a common legacy of colonialism-especially of British colonialism and colonialism by minor colonial powers-but suggest that a history of colonialism has only a limited impact on political rebellion and civil war.
0	The process of family formation dramatically changed in the final third of the 20th century in the U.S.  The literature on differences in timing and sequencing of family formation patterns has largely focused on racial differences, ignoring variation by social class within racial subgroups.  This analysis uses the National Survey of Family Growth to examine and update trends in family formation for women born between 1950 and 1969, taking account both of race and socio-economic status.  We find compelling preliminary evidence of increasing stratification by social class among both blacks and whites in the timing of marriage before the conception of a first birth as well as between conception and first birth, with the most educated women being most likely to marry both before the conception and during pregnancy while the least educated women are less likely to marry in both these periods.  Family formation trends of low SES white women are becoming more similar to those of black women with similar educational attainment.  College graduates of both races are most likely to marry before initiating childbearing though the racial differences remain quite substantial.   These diverging paths in early adulthood may set the scene for increasing inequality in wealth among women and children in the 21st century.
0	This paper addresses some of the more commonly held assumptions about female sexuality and homosexuality among the Latina/o community, specifically the virgin/whore binary expected of women and the intense and volatile reactions to homosexuals. First, the paper will begin by engaging the data available on these social issues (Latina teen age pregnancy and sexual education and the ill-treatment of homosexual Latino/a youth). Second, in response to these cultural norms, this paper will show how popular films from the last ten years are working towards reversing these negative and at times harmful assumptions prevalent among the Latino community. Third, it will also discuss how cultural elements, like the centrality of community and the family or popular religiosity are avenues through which people can change these harmful assumptions and at some point develop a more open way of engaging sexuality among our diverse Latino/a community.  Lastly, the paper will also discuss ways in which non-profit organizations are working towards providing more sexual education to Latinas, giving Latino/a homosexuals the community and support they need as ethnic homosexuals, and taking significant strides in changing these negative attitudes among Latino/as.
1	Much of the research on emotion work in organizations has focused on the ways in which emotional performance reproduces gender inequality. Yet, most of these studies overlook the racial character of professional workplaces and how emotion work is experienced by racial/ethnic minorities. In this article, I examine how the normative feeling rules that guide emotional performance in professional workplaces are racialized rather than neutral or objective criteria. Based on 25 semistructured interviews with black professionals, I contend that feeling rules have different implications for black workers and ultimately reinforce racial difference. This research contributes to the sociological literature on emotion work by further developing the racial components of emotional performance.
1	Using 42 in-depth interviews with rural, Southern whites in Mississippi, I examine the intra-racial boundary work respondents use to construct their regional and racial identities in relation to other whites in their communities, particularly rednecks I find that rednecks are defined and categorized in multiple ways based on the respondents conceptions of Southerners social statuses (i e, age, gender, class and residential history), and intra-racial comparisons around these social characteristics Primarily they draw intra-racial distinctions to separate themselves from negative characterizations and to claim positive associations with being rural, Southern whites Nonetheless the multi-faceted intra-racial boundary work around redneck maintains the general hegemony of whiteness by marginalizing lesser whites' and forms of whiteness and claiming an ideal type of whiteness that is considered untainted, normative and superior
1	Using terms like free spaces and havens, conventional wisdom views social ties by subordinate groups to dominant group members as hindering protest participation. In contrast, we draw on ethnic resiliency and social capital perspectives and argue that there are mobilization benefits to having dominant group members as friends. We offer a unique statistical test by examining the effect of white social ties on Mexican American participation in cultural and political protest. Using survey data, bivariate and multivariate results demonstrate that social connections to whites promote Mexican American activism. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings can be reconciled with previous scholarship.
1	"Despite the increased prevalence of neutral third parties in both formal and informal exchange processes, social exchange theory has yet to consider the effect of nonpartisans on important cognitive and affective outcomes of exchange. This research integrates Simmel's conceptualization of small groups and nonpartisans with contemporary theory and research in social exchange to explore how different levels of neutral third party intervention in an exchange process affect the ""relational outcomes"" of exchange (perceptions of fairness of, general positive regard toward, the exchange partner and optimism about the tone of future interactions). Experimental results indicate that increased third party intervention is positively related to favorable relational outcomes. The increased likelihood of external attributions and decreased salience of conflict associated with high levels of third-party intervention partially explain this result."
1	Class differences in educational decision making are important for inequality. A unique Swedish population-level database of university applications and individuals' ranking of different programs is used to analyze class differences in preferences for different program characteristics. Compared to individuals from service class backgrounds, individuals from manual labor class backgrounds choose programs of shorter duration with lower grade point requirements located closer to their parents' home. Children from the service class instead prefer programs with higher earnings risk and avoid nontraditional institutions. Taken together, the differences in degree choice lead to substantial differences in expected earnings levels and expected unemployment risks.
1	This study combines longitudinal individual-level data with neighborhood-level industrial hazard data to examine the extent and sources of environmental inequality. Results indicate that profound racial and ethnic differences in proximity to industrial pollution persist when differences in individual education, household income, and other microlevel characteristics are controlled. Examination of underlying migration patterns further reveals that black and Latino householders move into neighborhoods with significantly higher hazard levels than do comparable whites and that racial differences in proximity to neighborhood pollution are maintained more by these disparate mobility destinations than by differential effects of pollution on the decision to move.
0	This paper explores the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and urban sprawl in China. This paper argues that in China, the urban area tends to sprawl before real FDI inflow, due to Chinese local states entrepreneurial behavior intended to attract more FDI in local competition. The research is both qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative part involves a case study of Kunshan.Quantitative data include a time series analysis of all 278 prefecture and above cities in China across 7 years (1996-2002). It is found that urban sprawl is a significant positive predictor of next years actual FDI inflow. The result supports the argument of an advanced urban sprawl before FDI inflow. We also found regional effect, that is, urban sprawl can most effectively attract FDI in Coast North and Coastal South rather than Coastal East, the most attractive place for FDI in China; also it attracts FDI for the least favored place, the West.
0	Chinese working-class politics experienced a drastic shift around 1927. Prior to 1927, the warlords' incapacitation in labor policy and indiscriminate and arbitrary suppression brought conflictual state-labor relationss into existence, and working class politics turned out to be radical. After 1927, the new authoritarian regime adopted a dramatically different labor policy in dealing with the labor movements since it had taken control of most of China. Unlike the warlords' regime, the leadership of new regime proclaimed their ideology based on Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, promulgated and amended the Labor Laws, established the local mediating agencies to enforce the laws, and selectively suppressed pro-communist labor unrest. In this way, the new regime gave the rise to consensual state-labor relations, which de-radicalized working class politics, and more specifically, workers obtained a lot of ecnomic benefits from their collective actions.
0	With the introduction of a new technology into a society there is always a differential rate in which individuals and groups within that society begin to fully utilize the technology.  This unequal rate of technological diffusion can occur for numerous social, political, geographic, and economic reasons, which can often occur in combination (DiMaggio, 360; Rogers, 469).  In this paper we use diffusion inequality theories to better understand how weather detection technology is being integrated by Oklahoma emergency managers.  An analysis of 27 in-depth interviews with emergency managers is used to determine the current ability of EMs to access weather detection radar technology as well as the potential impact that future advancements in radar technology may have on these EMs.
0	There is racial-ethnic variation in the prevalence of intergenerational coresidence in the United States. Although the overall trend in which older persons reside with their adult children declined dramatically from almost 70 percent to less than 15 percent during the past century and a half (Ruggles, 2007), a higher rate of stem-family households was found among ethnic minorities versus Euro Americans. Hawaii has the highest percentage of intergenerational households in the nation (He et al., 2007). While the high prevalence of extended family living appears to be a part of the Asian and Pacific Island culture, there is a lack of empirical studies in exploring explanations beyond cultural norms, as well as the variation in coresidence among the various Asian and Pacific Island groups. The analysis is based on the Family Intergenerational Relationship Study in Hawaii, in which data from a statewide representative sample of over 2,600 adults were collected via telephone survey in 2006. Sample was weighted to reflect the state population by age, sex, ethnicity, and county distribution. The analytic sample included 1,204 respondents (weighted sample size=1,492) who had at least one living parent at the time of interview. Analytic method includes descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling. Findings suggest that the prevalence of intergenerational coresidence differ among people of the following ethnic origins: European, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, and Hawaiian. The contributing factors of intergenerational coresidence include ethnicity, and various socioeconomic, demographic, and family relationship characteristics.
1	This paper uses new data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS) to examine how neighborhood norms shape teenagers' substance use. Specifically, it takes advantage of clustered data at the neighborhood level to relate adult neighbors' attitudes and behavior with respect to smoking, drinking, and drugs, which we treat as norms, to teenagers' own smoking, drinking, and drug use. We use hierarchical linear models to account for parents' attitudes and behavior and other characteristics of individuals and families. We also investigate how the association between neighborhood norms and teen behavior depends on: (1) the strength of norms, as measured by consensus in neighbors' attitudes and conformity in their behavior; (2) the willingness and ability of neighbors to enforce norms, for instance, by monitoring teens' activities; and (3) the degree to which teens are exposed to their neighbors. We find little association between neighborhood norms and teen substance use, regardless of how we condition the relationship. We discuss possible theoretical and methodological explanations for this finding. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	Nurses are expected to care as part of their occupation. However, emotion and occupation are often discussed as separate realms of society. What does a partnership of emotion and work mean for those who care as a requirement of their paid labor? To answer this question, the past literature on nurses and grief is reviewed. From the sociology of emotions, Hochschild (1979) argued that feeling rules are social guidelines about how to feel. In this paper, feeling rules are used as the theoretical base to explore the outcomes of care work. Topics in this review include feeling rules for grief in American society, the professional socialization and the work environment of nurses. As outcomes of care work, burnout, depression, and anxiety are reviewed.
0	Patents, this paper argues, are unsatisfactorily understood unless they are regarded as property proper. That is to say, they should be analyzed holistically rather than partially, by either looking at the dimensions of the patent property, or at the functions of it. Consequently, patent systems rather than individual patents will be subject to scrutiny. Also, the focus will then turn from patentee to patent office  a shift it seems that sociologists are yet to take. The final part of the paper will point to a specific area in modern patent law that is in want of sociological attention: Between the United States and Europe there is a discrepancy in the two regions patent regimes originating from slight differences in constitutional articulation, but only recently is it showing importance with the expansion of patentable subject matters  especially in the US. In order to understand and predict future developments of international patent law I think it necessary to engage directly with the differences between the European and the American patent systems through a holistic approach to property. If Sociologists continue to show neglect one of the more dynamic and salient area of modern law and economy is lost from their analyses.
1	This paper studies the influence of state, workplace, and family support on the working hours of employed mothers and how these different support sources interact. Data taken from the European Social Survey 2004/2005 as well as country-specific information were used to estimate several hierarchical models. We find evidence that the availability of supportive workplace arrangements and family support positively impact the working hours of employed mothers and that state policies facilitating the traditional family have a negative effect. There is weak support for a positive relationship between state policies facilitating the dual-earner family and working hours of employed mothers. In addition, most of the sources of support appear to be complementary. Supportive family role models and supportive workplace arrangements have a reinforcing relationship, as do publicly funded child care and supportive workplace arrangements. 
1	Much of what we know about strikes is grounded in the context of postwar Fordism, a unique historical moment of relatively institutionalized labor-management relations. Yet the resurgence of corporate resistance over the past quarter century, coupled with an increasingly hostile political and economic climate, has fundamentally transformed the American industrial landscape. Drawing from this research and insights on social movements and formal organizations, we expect unions will vary considerably in their response to threats. Our analysis, based on a comprehensive data set of U. S. strikes from 1984 to 2002, reveals the importance of such intra-movement cleavages for strike activity and for the prospects of organized labor in the contemporary United States. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for scholarship on threat and social movement challenges more generally.
0	The paper explores Durkheims different notions of rationality, aims to formulate a Durkheimian theory of social integration, which should be both unitary and compatible with a particular version of RCT, and to this end refers to the whole Durkheimian work. To pursue these theoretical goals, it recalls Durkheims fundamental distinction between an individual and social state of consciousness, which may be related to two distinct conceptions of rationality as may be found in RCT. The paper explores, furthermore, the societal preconditions and consequences which characterize, according to Durkheim, the one and the other state of consciousness, especially insofar as solidary rules and norms are concerned. A Durkheimian theory of social integration is then formulated, and its relationship with some unresolved issues in RCT discussed.
1	The prevalence of autism has increased precipitously-roughly 10-fold in the past 40 years-yet no one knows exactly what caused this dramatic rise. Using a large and representative dataset that spans the California birth cohorts from 1992 through 2000, we examine individual and community resources associated with the likelihood of an autism diagnosis over time. This allows us to identify key social factors that have contributed to increased autism prevalence. While individual-level factors, such as birth weight and parental education, have had a fairly constant effect on likelihood of diagnosis over time, we find that community-level resources drive increased prevalence. This study suggests that neighborhoods dynamically interact with the people living in them in different ways at different times to shape health outcomes. By treating neighborhoods as dynamic, we can better understand the changing socioeconomic gradient of autism and the increase in prevalence.
1	We assess the impact of the welfare state on cross-national variation in the gender wage gap. Earnings inequality between men and women is conceptualized as resulting from their different locations in the class hierarchy, combined with the severity of wage differentials between and within classes. This decomposition contributes to identifying the relevant dimensions Of we are states and testing their impact on women's relative earnings. Our empirical analysis is based on income and occupation-based indicators of class and utilizes microdata for 17 post-industrial societies. We find systematic differences between welfare regimes in the components of the gender gap. The evidence supports our claim that the state molds gender inequality in labor market attainments by influencing women class positions and regulating class inequality.
0	Scholars have noted that an elevated level of sports socialization in the family, neighborhood, and media exists within the African-American community creating an overrepresentation of African-American males in certain sports. As a result, African-American males may face consequences that are distinctly different from those who are not socialized as intensively toward athletics, such as lower levels of academic achievement, higher expectations for professional sports careers as a means to upward mobility, and lower levels of career maturity. This study examines the sport socialization of African-American male former collegiate athletes through in-depth ethnographic interviews. This study qualitatively examines the socialization process of African-American male athletes and the intensity of sports socialization that they encountered from socializing agents such as family, role models, neighborhood, media and the African-American community in general. By using in-depth interviews with former Division I athletes the researcher uncovered their perceptions of sports socialization. The athletes were asked whether they believed that sports were overemphasized during their socialization process, and if so how and by whom? They were also asked how they felt this affected their lives and current social location. Although not generalizable to all African-American males, the responses uncovered interesting results supporting the suggestion that sports may be overemphasized among African-American families and other socializing agents.
1	This study examines how dynamics surrounding biographical disruptions compare to more routine fluctuations in personal social networks. Using data from the Indianapolis Network Mental Health Study, the authors track changes in patients' social networks over three years and compare them to a representative sample of persons with no self-reported mental illness. Overall, individuals at the onset of treatment report larger and more broadly functional social networks than individuals in the population at large. However, the number of network ties among the latter increases over time, whereas network size decreases slightly among people using mental health services. As individuals progress through treatment, less broadly supportive ties drop out of extended networks, but a core safety net remains relatively intact. The findings in this case provide evidence that social network dynamics reflect changing needs and resources: persons labeled with psychiatric disorders learn to manage illness, with functionality driving social interaction in times of biographical disruption.
0	Cross-national and temporal variations in mens unpaid work allow observation of mens behavior under varying gender contracts, providing leverage on explanations of mens unpaid work behavior.  I use 37 time use surveys from 20 countries conducted between 1965 and 1998 archived in the Multinational Time Use Survey (MTUS) datasets. I use tobit models predicting mens unpaid time to investigate variation in the effects of individual-level variables across states and to examine the influence of state-level predictors on mens unpaid work. At the individual-level, I include measures of demand and availability, and at the state-level I include measures of womens labor force involvement, policies supporting working women, and policies encouraging mens unpaid work.  I find considerable variation in effects of individual-level variables across countries, suggesting caution in generalizing results from the US to other industrialized countries.  At the macro-level, womens labor force involvement and policies encouraging mens participation in the home increase mens unpaid work time, and policies supporting working women decrease mens unpaid work time. Results help explain the varied impact of womens labor force participation on mens unpaid time, and have potential implications for policies addressing gender equality, fatherhood and child well-being, work/family conflict, and very low fertility.
0	In this paper, I introduce a social psychological dimension to the paradigm of new institutionalism in economic sociology.  In particular, I demonstrate how the source of an actors motivation impacts interpersonal relationships within institutional environments.  The main question I address is why efforts to provide monetary rewards and sanctions to developing countries have been so unsuccessful.  I contend that when motivated to engage in local exchanges solely through external rewards and sanctions (such as those based on aid money), aid recipients tend to engage in interpersonal exchanges with less commitment than they would if they perceived their actions were more self-willed.  As a consequence of this lower commitment, interactions among aid recipients generate low degrees of trust, leading to exchanges that have a low overall level of commitment and are prone to degeneration.  This account highlights the importance of motivational sources in institutional contexts.  New institutionalism in economic sociology focuses on the importance of incentives, but it does not address the psychological impact of incentives that are extrinsic versus intrinsic.  By elaborating on this distinction, this paper seeks to add an important dimension missing from the current literature in new institutionalism.

1	Research on social movements and public policy has expanded tremendously in recent years, yet little of this work considers the role of movement opponents in the political process or how the movement-countermovement dynamic is influential in contests over policy. This historical study begins to fill this void by analyzing the contestation between employers and labor movement actors in relation to two critical right-to-work campaigns in the industrial Midwest in the 1950s. I find that actors who balance formal, professionalized organization with a more localized presence on the ground are in a better position to pursue multiple mechanisms of influence and to shape policy, while internal divisions severely limit their prospects. Event structure analyses of right-to-work campaigns advance this discussion, revealing how social movement organizational characteristics matter to the extent that they enable opposing movements to counter each others actions in unfolding political processes. I conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for perspectives on social movements and politics, and for research dealing specifically with the US. labor movement.
1	"In October 1962, the fate of the world hung on the U. S. response to the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. President Kennedy's decision to impose a blockade was based on hours of discussions with top advisers (the so-called ExComm), yet decades of scholarship on the crisis have missed the central puzzle: How did the group select one response, the blockade, when all options seemed bad? Recently released audio recordings are used to argue that the key conversational activity was storytelling about an uncertain future. Kennedy's choice of a blockade hinged on the narrative ""suppression"" of its most dangerous possible consequence, namely the perils of a later attack against operational missiles, something accomplished through omission, self-censorship, ambiguation, uptake failure, and narrative interdiction. The article makes the very first connection between the localized dynamics of conversation and decision making in times of crisis, and offers a novel processual account of one of the most fateful decisions in human history."
1	Arguments about the spread of gender egalitarian values through the population highlight several sources of change. First, structural arguments point to increases in the proportion of women with high education, jobs with good pay, commitment to careers outside the family, and direct interests in gender equality. Second, value shift arguments contend that gender norms change with social and economic development among women and men in diverse positions-traditional and non-traditional alike. Third, diffusion arguments suggest that structural change leads to adoption of new ideas and values supportive of gender equality by non-traditional and innovative groups in society, but that the new ideas later diffuse to other groups through cultural processes. Using the General Social Survey from 1977 to 2006 and comparing the determinants of gender egalitarianism across 86 cohorts born from roughly 1900 through 1985, multilevel models support the diffusion arguments.

DuBois (1903), Manning Marabel (1983) and Walter Rodney (1974) explicitly include the importance of land as a source of wealth (and its absence as a source of poverty). Yet while a “materialist” basis for identity, culture and wealth in the natural world is acknowledged by Native scholars, contemporary sociological scholarship has generally failed to incorporate the environment in racial analyses. Instead, the role of the environment has remained outside sociological conceptions of institutionalized racism or racial formation. Here we aim to situate the production of Karuk poverty and hunger within a more integrated theory of racial formation. We use the ongoing struggle of the Karuk Tribe of California to maintain access to their traditional foods to illustrate how the production of hunger has been the result of a series of a “racial projects” through which traditional Karuk management practices have been damaged, wealth has been transferred to non-Indian hands and the environment has been degraded. We describe three racial projects significant for the production of hunger in today’s Karuk community. We argue that theory on racial formation and the environmental must be integrated.
1	"During the 1960s and 70s the United States environmental movement experienced dramatic growth in both absolute size and in the diversity of organizational structures and issues represented within the movement. We assess the importance Of change in movement size and compositional diversity on two important stages within the legislative process. Findings indicate that U.S. environmental movement size is positively associated with the incidence of Congressional environmental agenda-setting activities, but not the passage of environmental laws. An increased diversity of issue representation within the movement is consistently and positively associated with the incidence of agenda setting and law-passage activity. The growth of EMOs attending simultaneously to both traditional conservation and ""new"" quality of life issues, in particular, is associated with elevated rates of policy activity."
1	Ideas about community are especially prominent in late-twentieth-century U.S. society. The term community resonates throughout social policy, scholarship, popular culture, and everyday social interactions. It holds significance for different populations with competing political agendas (e. g., political groups of the right and the left invoke ideas of community yet have very different ideas in mind). No longer seen as naturally occurring, apolitical spaces to which one retreats to escape the pressures of modern life, communities of all sorts now constitute sites of political engagement and contestation. The new politics of community reveals how the idea of community constitutes an elastic political construct that holds a variety of contradictory meanings and around which diverse social practices occur. In this address, I analyze how reframing the idea of community as a political construct might provide new avenues for investigating social inequalities. I first explore the utility of community as a political construct for rethinking both intersecting systems of power and activities that are routinely characterized as 'political.'' Next, by examining five contemporary sites where community is either visibly named as a political construct or implicated in significant political phenomena, I investigate how the construct of community operates within contemporary power relations of class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, ability, nation, and race. Finally, I explore the potential intellectual and political significance of these developments.
0	Family size is an important determinant of family wellbeing, and it is also a good predictor of poverty. This study examines effects of waiving the 100-hour rule, by family size, and distinguishes between the work incentive effects and the eligibility effects of the waiver.  The 100-hour rule limits eligibility to aid to two-parent families where the principal earner is unemployed or underemployed (works fewer than 100-hours a month). The study uses data from the Link-Up randomized experiment, conducted in Californias Central Valley, 1992  1994.  The findings show that the eligibility effect of the waiver does not differ by family size, but the work-incentive effect does.
1	"Although recent increases in imprisonment are concentrated in poor Black communities, we know little about how daily life within these neighborhoods is affected. Almost all ethnographic work in poor minority neighborhoods was written before the expansion of the criminal justice system, and the bulk of research on ""mass imprisonment"" relies on survey data, field experiments, or interviews, conceptualizing its impact in terms of current or former felons and their families. Drawing on six years of fieldwork in Philadelphia, this article shifts the focus from imprisonment and criminal records to the increase in policing and supervision in poor Black neighborhoods, and what this has meant for a growing status group of wanted people. For many young men, avoiding jail has become a daily preoccupation: they have warrants out for minor infractions, like failing to pay court fees or braking curfew, and will be detained if they are identified. Such threat of imprisonment transforms social relations by undermining already tenuous attachments to family, work, and community. But young men also rely on their precarious legal standing to explain failures that would have occurred anyway, while girlfriends and neighbors exploit their wanted status as an instrument of social control. I discuss the implications of my ethnographic observations relative to prior treatments of the poor and policing, and with regard to broader sociological questions about punishment and surveillance in the modern era."
1	Prior to 2002, little was known about sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. After the Boston Globe broke the story about John Geoghan - a priest in the Boston Archdiocese who was accused of abusing numerous children, convicted of one count of indecent assault, and eventually murdered in prison - the Church had many questions to answer. To this end, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) commissioned John Jay College of Criminal Justice to research the nature and scope, as well as the causes and context of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.
0	The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status and psychological distress across Latino ethnic groups.  The 2004 American Community Survey estimated that the number of Hispanics would be 40.5 million and 14.2% of the total population in the US by the year 2010.  The fast growing Latino population calls for a need to examine their health in a society where race and ethnicity shape the population pattern of socioeconomic achievement and health status.  This study is driven by social variation within Latinos.  Using data from the National Latino and Asian American Study, I examine the impact of education, income, and wealth upon psychological distress among Cubans, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.  Findings indicate that the three groups differ in their level of education, income, and wealth.  Socioeconomic resources also impose different effect on psychological distress across the groups.  The Hispanic paradox is observed only for Mexican Americans.  Despite their low SES, they have a lower level of psychological distress than Cubans and Puerto Ricans.  Income and education predict psychological distress for Cubans and Puerto Ricans.  Wealth is negatively associated with psychological distress only among Puerto Ricans.  In contrast, none of the SES indicators pose as a risk factor for Mexicans.  Non-linear relationships exist between income and education and psychological distress among Cubans and Puerto Ricans.  Results reinforce a need to probe into which aspect of Latino ethnicity impacts their mental health status.
0	Korean Americans are one of the poorest ethnic groups in the United States. In Los Angeles County, 15.81% of Koreans fall below the federal poverty line, compared with 14.82% in California, and 6.44% are unemployed, compared to 5.78% statewide.  Korean Americans have the highest rate of self-employment amongst all ethnic groups,  which translates into couples working long hours together, creating strain and the neglect of children. Approximately 75% of Koreans arrived in the U.S. after the 1970s, and both these first-generation adults and their children face significant language and cultural barriers. The number of divorced Asian Pacific Americans more than doubled between 1996 and 2002,  and Koreans have the highest rates of domestic violence among Asian Americans.  Despite this reality, the needs of Korean American families have been lost in easy categorizations of them as the model minority. Consequently, various healthy marriage initiatives and family building programs exist for other ethnic minority groups, but no such programs exist for the Korean American and greater Asian American community. In response, this research examines the various hidden problems and sources of tensions within Korean American marriages and identifies marriage/family support needs and strategies for the community.
0	Attendance at a quality high school is thought to provide a necessary basis for success in the workplace and in postsecondary education.  This study explores the effects of high school quality indicators on postsecondary educational (PSE) attainment while controlling for student demographics and parent resources.  The findings show that, although the indicators of high school quality are less influential than parent resources, they make an important contribution to PSE outcomes nevertheless.  Furthermore, we find that students from disadvantaged families are less likely to benefit from quality high schools.  The study, which uses hierarchical generalized linear modeling to analyze the PSE outcomes of the NELS 1992 cohort of high school seniors, also finds that high school quality has two important dimensions with nearly equivalent effects on PSE outcome.  High school quality involves, on the one hand, strong academics and an orientation toward postsecondary education and, on the other hand, the organizational integration of the school.  The latter dimension embraces what is often termed school climate along with student participation in extracurricular activities.  Implications of the findings for educational policy will be discussed.
0	In many high-fertility countries, and especially in sub-Saharan Africa, substantial proportions of women give non-numeric responses when asked about desired family size.  Classical demographic theory interprets responses of dont know or up to God as evidence of fatalistic attitudes toward childbearing.  Alternatively, these responses can be understood as meaningful reactions to uncertainty about the future.  Following this latter approach, we use data from rural Mozambique to test the hypothesis that non-numeric responses are more common when uncertainty about the future is greater.  We expand on previous research linking child mortality and non-numeric fertility preferences by testing the predictive power of economic conditions, marital instability, and adult mortality.  Results show that uncertainty related to adult and child mortality and to economic conditions predicts non-numeric responses, while marital stability is less strongly related.
0	I draw from in-depth interviews with 22 husbands and wives who care for their cognitively impaired spouses and support group data to explore a number of issues related to gender and carework.  Rather than posit more or less stress, I focus on ways that gender may shape sources of stress among spouses who essentially perform similar types and amounts of carework.  I find that, first, women face higher expectations for caregiving than they confronted as mothers, and than their male counterparts face.  As a result, they are more vulnerable to stress and guilt than are men.  Understanding age relations also allows us to see that, by caring for a marginalized other (an old, demented person), wives also risk greater isolation.   By contrast, men who care for their spouses are more likely to receive kudos for their work and may thus be shielded from some of these repercussions.  Second, I find that, despite their previous carework experience, wives find some aspects of carework more daunting than do husbands, particularly, aspects of what Twigg (2004) refers to as bodywork. Important differences accrue to caring for a child versus caring for one with whom one has had an intimate relationship, and I argue that gender further shapes this context.  Finally, I find that husbands express very little discomfort in dealing with bodywork and further, that they are more likely to experience violent behavior from their spouses than are women.
1	This article examines spatial relationships between environmental hazards (i e., pork feed lots, brick kilns, final assembly plants and a rail line) and markers of social marginality in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Juarez represents an opportunity lot researchers to test for patterns of injustice in a recently urbanizing metropolis of the Global South. We use spatial-econometric modeling to predict the four unique hazard variables and a composite hazard variable using socio-demographic variables at the neighborhood level Lower class and higher percentages of children and migrants were statistically significant predictors of composite hazard density These results align with previous studies in the North. However, disaggregating these results by hazard type reveals important and counterintuitive differences in groups at risk based on the market-orientation of the hazard (i.e., domestic vs transnational) and its location within the urban structure.
1	Adolescent employment is typically framed as having either positive or negative effects. Yet cutting edge research yields apparently contradictory results; work lowers delinquency but also increases school dropout. Both opportunity cost and life course development theories could explain these results. This study investigates effects of employment on fertility among adolescent women, which pits life course development against opportunity cost theory. Using 2006 and 2007 American Community Surveys, individual instrumental variable and state-level difference-in-difference models (following the same cohort over time) control for self-selection and find a positive effect of employment on adolescent fertility. National Vital Statistics birth data confirm state-level results. Results for fertility (and some evidence for other early transitions) indicate that youth employment speeds the transition to adulthood, supporting life course theory. Findings suggest adolescent employment should be reconceived as promoting adult rather than positive or negative behavior. 
1	Besides reducing overall smoking prevalence, do anti-tobacco policies to raise prices and restrict locations for smoking also reduce educational disparities? Theories emphasizing proximate disincentives answers yes, suggesting that the policy changes create stronger disincentives for smoking among low education groups. A social resource or fundamental cause theory suggests in contrast that flexible and broad resource advantages of high education groups maintain inequalities in health behavior despite policy changes. Using 24 National Health Interview Surveys, this study tests these claims by describing smoking prevalence by education level from 1976 to 2006 in the United States and giving special attention to the last ten years when tax and clean-air policies have expanded. Logistic regression models that allow trends in smoking to vary by education, race, ethnicity, and nativity find a small decline in educational disparities in smoking. However, this decline stemmed from trends among Hispanic and foreign-born respondents; in contrast, smoking disparities among white, African American, and native-born respondents show no evidence of narrowing. Likely due to the greater resources of high education groups for health behavior, changes in prices and restrictions thus far have done little to reduce educational disparities.
0	This study asks how U.S. newspapers reported on weapons inspections in Iraq before and after the 2003 invasion by an informal U.S.-led coalition.  It illustrates that the framing of weapons inspections in Iraq between 2002 and 2004 can be understood through a multidimensional approach to news incorporating macroinstitutional, microinstitutional, and cultural approaches to news production and content.  Both papers framed weapons inspections as a way to legitimate or delegitimate U.S. policy according to the logic of U.S. strategic interest.  This framing of Iraqi inspections can be explained through several interlocking factors: the influence of elite political rhetoric on the views of inspections offered by journalists, the practices of a media establishment highly dependent on official sources, and continuity with a cultural narrative dominated by the September 11th attacks.
1	This article explores the national factors that predict bishops' votes on two of the most contentious issues at the Second Vatican Council. Using data obtained from the Vatican Secret Archive, analyses demonstrate that rational choice oriented theory in the sociology of religion that focuses on competition is limited. While competition is important to religious leaders' actions, its effects can be understood only in relation to other crucial characteristics of the social environment within which leaders operate. These characteristics, which we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders' interests and often lead them to prioritize concerns about their institutions' legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growth rational choice theorists assume are predominant. Most NIT studies examine the population of firms within one organizational field. Because we hold firm constant and examine how variation in the type of organizational field (supplied by the more than 100 countries in our analyses) predicts firm leaders' actions, this study represents a unique test of NIT.
1	Despite an ongoing debate over the validity of vignettes, little research has explored either why, or in what research areas, the vignette method may be particularly problematic. In this paper, we draw on Affect Control Theory (ACT) to directly investigate the difference between vignettes and a more experiential method in research on social exchange and alternative dispute resolution. Using ACT's affective dimensions of evaluation, potency, and activity, as well as its concept of deflection, we compare the affective responses of participants in two types of experimental simulations - vignettes and a laboratory experiment. Results suggest that a more tangible experience, like that present in our laboratory experiment, leads to greater deflection, therefore increasing the intensity of emotion and altering affective meanings. We argue that these findings could have important implications for research, particularly in areas exploring affective and cognitive outcomes of interaction. 
0	Using time-series cross-section data, this study examined how the impact of education varies across different social context in the transition from school to work by comparing young Koreans before and after the 1997 economic crisis. The findings indicate that the effect of education is contingent upon labor market transition timing. Specifically, the impact of education is stronger since the 1997 economic crisis, indicating that education became a more important factor determining successful transitions to the labor market under the economic crisis, compared with previous economically expanding periods. However, this study does not show whether this reflects productivity or screening. Findings also indicate that the post-crisis cohort is significantly associated with lower occupational prestige regardless of level of education. Therefore, it seems that young Koreans since the 1997 economic crisis mainly focused on job attainment. Given that there is strong stigma for prolonged non-employment period, this labor market strategy seems to be reasonable in Korea.
1	"During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Pentagon introduced a program ""embedding"" journalists in military units. Embedded reporters have been widely criticized for allegedly failing to adequately cover effects of the war on Iraqi civilians, while over-emphasizing the personal lives of troops. Proponents of the embedding program argue that the program provides journalists with a detailed understanding of military culture and life on the frontline. In addition to the embedded reporters, some journalists were stationed in Baghdad and others were independent and free to roam. I argue that these three journalistic vantage points channeled reporters toward particular news content, while limiting their access to others. I hypothesize that while embedded reporters effectively presented the military experience of the war and the Baghdad-stationed reporters successfully covered the Iraqi experience of the war, the independent reporters were able to provide the most balanced coverage of the war. I demonstrate that despite the largely one-sided story presented, articles by embedded journalists were both more prominent and more widely available than coverage from other vantage points. Due to the dominance of embedded reporting, I conclude by noting that the majority of war coverage in print media heavily emphasized the soldier's experience of the war, while downplaying the effects of the invasion on the Iraqi people. By conducting a content analysis of 742 print news articles by 156 journalists from the major combat period of the war, this study offers one of the first systematic documentations of the substantive content of Iraq war coverage."
0	This project investigates dynamic interactions among the media, the market and the state in China.  As opposed to conventional liberal and critical theories, I take organizations as units of analysis and propose an organizational capacity theory to explore this issue. I argue that media behavior is the result of a learning dynamic over time, which depends on the organizational capacities of both the state and the media during commercialization. Organizational capacity is in turn shaped by ideological capacity; formal structure and informal norms; resource dependence; and mobility channels of human capital. Focusing on Newspapers in China, I employ a series of methods to test the proposed hypotheses, including participation-observation in the Oriental Morning Post in Shanghai, the Southern Metropolitan Daily in Guangzhou; as well as in-depth interviews and a semi-structured survey of journalists in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing and Chengdu.
0	This paper details the parameters of queer femme identity.  The author utilizes 31 interviews with queer femme-identified people involved in femme organizations and/or femme burlesque performances.  Femme identity is unique in that it involves external markers of femininity and a concious and deliberate identification with femininity. As such, interviewees explained that although they are feminine women, they view their gender identity as a challenge to patriarchy's demand that women must be feminine -- because they choose femininity.  This look at the subcultural phenomenon of feminine identification provides a small scale example of the broader cultural mandates of gender.
0	Adolescence, in the life course, is a transitional stage in which individuals begin to assume adult roles and form identities based in the context of their unique social environments.  Drawing upon theoretical perspectives pertaining to social capital, differential association, and networks of group affiliations, the internalization of normative behavior and self-definition among youth is explored.  Specifically, this paper seeks to examine the pressures, both positive and negative, of varying network affiliations on an adolescents decision to engage in marijuana abuse.  While every adolescent displays a multitude of attributes, hopefully, careful examination of common network structures can elucidate how and when marijuana is introduced and alters adolescent friendship networks.  Simmelian concepts concerning concentric and cross-cutting circles should be utilized to assess the construction and dissolution of network ties over time where marijuana use pervades.
1	Panel surveys are widely used in sociology to examine life-course trajectories and to assess causal effects. However, when using panel data researchers usually assume that the act of measuring respondents' attitudes and behaviors has no effect on the attributes being measured or on the accuracy of reports about those attributes. Evidence from cognitive psychology, marketing research, political science and other fields suggests that this assumption may not be warranted. Using a rigorous experimental design, we examine the magnitude of panel conditioning bias - the bias emerging from having answered questions in prior waves of a survey - in a panel study of substance use among adolescents in Chile. We find that adolescents who answered survey questions about alcohol, cigarette, marijuana and cocaine use were considerably less likely than members of a control group to report substance use when re-interviewed one year later. This finding has important implications, and also points to the need for sociologists to be concerned about panel conditioning as an important methodological issue.
0	Existing literature on the effects of school mobility does not currently provide a clear consensus as to whether changing schools during the school year has a significant impact on students’ performance.  Some studies have found significant negative effects, while others have not.  Much of this confusion is a result of the fact many methodologies do not include adequate controls for prior achievement and learning growth rates.  Using multilevel analysis, I estimate achievement differences between mobile and stable students during a year in which some students changed schools and during a previous year in which all students were stable.  The analysis estimates disparities between the initial status of math and reading scores at the end of third grade, the linear growth rate students achieved during the next two years, and the change in this growth rate that occurred during the second year.  The results indicate that significant achievement gaps exist between mobile and stable students in the years before students moved, but that mobile students did not experience different changes in their growth rates in the year in which they moved.  The modified interrupted time series analyses employed holds promise for reconciling inconsistencies in the findings of the prior literature.
1	"After the burst of its ""bubble"" economy in 1989, Japan experienced an astonishingly long economic recession whose gravity surpassed any seen in the industrialized world since the 1930s. While this recession is likely to have important consequences on the well-known workplace arrangements and career mobility patterns in that country, systematic analyses of such consequences are nearly absent. This study examines changes in the rates and directions of job mobility in Japan using work history data collected in 2005 from a nationally representative sample of men and women. I find evidence that Japanese firms have largely retained the core elements of the permanent employment system. The norm that stresses men's loyalty to their employers, however, appears to have weakened, resulting in higher voluntary job turnover among male workers. In addition, the gender gap in lifetime mobility processes has narrowed, but not because Japanese women have gained opportunities in the workplace. Rather, economic stagnation has led to greater fluctuations in employment and wages over men's life course, thereby closing the gender gap. Beyond illustrating the changing stratification process in Japan, the findings have general implications for understanding how economic crises impact employment relations, institutional transformations, and social change in advanced industrialized countries.

0	Actor, Situation and Normative Patterns: An Essay in the Theory of Social Action is a manuscript, that Talcott Parsons wrote in 1939.  Although the reasons are not clear, the manuscript was never published in his lifetime.  The manuscript represents an important phase in Parsons intellectual development.  It presents, with some variation in terminology, the first version of the distinctions among cognitive, affective, and moral dimensions of action systems.  Moreover, the terminology gives clear indication that Kants writings were a principal source of the distinctions, a source not directly acknowledged in the 1951 publications.  The manuscript also presents Parsons first formulations in functional theory and thus documents the start of a chain of reflections that resulted only in the 1960s and 1970s in the mature formulations of his famous four function paradigm.  In these two fundamental respects, the manuscript provides important historical detail on the path of theoretical development that Parsons followed when he departed from the early, elementary formulations of The Structure of Social Action toward his mature thought.  However, the manuscript is of more than historical importance.  It was perhaps the last of his works on basic social theory to show in the exposition of its argument the meticulously careful development and justification of ideas that characterized The Structure of Social Action.
0	Using a sample of 6444 decedents aged 80 from the first three waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, the present study examine how individuals characteristics, availability and accessibility of formal and informal care sources, and community development affect the place of death. Our results show that these factors are highly correlated with place of death which is line with prior studies. However, the pattern of place of death is entirely different between China, a developing country, and developed nations. Nearly 90% of decedents in our sample die at home, whereas hospital death is high in western societies although there is increased trend in home death due to development in hospice care and home health care. We, therefore, propose a three-stage evolution hypothesis of place of death trying to explain the difference in place of death in different stage and different effect of individual characteristics on place of death across studies.
1	This article explores the conditions under which political modernization leads to nation building, to the politicization of ethnic cleavages, or to populism by modeling these three outcomes as more or less encompassing exchange relationships between state elites, counterelites, and the population. Actors seek coalitions that grant them the most advantageous exchange of taxation against public goods and of military support against political participation. Modeling historical data on the distribution of these resources in France and the Ottoman Empire from 1500 to 1900 shows that nation building results from strong state centralization and well-established civil societies; ethnic closure, from weak state capacity and civil societies; and populism, from medium centralization and weak civil societies. The results are consistent with French and Ottoman political histories of the 18th and 19th centuries.
0	This paper examines a shift in technological discourse in America through a historical comparison of two groups of popular technological utopias (1880-1920, 1969-2008). Employing concepts from the sociology of literature and existing theory of technological discourse, it employs content analysis to point out that the two groups differ on the important themes of risk and progress. This shift is then situated in the historical context of each sample to conclude that the American cultural repertoire for understanding technology has successfully incorporated formerly radical critical perspectives. This paper further asserts that technological utopias provide a unique opportunity to examine the construction of cultural repertoires of technology.
0	The issue of risk in post-industrial American society remains complex.  Risk pervades the lives of individuals at all stages of the lifecourse.  Club drugs emerged during the final decade of the 20th century to newly complicate the issue of risk among youth.  Though often portrayed otherwise, many youth are far from unaware about the risks associated with club drugs.  Though they conceive of drug use and its risks in ways that are logical to them, these rationalizations do not stem simply from a philosophical logic of an internally consistent mind.  Rather, these conceptions are grounded in the political-economy of post-industrial America.  Aside from the worldviews fashioned from the lived experiences of suburban middle-classness, a series of structures and historical particulars shape the manner in which they interpret and deal with risk.  The durable dispositions that emerge from the experience of a specific social context set the parameters for how youth contend with risk in their lives and contribute to their practice of educated consumerism.  Neo-liberalism, the self-help movement, and shifts in consumption patterns intersect with the collective biographies of this generation and influence both how they understand risk and their practice of drug taking.  This paper describes the intersection of neo-liberalism and its associated forms with the lives of youth reared in late-twentieth century suburbs and how they have influenced the manner in which these youth think about risk and engage in the practice of an educated consumerism of club drugs.
1	"A notable feature of U. S. social networks is their high degree of racial homogeneity, which is often attributed to racial homophily-the preference for associating with individuals of the same racial background. The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e. g., students from ""elite"" backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily."
1	I use panel data to empirically assess the effects of a variety of theoretically important structural factors on national level CO(2) emissions in the former Soviet republics, a context of de-modernization and peripheralization. Several theories address the effects of modernization on the environment, but they neglect to consider the environmental consequences of de-modernization. Unlike the trends in most other nations over the twentieth century, former Soviet republics in the 1990s saw their collective population size, economy, level of urbanization, level of industrialization, and international trade decline, and, thus, they provide an ideal context in which to assess the effects of de-modernization on the environment. In addition to the dramatic changes in economic and demographic factors, the size of the militaries of the former Soviet republics changed substantially during the 1990s, with some republics expanding their militaries while other were scaling theirs back. I take advantage of the substantial variation within the former Soviet republics, and assess the effects of militarization, in addition to economic and demographic factors, on CO(2) emissions. I find that de-modernization, as indicated by declines in GDP per capita and urbanization, led to declines in CO(2) emissions, countering claims that further modernization is necessary to resolve the environmental crisis. I also find that militarization has an effect on CO(2) emissions above and beyond that of economic development.
0	Educational achievement has been studied as a function of family SES, school and/or neighborhood, ethnicity, gender, age, sibship size and composition, as well as more individual-specific environmental factors such as parental aspiration for this particular child, cultural and social capital, and experiences with problem behaviors. This paper examines the effects of these individual-specific environmental factors after adjusting for the other environmental factors and more importantly after adjusting for genetic factors. These adjustments are obtained utilizing the identical adolescent twins in secondary school from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).  Educational achievement has three indicators: ability score, college plans, and GPA. Ability score does not seem to be related to any of the individual specific environmental factors. In contrast, many of the individual-specific factors have a statistically significant influence on college plans and GPA on top of all the environmental and genetic factors shared by the MZ twin pairs suggesting that an individual's experiences and ambition do have an influence on his or her educational outcomes.
0	ABSTRACT:           This paper will analyze the methods that the Government of Sudan (GOS) and its accomplices, the Janjaweed, are using to commit genocide in the Western Region of Sudan, Darfur. The Government of Sudan is a repeat offender in its brutal methods of holding on to power by targeting segments of civilian populations to terrorize and kill. The directives and methods used by  the GOS, its military and their proxies, the Janjaweed militias, meet several of the criteria in the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. The paper will focus on the societal impact of the genocide in Darfur and examine how the destruction of both civilian lives and of survivors livelihoods and ways of life have resulted in millions of internally displaced people (IDP) living in insecure and desperate circumstances in IDP gatherings. In less than two years, millions of  civilians now called IDPs are trapped in gatherings within Sudan, dependent on humanitarian agencies for temporary aid and continue to be targeted by the GOS and Janjaweed attacks as well as dying by attrition namely disease and malnutrition. Furthermore, the long term impact of this forced displacement is to sever traditional bonds and ways of life and to effectively carry out genocidal policies deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. (UN Genocide Convention)
0	Interviews with 53 women experiencing their first journeys into motherhood reveal that the journey is discursively constructed and mediated, often with other mothers. One type of discourse into which new mothers are invited is the sharing of rounds of birth stories. These birth stories create and reflect cultural narratives of motherhood and are used by both the tellers and the listeners to construct, affirm and repudiate cultural constructions of good mothers and appropriate births. The fact that new mothers, for a period of time, tell and retell their birth stories, sometimes with the same people, indicates the importance of the birth story in the construction and communication of the new sense of maternal identity. I examine the informal rules, expectations and experiences around the sharing of birth stories.
1	This study takes a life-course approach to examine whether family, and religious characteristics influence individual-level delinquency, trajectories from early adolescence through young adulthood. Based oil data from the NLSY79, results suggest that residing with two parents deters youths from becoming delinquent and that supportive parenting practices reduce their likelihood of becoming involved in delinquent behavior early in adolescence. There is also evidence that family, and religion interact to predict delinquency trajectories. Religion enhances the effect of parental affection in deterring delinquent behavior and mitigates the increased risk of high levels of delinquent behavior among youths in single-parent families. Moreover the findings indicate that delinquency trajectories are not immutable; family transitions are associated with increases in delinquency, bill religious participation throughout adolescence and marriage are associated with declines in delinquent behavior Overall, results suggest that family and religious characteristics continually influence the event to which youths commit delinquent acts.
0	This paper is a first draft based on recently collected data on women working in the indoor sex trade in New York City. Using ethnographic and social science survey methods, the ability of indoor sex workers to create stability in their lives through their social networks and their relationships to money, work, and community institutions was examined. Our findings suggest that while sex workers who work indoors and on the street are subject to similar social and economic vulnerabilities, three particular characteristics of this trade  the development of an addiction to the profession, the ability to create in sex work qualities of work not available in the formal economy, and the unique, solitary nature of this isolated type of underground economy  serves to entrap women who work indoors in a cycle of sex work. We argue that as these women continue to engage in the trade, it is these characteristics of the work that make indoor sex workers depend on sex work as a source of income generation for longer periods of time than women working outdoors. This, combined with the invisibility of women who work indoors, makes exit from the trade more difficult for indoor workers than it does for those on the street. We conclude by arguing that as policies that serve to push sex work indoors are continually supported, it becomes increasingly important to understand the detrimental effects of this shift to indoor work on the lives of women in the trade.
1	Global climate change is one of the most severe problems facing societies around the world. Very few assessments of the social forces that influence greenhouse gas emissions have examined gender inequality. Empirical research suggests that women are more likely than men to support environmental protection. Various strands of feminist theory suggest that this is due to women's traditional roles as caregivers, subsistence food producers, water and fuelwood collectors, and reproducers of human life. Other theorists argue that women's status and environmental protection are linked because the exploitation of women and the exploitation of nature are interconnected processes. For these theoretical and empirical reasons, we hypothesize that in societies with greater gender equality there will be relatively lower impacts on the environment, controlling for other factors. We test this hypothesis using quantitative analysis of cross-national data, focusing on the connection between women's political status and CO2 emissions per capita. We find that CO2 emissions per capita are lower in nations where women have higher political status, controlling for GDP per capita, urbanization, industrialization, militarization, world-system position, foreign direct investment, the age dependency ratio, and level of democracy. This finding suggests that efforts to improve gender equality around the world may work synergistically with efforts to curtail global climate change and environmental degradation more generally. 
1	We examine the effects of job displacement, an involuntary event associated with socioeconomic and psychological decline, on social participation. Using more than 45 years of panel data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we find that job displacement is associated with significant, long-term lower probabilities of subsequent involvement with various forms of social participation for workers displaced during their prime earnings years; displacement is not associated with lower probabilities of involvement for workers displaced in the years approaching retirement. We also find that post-displacement socioeconomic and psychological decline explain very little of the negative effect of job displacement on social participation, and that a single displacement event, rather than a series of multiple displacement events, is most strongly associated with lower probabilities Of social involvement.

Due to the complexities of such a test, this article discusses limitations of both the standard linear model and Tobit regression when applied to delinquency data coupled with statistical interactions.

1	"Researchers have used status characteristics theory (SCT) to explain the relationship between gender beliefs and interactional disadvantages faced by women in mixed-sex task settings. Several recent studies raise questions about the theory's findings concerning gender differences in influence, leading some to speculate that prestige differences between women and men are disappearing. We share the view that inconsistencies in sex-related differences are often explained by methodological dissimilarities. Possible changes in cultural beliefs about gender are confounded with protocol changes and also differences in communication medium across SCT studies, thereby making it difficult to determine whether recent findings reflect cultural changes or methodological artifacts. We conducted a laboratory experiment examining the effects of gender status and communication medium on influence, controlling for protocol details. The results suggest that gender is ""alive and well"" as a status characteristic and, most interestingly, that partner visibility appears to affect status processes by enhancing status differentiation. Our approach and the implications of our results are discussed with reference to the more general issue of the importance of systematic replication for theory growth in social science research. "

Women lawyers can seek redress for such inequalities through the judicial system, but attorneys are largely hesitant to sue law firms due to the damage such an action could inflict on their future career options.  In lieu of actual litigation, women attorneys might be able to utilize legal discourse to call upon generalized notions of legal rights in order to mobilize individuals to pressure for change within law firm practices.  Internet discussion boards provide a forum for attorneys to engage in such rights discourse under the cover of anonymity, thereby avoiding the career costs associated with litigation.  This paper examines the use of legal discourse by attorneys within one website community in order to ascertain whether the community could serve as a medium for change.  Results indicate that attorneys are already engaging in attempts to mobilize and effect change in internet communities through the use of legal discourse, suggesting that this medium could serve as a vehicle for women attorneys to organize and perhaps alter existing inequalities in the legal practice.
0	Patterns of and desires for subsistence and employment differ considerably among Iñupiat living in Northwest Alaska. Previous study has shown that males and females diverge in their aspirations for education, employment, and outmigration, for example – findings suggesting that the region could face increasing social, economic, and cultural pressures in coming decades as females are more likely to leave small communities in favor of stable, year-round work more likely to be located in more populated areas, while males may be more apt to remain in villages performing subsistence. This paper examines differences in four dependent variables associated with these issues from the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) across gender:  the number of subsistence activities respondents reported participating in during the previous year, the number of hours worked in the previous week in wage employment, whether respondents had considered moving elsewhere within the previous five years, and lifestyle aspirations for wage work only or one characterized by mixed wage and subsistence work. Findings illustrate considerable difference between men and women in factors affecting work patterns and desires, and point to a changing social landscape in the region.
0	Although, gendered organisation of social institutions and the hegemonic cultural expressions of gender differences shape the formation of young womens subjectivities, their perceptions, experiences and ways of dealing with gender inequality vary in accordance with economic and cultural capital of their families, and their experiences in education and the labour market. This paper focuses on the individual experiences of young women in negotiating femininity in Turkey and portrays the circumstances under which young women comply and contest the social, economic and cultural boundaries. It aims contributes to the refinement of our understanding about womens subordination in a Muslim society.

As the story unfolds, however, the matrix is exposed as the system that must undergo radical reconstruction.  At the metaphorical level, the matrix most closely resembles the media, and, insofar as the media is the site at which the film-makers envision social change, the media may well be the conceptual womb of revolution. The film-makers project the conviction that the cultural norms projected by visual media can be re-envisioned on the screen to reflect the embrace of more inclusive and rational norms by a deliberatively democratic public. The film attains the depth of focus to draw viewers into critical reflection not only on the global dimensions of socio-political conflict, but also on the entertainment industrys politically hegemonic effect on undiscerning mass audiences. As we elaborate, the trilogy illuminates, aesthetically rational insights on social science and the normative fabric in which science as a social endeavor is embedded. Our aim is to consider how we might diminish the tension between the linguistic communication and the ocularcentrism that prevails in traditionally modern concepts of public discourse by viewing an inspiring film media that invite thought and deliberation within the public terrain of visual images.
1	"The measurement of social norms plays a pivotal role in many social sciences. While economists predominantly conduct experiments, sociologists rather employ (factorial) surveys. Both methods, however, suffer from distinct weaknesses. Experiments, on the one hand, often fall short in the measurement of more complex elements, such as the conditionality or the level of consensus of social norms. Surveys, on the other, lack the ability to measure actual behavior. This paper argues that the so-called ""strategy method"" compensates for both weaknesses. We can demonstrate the applicability of the strategy method for the measurement of conditionality and consensus of fairness norms which take individual effort into account. To substantiate our claim, we present a methodological experiment comparing results for the strategy ultimatum game with those from a ""conventional"" ultimatum game. We find that offers do not differ, but the acceptance rate is substantially lower in the strategy method experiment compared to the conventional one. This confirms our theoretical expectations that strategy method experiments rather measure normative principles, whereas the ""conventional"" method the willingness to sacrifice own profits to adhere to these principles. Our results are consistent with previous comparative research between factorial surveys and observational data. "

In the Eritrean culture women are viewed as the carriers of tradition and culture. Traditions are passed down from one generation to the next, from mother to daughter. To examine the extent to which Eritrean women immigrants have assimilated to the dominant American culture, 5 Eritrean women were interviewed during the summer of 2004 in Eritrean communities located in the United States; participant observation and follow-up interviews were also conducted. Their ages ranged from 25 to 50. Elder Eritrean women have not fully assimilated into the dominant culture except in the job sector while younger Eritrean women have assimilated in the job sector and in other areas of life such as education, friends, and physical appearances. My hypothesis that the Eritrean women in the US tend to be more traditional then the ones back in Eritrea was not fully supported. The elder Eritrean women have retained their culture while the younger generation have not; what is particularly interesting is that both groups of women migrated to the US around the same time, but their assimilation process differs. In future studies of assimilation, researches must pay greater attention to the ages of the people who migrate within one wave of immigrants in order to get a fuller picture of the complexities of the assimilation process.

Professional wrestling is a performance predicated upon the public affliction of pain, although the participants skillfully and relationally avoid it. Based on the first long-term ethnography of professional wrestling, the article explains the skills that wrestlers cultivate to handle a context of ever-present pain and injury and what these skills tell us about the meanings of pain that wrestlers come to share.  In contrast to the popular notion of pain as harmful or adverse, wrestlers come to understand pain as having several positive meanings.  I suggest that pain is attractive because it is given substantive meaning which encompasses pride and authenticity, sacrifice and protection, dominance and respect, and trust.
0	Drawing the theories of Gans and social constructivism, this research works upon the theory that the media reflects and mediates public views of social problems.  This paper explores preliminary findings of the United States research as part of a cross-cultural comparison of media stereotypes, public views, and local ordinance in the United States and the Netherlands are presented. This research involves content analysis of a newspaper in Las Cruces, NM and semi-structured key informant interviews.  The results state that themes of sympathy, crime, and violence mirror events occurring in Las Cruces during the period of 2000-20003.
1	This article extends research on the consequences of mass imprisonment and the factors shaping population health and health inequalities by considering the associations between imprisonment and population health measured as life expectancy at birth and the infant mortality rate and black-white differences in population health using state-level panel data from the United States (N = 669), 1980-2004. Results show that imprisonment is significantly associated with poorer population health, though associations between imprisonment and infant mortality and female life expectancy are somewhat more consistently statistically significant than are associations with male life expectancy, and associations are more pronounced and statistically significant for blacks than they are for whites. Results also show, however, that increases in imprisonment are associated with decreases in the mortality rates of young black men. Thus, though imprisonment tends to be associated with higher mortality risk and greater black-white differences in mortality, it may, in the short-run, have some paradoxical mortality benefits for young black men. 
0	A central premise of contemporary scholarship on gender and work is that gender is a complex process that fundamentally shapes both work and organizations.  Two mechanisms by which organizations are gendered are (1) the gender typing of occupations and (2) the “ideal worker norm” (Williams, 2000).  These mechanisms are usually considered in isolation but they operate together in the gendering of work and organizations.  In this article, through a content analysis of more than 1,000 temp industry documents from 1946 to 1979, I examine how these mechanisms interact in the gendering—and re-gendering—of temporary employment.  In so doing, this analysis sheds light on the multi-layered and, at times, conflicting ideologies that gender organizational structures.
1	Using data from the 2006 Family Module of the East Asian Social Survey, we use regression-based methods to decompose the sex gap in hourly wages in Japan South Korea and Taiwan We find that Taiwan has the smallest sex gap in wages and is also distinctive in that employed women have more education than men on average Japan is distinctive in the high proportion of women consigned to non-regular (temporary often part-time) jobs and this factor explains much more of the gap in Japan than elsewhere Korea is distinctive in having an extremely high proportion of men who are college graduates therefore in Korea gender differences in education and occupational placement explain more of the gap than elsewhere Despite many historical similarities between these societies our analysis points out the heterogeneity within industrialized East Asia when it comes to gender inequality 
1	"We present a model, the equity-equality equilibrium model, for fairness judgments of reward distributions in work groups. The model is based on reward expectations theory [Berger, Joseph, Fisek, M. Hamit, Norman, Robert Z., Wagner, David G., 1985. Formation of reward expectations in Status Situations. In: Berger, J., Zelditch, M. (Eds.), Status, Rewards, and Influence. Jossey-Bass, Sail Francisco, pp. 215-261] and general considerations of equity theory [Adams, J.S., 1965. Inequity in social exchange. In: Berkowitz, L. (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology. Academic Press, New York; Walster, Elaine, Ellen, Berscheid, Walster, G. William, 1976. New directions in equity research. In: Berkowitz, L., Walster, E. (Eds.), Equity Theory Towards a General Theory of Social Interaction. Academic Press, New York, pp. 226235], and generates precise predictions for what respondents will allocate as the most ""fair"" distribution of rewards across members of work groups. We test our model using data from two different Countries, the United States of America and Turkey, and find that it fits the data well, providing an empirical support for reward expectations theory. The model also provides a measure of where an individual making a fairness judgment stands, on it Continuum of allocation strategy, running from equality to equity. We explore how this measure varies across groups, discuss its relationship to justice-relevant variables, and consider some implications of the model for understanding allocation behaviors. "
1	Generalized trust in other Americans has never been so low. Explanations of this decline draw attention to the role of generational replacement and to period effects stemming from macro-level economic and political changes. In this paper, I consider generational and period trends in trust for black and for white Americans. Although race is considered one of the most important predictors of levels of trust, few studies have analyzed how race relates to larger generational and period trends of decline. General Social Survey data is used to test whether the decline thesis applies equally to black and to white Americans' trust levels. I consider both the widely used index of generalized trust and the individual items comprising this index. The results show that although the war baby generation (1935-1944) of white Americans was more trusting than other generations, there has been no corresponding variability across generations for black Americans. At the period level, while there has been a decline in generalized trust and each of its sub-components for white Americans, the period-based trends for black Americans are more variable across measures. The use of a general index to study trends for black Americans masks important period-based trends. The decline in trust is related to race and what is missing from most accounts of the race gap in trust is a discussion of structural forces that advantage white Americans and hence inflate their trust levels. 
0	We investigate two competing predictions about the effect of peer schools’ quality levels (as measured by network-weighted average SAT scores) on the U.S. News & World Report rankings of colleges and universities. Peers are defined in two ways: by structural equivalence and by rank proximity. The former defines colleges or universities as structurally equivalent in a given year to the extent that they both (i) identify the same schools as “overlaps” in the application market and (ii) are themselves cited as “overlaps” by the same schools in the application market. The latter suggests that the closer two schools are in the rankings, the greater their influence on one another. Utilizing these proximity measures to construct two weighted variables of peer-school quality – rank- and citation-based peer SAT averages – we find that peers have differing effects on the rankings of colleges and universities. Using pooled cross-sectional and within-school ordered probit models, we find that as universities’ citation-weighted peers improve their student quality, a focal school does better in subsequent rankings. Conversely, as the student quality of colleges’ rank-weighted peers improves, a focal school does worse on subsequent rankings. Possible mechanisms for these results and their divergence, along with future directions, are discussed.
0	Recent research found that training men and women to understand the role of bystanders in situations where violence against women occurs may reduce the incidence of that violence. We developed, piloted and displayed a campus-wide outreach campaign based on the bystander approach. The goal of the outreach campaign was to model safe and prosocial intervention behaviors in a series of posters displayed across a northeastern public university for four weeks. During the last week of the campaign, we asked undergraduates to complete a web-based public awareness questionnaire that examined their knowledge of prosocial bystander behaviors shown in the campaign posters. In this paper, we examine whether students who reported seeing or recognizing themselves in the posters exhibited greater bystander knowledge than those students who did not report seeing themselves. We first review the theoretical framework of the in-person bystander program and briefly describe the in-person prevention program. Then we describe the conceptual framework that we used to create the bystander outreach campaign and the development of that community outreach campaign.  We then present our methods and then results of our data analyses that indicate a strong relationship between recognizing ones self in the posters and internalizing the campaign message. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future outreach campaigns oriented towards social problems.

It explores the meanings of participation and of democracy, as well as the costs and benefits as they are understood by the movements. It compares the movements structures of democracy, decision-making, and development. The movements are: the Zapatistas (México), the Movimento Sem Terra (Brazil), workers cooperatives (Argentina), Chavismo (Venezuela).
0	In order to increase quantitative literacy, many community colleges, four-year colleges, and universities have started to incorporate mathematics across the curriculum mandatory requirements for their students. While attending the National Science Foundations Math Across the Community College Curriculum (MAC^3) Conference in January, 2007, we began the foundation for a linked or team-taught course that would create a learning community that fosters an appreciation for and an understanding of the origin of sociological knowledge through statistics. In general, there are two sets of problems at the community college level. In sociology, students tend to think that sociological knowledge (knowledge about general social patterns in the population and generalizations about the culture) originates from the researchers or professors imagination. One of the main goals for an introductory sociology course is to teach students that research findings gathered from random samples of the population form the bases for statements about general social patterns in society. In statistics, students tend to think that statistics is just another mathematics class composed of manipulation of numbers, formulas and the dreaded word problems and, thus, the classes are considered difficult or boring and even scary. Students can be overwhelmed when the skills and the technology for statistical analysis are not approached within the context of issue or problem that is relevant to their society. In the proposed roundtable, we will share our plans for the course and hear discussions of others experiences and ideas about this important, burgeoning educational need and trend.
1	This study explores time trends in public trust in science in the United States from 1974 to 2010. More precisely, I test Mooney's (2005) claim that conservatives in the United States have become increasingly distrustful of science. Using data from the 1974 to 2010 General Social Survey, I examine group differences in trust in science and group-specific change in these attitudes over time. Results show that group differences in trust in science are largely stable over the period, except for respondents identifying as conservative. Conservatives began the period with the highest trust in science, relative to liberals and moderates, and ended the period with the lowest. The patterns for science are also unique when compared to public trust in other secular institutions. Results show enduring differences in trust in science by social class, ethnicity, gender, church attendance, and region. I explore the implications of these findings, specifically, the potential for political divisions to emerge over the cultural authority of science and the social role of experts in the formation of public policy.
1	"In recent years, social scientists have identified not just heterosexism and homophobia as social problems, but also heteronormativity-the mundane, everyday ways that heterosexuality is privileged and taken for granted as normal and natural. There is little empirical research, however on how heterosexuality is reproduced and then normalized for individuals. Using survey data from more than 600 mothers of young children, ages 3 to 6 years old, this article examines how mothers normalize heterosexuality for young children. The data suggest that most mothers, who are parenting in a gendered and heteronormative context to begin with, assume that their children are heterosexual, describe romantic and adult relationships to children as only heterosexual, and make gays and lesbians invisible to their children. Those who consider that their children could some day be gay tend to adopt one of three strategies in response: Most pursue a passive strategy of ""crossing their fingers"" and hoping otherwise. A very few try to prepare their children for the possibility of being gay. A larger group, primarily mothers from conservative Protestant religions, work to prevent homosexuality. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for understanding sexual identity development and the construction of heteronormativity."
1	This project explores cohort and period trends in political participation in the United States between 1973 and 2008. We examine the extent to which protest attendance and petition signing have diffused to different kinds of actors across multiple generations; we test claims central to understanding trends in social movement participation. Using aggregated, cross-sectional survey data on political involvement from 34,241 respondents, we examine changes in the probability of ever having attended a protest or signed a petition over time periods and across cohorts using cross-classified, random-effects models. We find a strong generational effect on the probability of ever having attended a protest, which explains much of the observed change in self-reports of protest behavior. More than half of this generational effect is a result of compositional change, but we find little evidence that protest attendance diffused to new types of actors. We compare these findings with a less confrontational form of protesting, petition signing, which shows more period than cohort effects. We argue that social movement activities have not become a widespread means of civic engagement.
0	In contemporary theorizing about social movements identity has become a widely used concept, but one with varied and ambiguous meanings.  We draw upon analyses of several types of identity to highlight the role of movement identity, and then proceed to offer a measure of such identity vis-à-vis the Environmental Movement.   Our theoretically grounded use of an indicator of orbits of involvement in/support for the environmental movement (active participant, sympathetic but not active, neutral and unsympathetic appears to have good face/content validity, and then we present a wide range of data drawn from Gallups 2000 Earth Day survey to examine its predictive/construct validity.  We find that responses to this measure are significantly related in the expected direction to membership in national and local environmental organizations, to a variety of indicators of assessments (from pro to con) of the contemporary environmental movement, and to a wide range of self-reported pro-environmental behaviors (including both lifestyle and political behaviors).  We conclude by suggesting that use of this measure will enable social movement analysts to explore a number of key issues that are relevant to the growing number of calls for more attention to the linkages between public opinion and movement dynamics.
1	We use hierarchical cross-classified random-effects models to simultaneously measure age, period, and cohort patterns of mortality risk between 1986 and 2006 for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black men and women with less than a high school education, a high school education, and more than a high school education. We examine all-cause mortality risk and mortality risk from heart disease, lung cancer, and unpreventable cancers. Findings reveal that temporal reductions in black and white men's and women's mortality rates were driven entirely by cohort changes in mortality. Findings also demonstrate that disparate cohort effects between education groups widened the education gap in all-cause mortality risk and mortality risk from heart disease and lung cancer across this time period. Educational disparities in mortality risk from unpreventable cancers, however, did not change. This research uncovers widening educational differences in adult mortality and demonstrates that a cohort perspective provides valuable insights for understanding recent temporal changes in U.S. mortality risk.
0	Criminal prosecutions and trials are normal events of the life cycle of most protest efforts and often have important consequences for the struggle between social movements and their opponents.  Despite their significance, these legal and political events have been ignored by the fields of law and society and of social movements since a few initial works some twenty to thirty years ago. This paper reviews the study of political prosecutions and trials, sketches their importance  for social movements at various times in U.S. history, and outlines several areas for future research on what Kirchheimer (1961) called political justice. More generally, it argues that the study of the social control of social movements will remain impoverished unless and until it begins to address the dynamics and consequences of the criminal prosecution and trial of political protesters.
0	In North America, the growing incidence of poverty among recent immigrants concerns academics as well as policy makers.  Using data from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada, this paper investigates the factors that contribute to exits from poverty among the immigrants who arrived in the early 2000s.  Two possible explanations are examined: post-migration investments in human capital and opportunity structures of the host society.  The logistic regression analyses yield three main findings.  First, accumulation of human capital after migration, such as job-related training, language lessons, and work experience, increases the chances of exits from poverty.  Second, although human capital investment plays an important role, its effects are overshadowed by the effects of the opportunity structures of the host country.  Finally, some ethnic minority groups (African, Arab, West Asian, and Caribbean origins) are more likely to struggle in overcoming poverty, which suggests the negative impact of ethnic stratification.  These findings bear policy implications for the possible pathways to successful immigrant incorporation, including ways to upgrade newcomers skills and to remove institutional barriers.
1	We examine relationships between childhood abuse and two maladaptive marital communication patterns - hostile and withdrawing - and test whether covenant marriage or pre-marital counseling mediate the effects of childhood abuse. Drawing on a sample from the Marriage Matters (1997-2004) data, we find both gendered differences in communication and in the relationship between childhood abuse and negative communication patterns. Wives are more likely to use a hostile style of communication, whereas husbands are more likely to use a withdrawing style. We also find that childhood abuse affects hostile communication for both spouses but influences only wives' withdrawing. Neither covenant marriage nor pre-marital counseling is associated with hostile communication for either spouse. Covenant marriage increases husbands' withdrawal from conflict, whereas pre-marital counseling increases the use of withdrawing communication in both wives and husbands. 
0	This paper examines acculturation - the cultural effects on immigrant health facility access by analyzing New Immigrant Survey (NIS) 2003 data on recent immigrants from 5 Asian countries: China, India, Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The construction of acculturation is based on the new theoretical model of acculturation. If we compare the three logistic regression models on health insurance coverage, health facility utilization and alternative medicine utilization, we can find that acculturation is a good predictor of health insurance coverage but not for the other two. Of the significant predictors, language assimilation is the most important. This basically reaffirms the authority of the old model of acculturation. However, the fact that social network is not a very significant predictor might also derive from the fact that network data are not specifically designed to get at social network data. A more nuanced tool might render social network variable a more significant one.
1	This article uses time-series data from 1900 to 2005 to explore the effects of rivalry between labor unions as a special case of inter-organizational competition. Holding constant economic and political factors that typically account for changes in union density, we investigate how competition from rival labor federations and from independent unions affect both union density and a measure for the density of the dominant federation (AFL/AFL-CIO), adjusted for membership changes from mergers and splits. We measure competition by the number of unions and the size of rivals. While much existing literature measures state regulation with categorical coding for specific periods, we measure the effect of state enforcement directly with counts of pro-labor and pro-management unfair labor practice cases adjudicated by the National Labor Relations Board. We assess the effect of left-wing political culture using the popular vote for socialist and communist candidates in presidential elections. Both the number of members in rival unions and the total number of rival unions positively impact the rate of change in overall union density and in AFL density. The size of independent unions has a negative impact on AFL/AFL-CIO density but no effect on overall union density. Unfair labor practices cases adjudicated for employers negatively affect union density but positively affect AFL/AFL-CIO density, while cases adjudicated for unions negatively affect AFL/AFL-CIO density.
1	I construct covariate-adjusted increment-decrement life tables to estimate racial differences in the duration of children's exposure to neighborhood poverty and affluence. Using geocoded data from the 1999 and 2001 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I estimate that black children born in 1999 can expect to spend about 9 of their first 18 years in poor neighborhoods, compared to less than 2 years for white children. Bivariate inequality in childhood exposure is reduced by 16% after controlling for racial differences in household characteristics, by 39% after controlling for differences in the racial composition and spatial location of children's neighborhoods, and by 46% after controlling for both sets of factors. These findings indicate that household and especially urban ecological factors strongly affect the amount of time that black and white children can expect to spend in poor and nonpoor neighborhoods throughout childhood. I conclude by discussing some policy implications of the findings. 
0	Despite the overall decrease in fertility in South Africa over the last few decades, adolescent fertility has remained relatively constant over time  with women of today experiencing the same levels of teen pregnancy as the women of their mothers generation.  While descriptive statistics about a childs sexual debut exist, few studies attempt to empirically discover why children have sex, especially those who do so at an early age.  The current investigation explores potential links between structural factors such as parental presence and residential stability and a childs decision to engage in early sexual behavior.  Using the Cape Area Panel Study, I employ discrete-time event history/survival models to parameterize these effects.  Overall, I find that parental presence, particularly father presence, reduces the hazard of early sex for girls depending on population group.  There is weak evidence that residential moves increase the hazard of early sex for boys, depending on population group.
0	Researchers interested in the areas of gender and sexuality have found that whether or not a man is perceived as being sufficiently masculine  whether or not he is seen as a real man  is intimately connected with his sexual behavior.  This is to say that perceptions of a mans masculinity are largely dependent on his heterosexuality  or minimally the appearance of being heterosexual.  Research has also shown that ones attitudes about masculinity affect ones beliefs about sexual practices.  The goal of this paper is to explore this connection between masculinity and sexuality.  Specifically, it looks at the extent to which the attitudes of adolescent males about masculinity influence their beliefs about the appropriateness of premarital sex and the extent to which their attitudes about premarital sex in turn influence their ideas about masculinity.  Using data from the 1995 National Survey of Adolescent Males, a system of equations is defined in which masculinity ideology and attitudes about premarital sex are each endogenous variables.  Preliminary support is found that attitudes about sex affect ones masculine ideology while there seems to be less support for the claim that masculine ideology influences ones sexual beliefs.
1	This article examines the influence of resource dependence and institutional processes on post-Civil Rights Act changes in private sector workplace segregation. We use data collected by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1966 through 2000 to examine organizations embedded within their firm, industry, local labor market and federal regulatory environments. Sex segregation declines precipitously from 1966 through 2000, but we see little evidence that organizations in the same industrial environment have established a stable pattern of segregation and integration. In other words, sex segregation has not been institutionalized. Race segregation, on the other hand, shows strong and increasing evidence of institutionalization, but weak declines after 1980. Firm visibility, field concentration and federal contractor density, but not direct federal affirmative action reporting, prove to be particularly important for understanding changes in segregation levels and institutionalization within industries. Results point to the importance of organizational fields and labor queues for motivating both persistence and change in workplace inequality.
1	"In their concerted efforts to unpack the microprocesses that transform repeated exchanges into an exchange relation, exchange theorists have paid little attention to how actors perceive changes and dynamics in exchanges over time. We help fill this gap by studying how temporal patterns of exchange affect the development of cohesion. Some exchange relations develop gradually as actors hedge their bets, making incremental commitments to ""test the water"" and manage the risks of exchange (incremental exchange). Other relations settle quickly into full commitment as actors take ""leaps of faith"" in each other (constant exchange). Do these patterns result in different levels of bonding? We examined this question across a series of two laboratory studies and a vignette survey that manipulated two dimensions of repeated exchange: resource level (how much actors exchange in each interaction) and frequency (how often actors exchange). In each study, participants played or imagined a series of social exchange tasks with a fixed partner. Results show that exchanging incrementally in resource level promotes cohesion, but exchanging incrementally in frequency undermines it. These findings affirm the importance of exchange frequency for cohesion, but demonstrate an opposite effect of resource level: compared to exchanging constant and full levels, exchanging incremental levels of resources creates more cohesion, even while resulting in lower instrumental benefits."
1	What role do children play in education and stratification? Are they merely passive recipients of unequal opportunities that schools and parents create for them? Or do they actively shape their own opportunities? Through a longitudinal, ethnographic study of one socioeconomically diverse, public elementary school, I show that children's social-class backgrounds affect when and how they seek help in the classroom. Compared to their working-class peers, middle-class children request more help from teachers and do so using different strategies. Rather than wait for assistance, they call out or approach teachers directly, even interrupting to make requests. In doing so, middle-class children receive more help from teachers, spend less time waiting, and are better able to complete assignments. By demonstrating these skills and strategies, middle-class children create their own advantages and contribute to inequalities in the classroom. These findings have implications for theories of cultural capital, stratification, and social reproduction.

There is a vast literature about how the migration experience affects migrants in terms of health behaviors, employment, education, language acquisition, and illegal activities.  However, we know very little about what migrants believe, what values they hold, and how these change.  With new ethnographic insights and innovations in survey measurement of values, social scientists are beginning to accumulate evidence that values and beliefs are important for the well-being of individuals and can drive their behaviors and interactions with individuals and institutions around them.  Of course migrants are often a special group of people, who arrive in the destination with a very different set of values and beliefs than the locally born population.  Migrants, and their interactions with destination and origin peoples, might in fact be one of the strongest catalysts of social change in host countries, origin communities, and within migrants themselves.  Thus understanding their values and beliefs and processes of change is key to understanding their well-being and social change in general. We study these issues among people from Nepal who migrate to the Gulf Countries of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Oman. We interviewed families and households in Nepal and people who had migrated to one of the six Gulf countries.
0	This paper addresses tenant compliance with the Department of Housing and Urban Developments 1996 One Strike and Youre Out policy which was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 2002. The regulation requires public housing leases to stipulate that if a public housing tenant, any member of the tenants household, or any guest or other person under the tenants control engages in criminal activity or any drug-related criminal activity on or off premises, tenancy will be terminated. My interest in this paper is on the set of obligations public housing tenants are compelled to abide by in the signing of a lease  to scrutinize the behaviors of family members, their friends, and visitors within the home and outside of it. In total, these expectations form an affirmative obligation on the part of leaseholders to prevent criminal activities through control of third party behavior, hence implicating each tenant of public housing in a system of social regulation and control. I do not intend that such compliance is completely willing; indeed, the presence of real and negative consequences for violation of the policy means that it is compelled. Nonetheless, I contend there is much to be gained by a focus on the majority of people who do not violate certain civil legal prescriptions  that through their compliance, we can see the mostly pernicious ways the state has slipped control, surveillance and regulation into ordinary everyday behaviors of specific populations.
0	The paper discusses the research findings of two case studies conducted in two English rural villages in 2005.  The paper focuses upon expressions of community made by village residents.  First, it considers definitions of rural community expressed by twenty-first century villagers; second, it moves to consider the extent to which each of the case study villages represented a community and; finally, the paper examines whether this has changed or is considered to be under threat  and whether what villagers consider is changing and whether this acts as a barrier to cohesion.
1	Prior work on equal employment opportunity tends to focus on a limited set of factors that influence change in organizational structures and policies. This article considers a broader set of potentially influential legal and political coercive pressures-namely, discrimination lawsuits, federal court dynamics, and state political ideology-and analyzes their implications for concrete changes in organizational behavior Using national establishment-level data on the supermarket industry from 1983 to 1998, 1 estimate African American managerial representation using a series of auto-distributed lag (ADL) models with fixed-effects. The results show that in the year following a lawsuit filing against a particular supermarket establishment, African Americans are more likely to enter management. Furthermore, over the long run, coercive isomorphism (whereby establishments subject to a lawsuit come to adopt industry averages for African American managerial representation) seems to prevail. Finally, legal pressures associated with federal court judges 'gender and racial/ethnic diversity and state-level government ideology are also influential. I conclude by discussing these results and the importance of systematically incorporating political process into sociological theorizing and analyses of workplace diversity
1	This article combines relational perspectives on gender identity with social network structural perspectives on health to understand men's sexual functioning. The authors argue that network positions that afford independence and control over social resources are consistent with traditional masculine roles and may therefore affect men's sexual performance. For example, when a heterosexual man's female partner has more frequent contact with his confidants than he does which the authors refer to as partner betweenness his relational autonomy, privacy, and control are constrained. Analyses of data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) show that about a quarter of men experience partner betweennessa and that these men are 92% more likely to report erectile dysfunction. Partner betweenness is strongest among the youngest men in the sample, which may reflect changing conceptions of masculinity in later life. The authors consider several explanations for these findings and urge additional research on the links between health, gender, and network structure.
1	The autonomy perspective of housework time predicts that wives' housework time falls steadily as their earnings rise, because wives use additional financial resources to outsource or forego time in housework. We argue, however, that wives' ability to reduce their housework varies by household task. That is, we expect that increases in wives' earnings will allow them to forego or outsource some tasks, but not others. As a result, we hypothesize more rapid declines in wives' housework time for low-earning wives as their earnings increase than for high-earning wives who have already stopped performing household tasks that are the easiest and cheapest to outsource or forego. Using fixed-effects models and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find considerable support for our hypothesis. We further conclude that past evidence that wives who out-earn their husbands spend additional time in housework to compensate for their gender-deviant success in the labor market is due to the failure to account for the non-linear relationship between wives' absolute earnings and their housework time. 
1	While work experience is generally seen as an indicator of human capital, it may also reflect the accumulation of social capital. This study examines how work experience facilitates informal access to employment that is, being matched with a new employer through an informal search or informal recruitment through the non-search process (without engaging in a job search). Results from fixed effects regression on panel data from the NLSY show that experience is related to informal entry into new jobs, though in a very specific way. The odds of being informally recruited into a new job improve as work experience in related occupations rises, but this relationship holds only among men. These findings highlight the social benefits of occupation-specific work experience that accrue to men but not to women, suggesting an alternative explanation for the gender disparity in wage returns to experience. 
1	America's changing color line is perhaps best expressed in shifting patterns of neighborhood residential segregation-the geographic separation of races. This research evaluates black exceptionalism by using the universe of U.S. blocks from the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses to provide a single geographically inclusive national estimate (Theirs H) of black residential segregation from whites and other groups, which can be additively decomposed into its within (e.g., neighborhood segregation within places) and between components (e.g., racial differences between places). The results show that America's blacks are living in blocks that are roughly two-thirds less racially diverse than the U.S. population overall. Nationally, neighborhood segregation processes account for half, or even less, of blacks' segregation from whites, Hispanics and Asians. Declining big-city micro-segregation has been muted by increasing or persistent macro-segregation. Moreover, with growing neighborhood segregation in the suburbs and fringe, America's central cities-the focus of most previous studies-now account for only a minority share of all neighborhood or micro-level segregation between blacks and whites. Evidence of black incorporation or spatial assimilation must account for other levels of geography that extend beyond the traditional focus on neighborhood segregation in big cities.
1	We examine victims' dissatisfaction with the police and the courts as a function of their gender, their relationship to the offender, and whether they were physically or sexually assaulted. Analyses of the National Violence Against Women (and Men) Survey reveal that victims are more dissatisfied with the police when the offender is someone they know than when the offender is a stranger, regardless of gender and regardless of whether the offender is a family member or intimate partner. Victims who know the offender are more likely to complain that the police were too lenient and that the police did not believe them. Victims of sexual assault are more likely than victims of physical assault to be dissatisfied with the police and the courts. They complain more about police insensitivity, but they are not more likely to complain about leniency, skepticism, of their charges or not being taken seriously. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1	We employ newly developed methods to disentangle age, period and cohort effects on non-marital fertility ratios from 1972 through 2002 for black and white women ages 20-44 in the United States. We focus on three cohort factors: family structure, school enrollment and the sex ratio. For both blacks and whites, cohorts with less traditional family structures have higher NFRs. Other results differ by race. The impact of school enrollment on NFRs is significantly negative for whites, but significantly positive for blacks. The impact of sex ratio is significantly negative for blacks, but insignificant for whites. If black women and white women had cohort characteristics typical of the other group, age specific NFRs for black women would decline markedly, while those for whites would increase markedly.
1	After 25 years of intense scrutiny, social capital remains an important yet highly debated concept in social science research. This research uses data from youth and mentors in several chapters of Big Brothers/Big Sisters to assess the importance of different mentoring relationship characteristics in creating positive outcomes among youths. The literature on social capital suggests that key characteristics are: (1. the amount of time spent between individuals, (2. racial similarity, (3. level of trust, (4. social class difference, and (5. intergenerational closure. I examine the effects of these social capital measures on academic and deviant behavioral outcomes and run models using propensity score weights to address selection bias. The results indicate that both the amount of time spent in a relationship and the level of trust consistently have positive effects for youths. Counter to what some theory suggests, race-matching and closure between parent and mentor have limited effects, and social class difference between individuals has no significant effect on any of the examined outcomes. These findings have important implications for future work on social capital and adolescent relationships in general.
0	As the United States moves towards greater government involvement in health care it is appropriate to look to Canada for examples of risk factors whose incidence might be reduced through health promotion policies. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is known to be associated with negative outcomes for children, including low birth-weight and longer term effects.  Physiological studies leave little doubt that the relationship is causal. In Canada, despite the work of health promotion programs the incidence of smoking among pregnant women is still too high, particularly in marginalized populations. Results from a recent longitudinal survey confirm that maternal smoking during pregnancy has long-term deleterious effects on child outcome measures. We also demonstrate that, while maternal smoking during pregnancy has undergone a gradual decline over the thirteen years since 1994, there are persistent provincial differences that are only partly explained by the different population composition of the various provinces. Maternal smoking is linked with poverty, welfare dependency and family structure. Québec has higher rates of maternal smoking, net of other factors and British Columbia the lowest. Further analyses demonstrate provincial differences and time trends in other maternal behaviors, including the length of time devoted to breast-feeding, post-partum smoking and alcohol consumption.
1	Information on the institutional arrangements of citizenship is increasingly available. However, we currently have only limited knowledge on the contours of public opinion towards citizenship. We seek to remedy this neglect by documenting patterns of support toward the most dominant citizenship principles: jus soli, jus sanguinis, and jus domicile. Specifically, we combine responses to questions on these principles to create a single measure of opinion toward citizenship law that encompasses three dominant citizenship approaches: assimilationist, exclusionary, and pluralist. Using data from the 2003 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) module on National Identity, we examine cross-national differences in support for the three approaches. Our results indicate that only two regime-types can clearly be identified - a pluralist regime, which centers on the importance of jus soli and includes traditional settler societies and Sweden, and an assimilationist regime, which is typified by its acceptance of jus domicile and includes the post-colonial empires of France and Britain. On the individual level, our analysis highlights the importance of perceptions of threat, either economically or culturally, in shaping public opinion toward citizenship. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

0	As of yet researchers and policy makers have a very rudimentary understanding of the retirement process as it relates to women, and especially what retirement means for minority women.  Nor do we understand how a womens family and employment history effects her economic situation in later life.  This paper represents an initial attempt to address these important questions.  This analysis shows that minorities deviate significantly from the normative transition of work to retirement.  Furthermore, race works differently for men and women in affecting retirement.  Finally, there are strong effects of family history on employment patterns for women, which are not present for men.  Particularly noticeable is the differences in the decreased likelihood that black women identify as homemakers than do non-Hispanic white women.  More broadly stated, the results for women indicate the importance of family life to employment life for half of the elderly population.  The significant effects of both work and family history on womens retirement patterns speak to the interrelatedness of these two spheres.  However, for the most part public policy does not consider this.  Policy implications and directions for further research are included.
0	Using data from 325 Tsunami-affected mothers and adolescents from two villages in southern Sri Lanka, this study investigated direct and indirect influences of Tsunami exposure on mothers depressive and PTSD symptoms. Findings generally support the hypothesized model in that life and property destruction contribute to depressive and PTSD symptoms of mothers. Mothers mental health is also strongly associated with the mental health of their children. Detrimental influences of Tsunami exposure operate through the generation of more proximal post-Tsunami risks such as prolonged displacement and creation of family problems. In addition, religious participation, familism, number of children, intact family status and community support reduced mothers depressive symptoms. Finally, intact family status and high religious participation of mothers moderate the detrimental influences of Tsunami exposure on mother PTSD symptoms. These findings can directly contribute to improving ongoing recovery and reconstruction programs and help formulate future programs for Tsunami-affected and other natural disaster-affected families.
0	During the Great Depression global political and economic circumstances colluded in such a way as to encourage the USA to treat poverty as a social rather than an individual-level problem. In the 1930s, abjuring sympathy for its economically depressed citizens could have invoked a dangerous climate in which Americans might have been motivated to view the USSRs worker-oriented political system more favorably. Subsequently, poverty definitions and policies have been blown about capriciously with the regular shift of political and economic tides.
1	Social scientists describe culture as either coherent or incoherent and political dissent as either unifying or divisive. This article moves beyond such dichotomies. Content, historical, and network analyses of public debates on how to organize four lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Washington marches provide evidence for an integrative position. Rather than just describe consistencies or contradictions, we contend that the key analytic challenge is to explain the organization of differences. We propose one way of doing this using the mechanism of a cultural anchor. Within and across marches, a small collection of ideas remains fixed in the national conversation, yet in a way that allows activists to address their internal diversity and respond to unfolding historical events. These results suggest that activists do not simply organize around their similarities but, through cultural anchors, they use their commonalities to build a thinly coherent foundation that can also support their differences. Situated at the nexus of culture, social movements, sexualities, and networks, this article demonstrates how the anchoring mechanism works in the context of LGBT political organizing.
1	"This article uses the Hapa movement as a case study in order to provide a framework for understanding identity as a goal of social movements and to expand on a theoretical understanding of multiracial social movements. In contrast to current understandings of identity-based movements, this article argues that the Hapa movement seeks simultaneously to deconstruct traditional notions of (mono) racial identities and to secure recognition for a multiracial ""Hapa"" identity. Movements that have identity as a goal are motivated by activists' understandings of how categories are constituted and how those categories, codes, and ways of thinking serve as axes of regulation and domination. The Hapa movement simultaneously challenges (mono) racial categories at both the institutional level through targeting the state and at the micro level through challenging the quotidian enactment of race and promulgating a Hapa identity. Activism by mixed-race individuals and organizations constitutes an important challenge to power that has significant implications for racial categorization and classification in contemporary American society."
1	This study conducts a systematic age, period, and cohort analysis that provides new evidence of the dynamics of and heterogeneity in, subjective well-being across the life course and over time in the United States. I use recently developed methodologies of hierarchical age-period-cohort models, and the longest available population data series on happiness from the General Social Survey, 1972 to 2004. I find distinct life-course patterns, time trends, and birth cohort changes in happiness. The age effects are strong and indicate increases in happiness over the life course. Period effects show first decreasing and then increasing trends in happiness. Baby-boomer cohorts report lower levels of happiness, suggesting the influence of early life conditions and formative experiences. I also find substantial life-course and period variations in social disparities in happiness. The results show convergences in sex, race, and educational gaps in happiness with age, which can largely be attributed to differential exposure to various social conditions important to happiness, such as marital status and health. Sex and race inequalities in happiness declined in the long term over the past 30 years. During the most recent decade, however the net sex difference disappeared while the racial gap in happiness remained substantial.
0	Wilson (1987) spearheaded the argument that concentrated levels of poverty in a neighborhood have deleterious consequences for its residents.  Central to this notion is that socioeconomic homogeneity leaves residents socially isolated, without relationships or exposure to working and middle class people. These arguments have pushed policymakers to consider ways in which public housing residents can have access to diverse social networks.  Consequently, many formerly low-income housing developments are changing through the Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere VI (HOPE VI) program and other initiatives  into mixed-income developments. Using longitudinal ethnographic data collected in Chicago and Boston, we ask if context matters when it comes to developing heterogeneity in the social networks of low-income African-American women living in a mixed income development and Latin-American women living in a traditionally homogeneous public housing development. Our findings indicate that context does not matter; instead  the development, composition, and activation of social networks were more reflective of the cultural background and the historical nature of race relations in the locality.
1	Using a sample of households nested in census tracts in 24 metropolitan areas over four time points, this study provides a robust test of the determinants of neighborhood satisfaction, taking into account the census tract context. Consistent with social disorganization theory, the presence of racial/ethnic heterogeneity and single-parent households consistently reduced neighborhood satisfaction. Those perceiving more social or physical disorder were considerably less satisfied with the neighborhood, and perceiving more crime showed an accelerating negative effect on satisfaction. Furthermore, the effect of perceiving crime was exacerbated in tracts with a distressed labor market or the presence of disengaged youth. There was consistent evidence that those with more economic investment (homeowners) or social investment (married residents and parents) in the neighborhood are more satisfied. On the other hand, longer-term residents did not report more satisfaction, nor did general residential stability in the tract increase satisfaction.
1	"Scholarly literature and the media often tout ""networking"" as an effective route for obtaining quality employment. Some scholars, however, have cautioned that racially segregated social networks may produce racially segregated workgroups and differential opportunity structures over time. Drawing from theoretical perspectives pertaining to social closure and analyzing data from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, this article analyses the role of social contacts and race/ethnic matching in employment. The findings reveal that among individuals using contacts in Job searches, same-race contacts dramatically increase race/ethnic matching for all status groups. On the other hand, using a cross-race contact, while a rare event, strongly discourages this process. The results also show that race/ethnic matching is reduced with increases in educational attainment and in larger workplaces. Further analyses highlighting the quality of Jobs attained through same- and cross-race social contacts show that cross-race contacts do not provide access to higher paying jobs nor jobs with authority They do, however, increase access to lower-level supervisory positions for blacks and Hispanics."
0	Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in two day care centers  the Green Mountain Child Care Center in College Town, Vermont and the Rocky Mountain Christian Day Care in Coalville, Wyoming  the authors demonstrate differences between centers serving different segments of the population.  The authors rely on Annette Lareaus (2003) concepts of concerted cultivation and the accomplishment of natural growth as a way to describe these differences.  The authors then reflect on the potential consequences of different styles of child care for the skills, attitudes and orientations developed by young children.
0	"The organization of a rugby team is utilitarian and calls attention to individual positions and skills, while emphasizing the importance of the collective for success on the field. Although teams may undergo changes overtime, rugby culture emphasizes a core identity that teams strive to maintain. Women's rugby teams act as a site for the resistance of dominant discourses of normative femininity, allowing female rugby players to identify with a larger group of women who play the sport. However, these teams may also defensively engage in maintaining a heterosexual identity to combat the stereotype of ""butchness"" often associated with women's rugby players. This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding how members of women’s rugby teams evidence Simmel’s theory of sociability and group identities, and navigates the different identities that emerge from participation in the sport. Using examples from recent ethnographies conducted by Matthew Ezzell and Laura Chase, this paper examines the mechanisms at play to construct sociability on the teams in question."
0	Within most of the existing literature on work and occupations, the labor market is often discussed and analyzed in a binary context (e.g., men's versus women's work).  Because work-especially that performed in an advanced capitalist society-is stratified along social, cultural, and ideological boundaries, I propose that (re)conceptualizations of work must employ multidimensional perspectives.  To this end, I argue that the stratified composition and social statuses of men's and women's work is-in part-symptomatic of the intersecting boundaries of race, class, and gender-naming only a few.  Further, by unmasking how the intersection of race, class, and gender (re)constructs a stratified labor market, future analyses of work may develop (1) more complex and accurate conceptualizations of work, (2) more sophisticated analyses of the social inequities both between and within occupations, and (3) a multifaceted framework that situates the work (in)experiences of different workers in a socio-historical context that is racialized, gendered, and classed.
1	"We test competing hypotheses from political-economic and neo-liberal theories about the effects of economic growth and urbanization on a neglected, but important, indicator of environmental health: aquatic biodiversity. We analyze cross-national data on the number of threatened fish species within national territorial waters using negative binomial regression. We find that, counter to the expectations of neo-liberal theories, economic growth increases the likelihood of fish species becoming threatened within nations. Urbanization, however, appears to have no additional effect. The ""environmental Kuznets curve"" does not hold for aquatic biodiversity, suggesting that further economic growth in nations is likely to escalate the biodiversity crisis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0	This paper examines whether new private schools are innovative, drawing on theories of markets and institutions. Choice advocates claim that markets spark innovation, while Institutional theory suggests that isomorphic forces will limit novel school forms. Using qualitative data from third sector private schools in Toronto, three hypotheses about the impact of markets on education organizations are examined: i) they reverse tendencies towards isomorphism as schools develop client niches; ii) they allow schools to weaken their formal structures, and iii) they force schools to more closely monitor their effectiveness. Substantial evidence exists for the first hypothesis, partial evidence for the second hypothesis, but little evidence for the third. Overall, new private schools are characterized by: small classes, unique pedagogical themes, personalized treatment of clients, and some pragmatic responses to limited resources. Their operators sometimes feel restricted by parental demand, but are able to retain a loosely coupled structure by embracing consumerist understandings of accountability. This chapter concludes with a discussion of implications for market theory.
0	In this paper, I consider the activities of a group of individuals who tinker with and build radio hardware in an informal setting called Geek Night.  The actors conceive of Geek Night as both play or leisure and radical pedagogical activity, which constitutes an aspect of activism surrounding citizen access to low power FM radio.  They are also concerned with combating the gendered nature of hardware skills, yet in spite of their efforts men tend to have more skill and familiarity with radio hardware than women.  Radio tinkering has a long history as a masculine undertaking and a site of masculine identity construction; I argue that this case represents an interplay between geek, activist, and gendered identities, all of which are salient for these actors, but which do not occur without some tension.
0	The sources of political attitudes are among the most studied phenomena of modern politics. Moving away from the traditional focus on party systems, the demographic characteristics of voters, or processes of political socialization, I consider instead how events shape political consciousness. Specifically, I focus on how the experience of warfare – arguably one of the most powerful events in one’s life – affected the political attitudes of sixty seven Iraq war veterans. Through in-depth interviews, I compare two groups of Iraq war veterans who were in the same branches of the military, and experienced the same war, but who came out of that experience with completely opposite political views toward war. The first group of veterans maintains strong support for the war in Iraq. In contrast, the second group of veterans stalwartly opposes the Iraq war. How can we understand these contrasting outcomes? Specifically, how does the experience of war shape political attitudes? Prior war supporters have their idealistic views of war challenged when they learn the true nature of modern warfare. On the other hand, individuals whose military experience exceeds their expectations are more likely to support the war after they return from Iraq. Nonetheless, experiencing warfare is equally salient for both groups and the lynchpin to their political activism.
1	The study of organizations and markets suffers from the underdevelopment of disconnected producers. This article emphasizes the imputed identities of sources to argue that difficult-to-categorize outputs were appealing when associated with a source high in disconnectedness. Worldwide data on recordings and mobility with detailed data on Midwest recordings provide evidence that jazz from cities high in disconnectedness was rerecorded more often by musicians over time. Moreover, recordings with difficult-to-categorize elements were more likely to be rerecorded when coming from cities high in disconnectedness, despite evidence that original music was paradoxically less likely to come from these cities.
1	"Drawing from close to four years of ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews, and video recordings, this paper analyzes how inner-city men sustain playful street corner rap ""battles"" in South Central Los Angeles. Although participants know that the battle is supposed to be a playful way of resolving perceived disrespect in group rap ""ciphers,"" some become "" more than play."" Indeed, ritual insults have the power to provoke feelings of rage, which can propel individuals into violence. To sustain the playful meanings of battles, participants who offend their opponent use different nonverbal cues to signal, "" I was just playing,"" while the offended party responds with cues signaling, "" I do not have any hard feelings."" When these moves do not work, onlookers step in between participants, tell jokes, and use other gestures to defuse escalating tensions. The techniques outlined in this article elaborate Erving Goffman's (1974) theories of "" keys"" and "" limits,"" showing how embodied and emotional cues are used to sustain the shared presumption that "" this is play."""
1	Analyzing data from the 2007 Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan Inequality Survey, I identify and compare the determinants of economic justice attitudes in two formerly similar majority-Muslim nations that are now distinguished almost exclusively by their dissimilar economic circumstances following the collapse of the Soviet Union, In Kazakhstan, where the economy is growing rapidly, the important factors predicting economic egalitarianism are connected to people's perceived ability to do well in the future. In contrast, in Kyrgyzstan, which has stagnated in the post-Soviet era, people's immediate economic vulnerability predicts egalitarianism, while their economic prospects are irrelevant. Finally, the effect of several factors on support for egalitarianism appears impervious to the prevailing economic winds: religious orthodoxy, the urban vs. rural divide, and membership in a historically privileged ethnic group. These patterns reflect both the commonalities in the two countries' histories, demography, and religion and their divergent economic trajectories since the collapse of the USSR.
0	Although some of the most provocative sociological thinking about risks is associated with Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, past assessments have judged the more nuanced views of authors such as James Short and Kai Erikson as being sociologically superior, both as theory and as guides to empirical interpretations.  The key difference is that, while Giddens and Beck see the risks of “The Risk Society” as transcending all social boundaries, the world we inhabit is one of what we have called Titanic Risks.  As was the case for the ill-fated ocean liner, the entire ship sank. However, risks were strongly related to victims’ positions in society and in space.  Past assessments have focused on highly specialized, “advanced” technologies, such as those involving nuclear materials; the question is whether similar conclusions emerge from analyzing older or more basic technologies.  To answer that question, we turn to what may be the most fundamental of all human resource needs — water.
1	Drawing on three years of participant observation in a Liberian immigrant community, this article examines the role of legal refugee status in immigrants' daily encounters with the state. Using the literature on immigrant incorporation, claims making, and citizenship, it argues that refugee status profoundly shapes individuals' views and expectations of their host government as well as their interactions with the medical, educational, and social service institutions they encounter. The refugees in this study use their refugee status to make claims for legal and social citizenship and to distance themselves from native-born blacks. In doing so, they validate their own position vis-a-vis the state and in the American ethno-racial hierarchy. The findings presented demonstrate how refugee status operates as a symbolic and interpretive resource used to negotiate the structural realities of the welfare state and American race relations. These results stress the importance of studying immigrant incorporation from a micro perspective and suggest mechanisms for the adaptational advantages for refugees reported in existing research.
0	In the 1950s, the lives of men and women were divided into the separate spheres of work and family, so that women needed to be married and have children more than men did.  With the rise in womens paid employment, the differential importance of family roles for men and women has become much less clear, especially given the general decline in the centrality of family roles. Comparing the responses of men and women, this paper examines attitudes about the importance of marriage and parenthood for men and women.  Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households (1992-94), we show that according to these respondents, women 'need' children more than men do and men 'need' marriage more than women do.  However, answers are surprisingly egalitarian, particularly for men, who are more likely than women to think that marriage and children are necessary for both men and women.  But many men and women also think such family roles are totally unnecessary for a fully satisfying life.
1	Using ethnographic and interview data, this article explores how labor market transformations affect gender norms and family life in a rural community that has historically been tied to a single industry. It argues that the gender strategies pursued by couples heavily impact their relationships and families. Flexibility with regard to gender norms is key to creating stable relationships in a context of labor market change that threatens the existing gender order. For couples that are tied rigidly to traditional breadwinner/homemaker gender roles, men's inabilities to be the sole providers create marital and family tensions. On the other hand, couples in which men are able to refocus their conceptions of masculinity on more attainable goals such as active parenting experience less strife and more satisfaction. The research finds that rural men are more flexible with regard to masculine identity than found by previous scholars, particularly with regard to conceptions of fatherhood. The article explores in depth the processes and discourses that facilitate flexible gender identities in this conservative rural community.
0	There is now a prodigious body of scholarship in the field of lesbian and gay social history that has been written over the past 30 years. This scholarship provides rich descriptions of a wide variety of landscapes of same-sex desire, practices, associations, organizations, and politics.  This essay calls particular attention to one aspect of these diverse landscapes – the erotics of gender and the complexities of gender identification among homosexual men – and argues that, in many of these histories, this diversity is smoothed over or left behind in the narrative frame of ‘the making of a gay community’ defined on the basis of object choice. These histories “accomplish” this shift from gender identity to object choice by turning their analytical attention away from sexual subcultures where much of the gendered nature of sexual subjectivity resides to ‘gay communities’ that displace, police, or avoid gender to focus on the organizing for social change in the name of object choice.  In the paper, I argue that many of these histories take what is happening in the culture – the dominance of the hetero/homo binary as the organizing principle of many social institutions – and impose it on the lived experience of men with same-sex desire.  As a way to restore gender identity and the erotics of gender to the study of the history of sexuality, I propose the use of a queer-inflected ethnographic practice to interrogate the nature of sexual subjectivity, sexual subcultures and sexual communities.

In fact, dating has been replaced by hooking up as the dominant script for heterosexual interaction on campus.  Although recent studies have documented the phenomenon of hooking up, this behavior was likely in place long before it was recognized in the literature.  I will explore:  a) when traditional dating declined on the college campus b) the differences between the traditional dating script and and the hooking up script c) the effect of this shift on the literature and d) considerations for future research."
1	This study investigates whether the mechanisms why education is rewarded vary across countries. Do educational institutions affect the likelihood that support for a particular mechanism is found? Combining IALS survey data and OECD statistics on educational institutions, it was shown that the effect of measured skill on earnings - controlled for educational attainment - is lower in countries where educational institutions produce skills relevant for work through the vocational system. This indicates that the human capital perspective on education works particularly well in vocationally oriented educational systems, as the skills generated in education are strongly overlapping with the skills that are rewarded. An alternative mechanism sees education as a means for social closure through credentialization. Under the credentialization model, education is not primarily rewarded for the productivity-enhancing skills it entails, but rather for reasons unrelated to productivity. Following this theory education is used for selection into the organization, after which directly observable skills are determining wages. Assuming that a strongly differentiated educational system creates boundaries between social groups, it is hypothesized that strongly differentiated systems lead to stronger measured skill effects. We do not find support for this hypothesis. 
0	In characterizing contemporary society, several prominent sociological theorists have referred to the notion of the end of nature or the post-natural condition. That is, a state of existence in which the formerly untouched natural world has increasingly become the product of human decisions to intervene in nature. The analysis developed here uses the case of  the largest outbreak of a food and waterborne pathogen in Canadian history as an empirical referent to investigate how disease emergence may be understood as an unintended outcome of the post-natural condition. In so doing, this paper identifies and analyzes how naturally occurring processes existing within the environment and living organisms are altered through human practices associated with intensified livestock operations, the production of acid rain as well as by broader socio-political forces.  In responding to the call of environmental sociologists to incorporate the forces of nature into sociological analysis, the analysis draws upon insights from: disease ecology, Marxs work on the metabolic rift and the sociology of time to investigate the post-natural condition and its relationship to development of virulent diseases in contemporary society.  In particular, it was found that in conforming to the capitalist-inspired drive to compress time through changes in cattle diet and subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics, as well as environmental changes due to acid rain, the post-natural conditions became established for the emergence of new diseases.  Furthermore, this emergence was found to remain relatively hidden because of: the decontextualized character of industrial time; the separation of rural and urban life; and the separation of food production from preparation and consumption.
0	The proposed research combines an intersectional framework (focusing on the intersection of gender, race/ethnicity, and science achievement) with a geographic approach to the distribution of science resources and achievement. Data for the proposed research come from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP/2009/ 4th, 8th,  and 12th grade) and Common Core (CCD/2009). GIS (Geographic Information Systems) methodology (both mapping and statistics) will be used to answer the research questions. GIS software allows the creation of map (and statistics) which will examine geographic patterns (at regional, state, and school district levels) associated with gender and race/ethnic variation in U.S. science achievement outcomes. The proposed research is supported by growing evidence that understanding gender and race/ethnic inequity in science requires a consideration of place. A major thesis of the proposed research is that disadvantage in science is spatially located and a geographic perspective will contribute insights and solutions for resolving this inequity .
0	White studies acknowledge that for the most part, whiteness has been invisible since it has gone unmarked, assumed, and considered normative.  Whites are able to treat race and race relations as apolitical and still navigate society successfully.   However, due to the history of the South as a region with pronounced racial conflict and integration between opposing groups (blacks and whites), Southern whites may have more race consciousness about being white than whites in other regions of the United States.  To address this question, I conducted forty-two semi-structured, in-depth interviews with rural, Southern whites in Mississippi. The data for this analysis are drawn from questions about what it means to be white, what it means to be a white Southerner, and what it means to be white in local communities.  For some, being white is taken for granted while for others it is recognized as a status of at least past, if not current privilege and prejudice.  In fact, whites can hold both positions. This complex understanding of whiteness is in contrast to generalizations about white attitudes, because many of the respondents do admit that they and/or other whites have benefited from past and current segregation and discrimination.   However, the broader the context (being white in general vs. being white in the South vs. being white in their communities) the more likely the respondents were to acknowledge advantages of being white, while they were more likely to deny having white privilege the more specific the context.
0	Social disorganization theories and their systemic reformulations provide some of the most compelling and enduring explanations for the formation of gangs and associated gang behaviors. Generally, gangs are viewed as products of social dislocations associated with urban life, including poverty, social immobility, ethnic conflict, and economic isolation. Unfortunately, as applied to gangs, social disorganization theories have remained empirically untestedless because of theoretical rigor and more because of the lack of sound data. The present study seeks to rectify this shortcoming by combining neighborhood level survey data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods with detailed homicide records to test some of the central hypotheses concerning the influence of neighborhood level processes on gang behaviors, in this case homicide. Analyses are conducted disaggregated by gang homicide versus non-gang homicide at the neighborhood level. Consistent with previous findings, the structural effects of social disorganization theories are mediated by collective efficacy. Disaggregating by gang motivation, however, reveal differences between gang and non-gang homicides with respect to the association between immigrant concentration and violent behavior.
1	Using data from the 2002 National Survey of the Changing Workforce, this article examines the effects of schedule control and job autonomy on two forms of work-home role blurring: receiving work-related contact outside of normal work hours and bringing work home. Schedule control is associated positively with the frequency of receiving contact and bringing work home, although those effects are stronger among men. Job autonomy is associated positively with contact among men only, but it is associated positively with bringing work home among both women and men. Schedule control and job autonomy also modify the association between these forms of role blurring and work-to-home conflict: (1) contact is associated positively with work-to-home conflict among individuals with low job autonomy; and (2) bringing work home is associated positively with work-to-home conflict among individuals with greater schedule control. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings for the linkages among gender, work conditions associated with control, and the work-home interface. Keywords: work-home balance, schedule control, job autonomy, flexibility, work-family interface.
1	For decades sociologists, criminologists, political scientists and socio-legal scholars alike have focused on the symbolic and instrumental dimensions of law in examinations of the effects Of social reform and policy implementation. Following in this tradition, we focus on the relationship between hate crime policy and hate crime reporting to identify the conditions under which a symbolic law is accompanied by instrumental effects at the initial phase of the law enforcement process - the official recording of a hate crime event. Using data on California police and sheriff's agencies we estimate hierarchical Poisson models to determine how agency-level enforcement efforts, chiefly the creation of a formal policy on hate crime, affect official hate crime reporting. We also examine how community and agency attributes influence the effects of policy on the reporting of hate crime. We find that agency characteristics, in this case measures of the integration of the local agency within the community, shape the degree to which agency policies affect the official reporting of hate crime. Our findings reveal that while symbolic law is not intrinsically incapable of producing changes in enforcement patterns, such effects are contingent upon agency and community processes. Thus, we conclude by conceptualizing the varied enforcement contexts within which a body of symbolic law is rendered instrumental.
1	We draw upon social disorganization theory to examine the effects of community characteristics on the distribution of offsite alcohol outlets in San Diego County, California. Of particular interest is whether alcohol availability varies according to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition once measures of social disorganization (socioeconomic disadvantage, residential instability, and racial/ethnic heterogeneity) are controlled. Using data from the 1990 Census and 1993 alcohol license reports, we estimate a series of negative binomial regression models with corrections for spatial autocorrelation. The results show that percent Asian is associated with lower offsite alcohol outlet density. Once socioeconomic disadvantage is controlled, percent Latino is related to lower alcohol availability. Although similar suppressor patterns are observed, percent Black is generally unrelated to outlet density. Consistent with social disorganization theory, socioeconomic disadvantage and residential instability predict increased alcohol availability. Neighborhood racial/ethnic composition is either unrelated or inversely related to outlet density once social disorganization and other neighborhood characteristics are taken into account. 
1	This article challenges the conventional dichotomy between the civic-Western and ethnic.-Eastern forms of national attachments and empirically explores the link between national feelings and anti-immigrant sentiment, as expressed by European publics. We use data from the 1995 and 2003 ISSP modules to: (1) expose the multidimensional nature of national feelings, and (2) investigate the cross-country variation in mean levels and inter-regional heterogeneity in the severity of effects on anti-immigrant sentiment for four dimensions of national feelings. The results show that there are important regional differences in the mean levels and effects exerted by the civic and ethnic national feelings at both points in time. Overall, these findings point to the limited relevance of the conceptual demarcation between the Western-civic and Eastern-ethnic types, as a trend of cross-regional convergence is rather strongly supported. We discuss the implications of the results within the broader context of post-communist transition and eastward enlargement of the European Union. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	This article demonstrates that the Cultural Revolution led to a temporary decline in educational homogamy in urban China, which was reversed when the Cultural Revolution ended. Previous studies on educational homogamy in China have paid incomplete attention to China's shifting institutional structures. This research applies institutional theory to the trend of educational homogamy in urban China. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) state policies lowered educational legitimacy, educational homogeneity and mating opportunities in school in the urban marriage market while enhancing them before and after. From the institutional perspective I hypothesize that the strength of educational homogamy in urban China during the Cultural Revolution was weaker than before and after. I use log-multiplicative layer effect models to analyze data representative of urban residents in 20 cities. I find moderate but significant evidence for the institutional hypotheses. Educational assortative mating is subject to political intervention in urban China.
1	This article examines the issue of state compliance with universal human rights norms, focusing on a social constructivist model suggested by Thomas Risse, Stephen Ropp, and Kathryn Sikkink (1999). This spiral model outlines five stages of socialization in which different forces work together to bring a change in the policies of repressive governments. I argue that the model suffers from three major theoretical shortcomings. It (1) is over-deterministic and idealistic in its proposition that once progress toward human rights compliance has started there is no turning back; (2) treats a country's human rights practices as a homogenous block and does not leave room for disaggregation of different practices; and (3) fails to sufficiently account for the role of serious conflicts and security threats in shaping state's repressive policies. Nevertheless, drawing largely on the Israeli case I show that the spiral model should not be discarded. When substantially modified and complemented with other sociological and international relations approaches, the model remains useful for understanding the processes of change in specific violations.
1	"Using a unique data set of 3-generation education information, in this article we extend the analysis of Greenhalgh [Greenhalgh, Susan, 1985. Sexual Stratification: The other side of 'growth with equity' in East Asia. Population and Development Review 11, 265-314] and study the question of intergenerational transmission of sex-specific differential treatments. The rich data are obtained from Taiwan's Panel Study of Family Dynamics project. As far as the macro pattern is concerned, we found that although there is a clear tendency of differential treatment against females in the old generation, this tendency is significantly weakened and nearly vanishes in the young generation. Furthermore, the supporting effect of senior siblings in the old generation becomes a crowding (resource-dilution) effect in the young generation. However, within each micro lineage, there is a mild ""habitus"" effect in the sense that parents who experienced gender-specific differential treatment tend to treat their children in a similar fashion. We find that parents' education contributes to the elimination of sex-based differential treatment, consistent with the finding in Thronton et al."
0	Despite numerous expert warnings compelling humanity to reconsider their productive arrangements with nature, a unified effort to address human-ecological destruction has yet to occur.  Although both environmental sociology and political economy of the environment have furthered our understanding of the interaction between human society and the biophysical environment, these approaches fall short insofar as they are confined to static and traditional theoretical frameworks.  In place of these shortcomings, the concepts of alienation and reification are used to question the relationship between human transformation of the biophysical environment through labor on the one hand and the social conception and perception of “nature” on the other.  The following paper argues for a “critical environmental sociology” that recognizes modern capitalism as a form of social organization operating in and through not only humans but the biophysical environment as well.  This theoretical framework conceptualizes both objective drivers of human-ecological transformation and emergent forms of subjectivity as synchronous with the historical development of the commodity form.  Theoretical implications and areas for future research are discussed throughout.
1	Although interest in religion among young people has increased markedly, research examining the impact of religion on child development has been sorely lacking. This study is the first of its kind to use nationally representative data to explore the influence of religion on several different dimensions of psychological development and social adjustment in early childhood. Data from the Spring 2000 wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) are analyzed to explore how child development is shaped by individual parents' religiosity, the religious homogamy of couples, and the family's religious environment. Significant religious effects are observed across a range of child development domains and are manifested for both parents' ratings and teachers' ratings of youngsters. Parental, couple, and familial religion are linked with youngsters' pro-social behavior. However, religion can undermine child development when it is a source of conflict among families. The investigation concludes with a specification of implications and directions for future research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	Research examining the influence of social relationships on child outcomes has demonstrated that children social capital from more than one context, and that capital created both in families and schools can benefit academic attainment. What is less clear, however, is whether students from different status groups build social capital in different ways and receive different returns to that social capital. We address this deficit by comparing the creation of and returns to social capital for three groups: boys and girls, advantaged and disadvantaged students, and white and nonwhites. We hypothesize that students in historically-advantaged groups will receive greater returns to both their family and school social capital. Using a large national dataset and multi-group analyses in structural equation modeling, we find that while there are small differences in the importance of particular factors in building social capital for each of these group, there are more pronouced differences in terms of return to social capital. Family social capital has a stronger effect on academic achievement for boys, students from higher SES families, and whites, while boys and higher SES students also gain more from school social capital.
0	The determinants of adolescent romantic relationships and sexual behavior have always been a central topic in social science research. However, due to the pervasiveness of internet use among youth and its central importance to their social behaviors, analyses that examine only traditional determinants, such as family and academic characteristics, are no longer satisfactory. In this study, we present a quantitative analysis of the influences of internet use and internet café visits on the timing of adolescents’ first romantic relationship and first sexual intercourse using longitudinal data from Taiwan that followed more than 5,000 adolescents from junior high school to their early twenties from 2000 to 2009. Survival analyses clearly indicate that, in any given age in adolescence, internet use and internet café visits both increase the hazard of first romantic relationship and first sexual intercourse, net of family bonds, parental supervision, and other commonly-controlled sociodemographic and educational variables. In particular, adolescent girls who visit internet cafés are more vulnerable than their female counterparts who do not visit internet cafés and than boys in general. Multinomial logit analyses further show that internet use and internet café visits increase the likelihood of having sexual intercourse before first romantic relationship. These results add to the growing literature on the influence of new media on adolescent development, and specifically, romantic and sexual behavior.
1	Drawing on previous theoretical and empirical work, we posit that maternal employment influences on child well-being vary across birth cohorts. We investigate this possibility by analyzing longitudinal data from a sample of children and their mothers drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We introduce a series of age, cohort, and maternal employment interaction terms into multilevel models predicting child well-being to assess whether any potential short-term or long-term effects of early and current maternal employment vary across birth cohorts. Results indicate that maternal employment largely is inconsequential to child well-being regardless of birth cohort, with a few exceptions. For instance, children born in earlier cohorts may have experienced long-term positive effects of having an employed mother; however, as maternal employment became more commonplace in recent cohorts, these beneficial effects appear to have disappeared. We discuss theoretical and methodological implications of these findings. 
1	"Building on Preston and Campbell's two-sex model of intergenerational transmission, this article provides a theoretical analysis of the dynamics of the racial distribution in black-white-mulatto systems. The author shows that ""bounded"" patterns of racial classification and switching imply long-run racial homogeneity in the absence of differential reproduction. Beyond the theoretical analysis, the author attempts to account for the dramatic growth of the white population share in Puerto Rico in the early 20th century. Because the effects of racial classification and differential reproduction were roughly offsetting, the observed growth of the white share can be attributed almost entirely to racial switching."
1	Assimilation theorists have long viewed inter-group romantic partnerships as indicators of racial equality. Although the past half-century has witnessed the erosion of anti-miscegenation laws and subsequent increases in the frequency of interracial marriages, these unions remain relatively infrequent. Low intermarriage rates may be partially explained by the informal sanctions leveled at young interracial romances. This study tests whether adolescents who interracially date arc at greater risks of peer difficulties than intra-racially dating youth. Results demonstrate a positive relationship between adolescent interracial dating and peer trouble at school. As hypothcsized from ethnographic research and theories of inter-group relations, results suggest that interracial romances activate peer sanctions and that these reactions are strongest when romances involve black students.

0	Racial inequality within the juvenile justice system has been determined and documented by numerous studies (Bishop 2005; Engen, Steen & Bridges 2002; Leiber et.al. 2007:471; Pope, Lovell, and Hsia 2002).  This inequality is generally referred to as disproportionate minority contact (DMC), and the causes have been debated in the literature for decades.  Using a relatively unique methodology for DMC literature, this study incorporated in-depth interview data from thirty male juveniles residing in a private correctional facility.  This data was used to understand the causes of disproportionate minority contact.  By analyzing and comparing the experiences of incarcerated juveniles, support for theories of systemic racism, Donald Black’s self-help theory, and Agnew’s general strain theory was found.  Major findings show minority participants described anger and revenge as the most common reasons for committing crimes compared to whites, who cited boredom as their primary reason for engaging in criminal activity.  Furthermore, black, Latino, and Native American respondents were more likely to report growing up in dangerous neighborhoods than whites.  Police interactions also showed a racial discrepancy, with whites receiving more chances from the police, and minorities being repeatedly arrested by the same officer slightly more than whites.  Overall, findings suggest that disproportionate minority contact is a result of disproportionate levels of strain and injustice experienced by minorities compared to whites. Additional analysis of the findings is expected to elucidate further explanations for disproportionate minority contact.
0	The relationship between religion and the family represents the intersection of two major social institutions.  Despite prior literature focusing on the effects of religiosity on cohabitation or childbearing in cohabiting relationships, the intersection of race and religion has been neglected.  Preliminary results confirm past research findings that blacks are less likely to form unions and are less likely to marry, and that religion increases the chances of union formation and decrease the odds of choosing a cohabiting union for whites.  However, the preliminary results also suggest that religiosity does impact the union formation and union choice differently according to race.
1	Analyzing three waves of data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey, this article explores the process of language assimilation among second-generation Latinos Although previous studies have focused on the shift from mother tongue to English across immigrant generations, few have examined change in language proficiency over time within the second generation Results from a series of growth-curve models suggest three findings First, both English and Spanish proficiency increased over time Second, significant differences exist across Latino ethnic groups, with Mexicans being least proficient in English and most proficient in Spanish Third, use of Spanish at home and in school has no effect on English acquisition, but significantly promotes Spanish retention Overall, these findings lend support for the emergence of a new context for bilingualism
1	Why are some nations more religious than others? This article proposes a multilevel framework in which country differences in religious attendance are explained by contextual, individual, and cross-level interaction effects. Hypotheses from different theories are simultaneously tested with data from 60 nations obtained from the European/World Values Surveys. Multilevel logistic regression analyses show that religious regulation in a country diminishes religious attendance and that there are only small negative effects of people's own education and average educational level of the country. Religious attendance is strongly affected by personal and societal insecurities and by parental and national religious socialization and level of urbanization. These theories explain 75% of the cross-national variation in religious attendance.
0	This quantitative analysis of the context of student decision-making in college pathways reveals that while parental education and family income constrain college pathways, student achievement plays a large role in eventual degree completion. Thus todays students appear to be pushed into jumping towards different trajectories, both initiating and responding to structural influences.
1	Polish farmers became politically contentious after democratization in 1989, despite their minimal involvement in the Solidarity movement. I test the effectiveness of social movement theories in explaining this phenomenon by examining frequency and intensity of protest from 1980-1995. I find that grievance models have little explanatory power, political opportunity accounts for the frequency of protest, and resource mobilization offers insight into both frequency and intensity of protests. Supplementing existing theories, I offer qualitative evidence that development programs designed to restructure agricultural cooperatives created mobilizing structures. The reforms were intended to help family farmers adapt to the new market economy, but because most protests targeted liberalization policies, I conclude that in their short-term success, development agencies inadvertently subsidized the cost of collection action against their long-term goals.
1	"We replicate and extend John Shelton Reed's classic work on regional identification by examining and modeling the prevalence of the words ""Dixie"" and ""Southern"" in business names across 100 cities and four decades. We find that the instances of ""Dixie"" have dropped precipitously, although identification with the word ""Southern"" has remained more constant, providing evidence of a trend we term re-southernization. We also find that the relative number of blacks in the population provides the most consistent explanation of regional identity. Population density has also emerged as a significant predictor of regional identification in more recent time periods. These findings contribute to the literature on regional identification, the politics of naming and the sociology of the South."
1	Are people quick to adopt status beliefs about a social difference that lead them to treat others unequally? In a test of status construction theory, two experiments show that men and women form equally strong status beliefs from only two encounters with others. Men act powerfully on these new beliefs in their next encounters with others but women do not, possibly because women Ace greater social risks for acting oil ambiguous status advantages. Women are just as likely as men, however, to treat someone unequally on the basis of an established status distinction. This suggests that men are first movers in the emergence of status distinctions, but women eventually adopt the distinctions as well. Our results show that people readily transform social differences into status distinctions-distinctions that act as formidable forces of inequality.
1	We assess the intergenerational educational mobility of recent cohorts of high school graduates to consider whether Hispanics' lagging post-secondary attainment reflects a temporary lull due to immigration of low education parents or a more enduring pattern of unequal transmission of social status relative to whites. Using data from three national longitudinal studies, a recent longitudinal study of Texas high school seniors and a sample of students attending elite institutions, we track post-secondary enrollment and degree attainment patterns at institutions of-differing selectivity. We find that group differences in parental education and nativity only partly explain the Hispanic-white gap in college enrollment, and not evenly over time. Both foreign- and native-born college-educated Hispanic parents are handicapped in their abilities to transmit their educational advantages to their children compared with white parents. We conclude that both changing population composition and unequal ability to confer status advantages to offspring are responsible for the growing Hispanic-white degree attainment gap.
0	"In this paper, I take up the question of whether and how welfare states are involved in the gendered organization of sexuality. I rely on Connell's conceptualization of states as a set of processes (e.g., the process of regulation) rather than a monolithic structure expressed in formal policies, and his conceptualization of gender relations as constituted by practices (even as the social structure of gender constrains practices) to frame my analysis of U.S. child support enforcement for welfare-reliant unmarried mothers.  I find that child support workers' and attorneys' practices contribute to the shifting cultural meanings of the gendered category ""nice girl.""  Moreover, the shifting meanings of ""nice girl"" sexualize women's ""dependency"" on the welfare state, deepen and reinforce the ways in which ""dependency"" is both individualized and gendered, and thus set the terms by which new forms of state regulation of poor unmarried mothers are justified."
1	Although a growing number of American parents work non-standard schedules, evidence on the consequences of such working patterns is inconsistent and limited to married samples. This study highlights the importance of considering potential differences between cohabiting and married parents in terms of the relationship between non-standard work schedules and parental well-being. Based on pooled data from the 1997 and 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce (n = 2346), we find that in contrast to married parents who experience some positive associations of non-standard schedules and parental well-being, cohabiting parents are more likely to experience a negative relationship between non-standard work schedules and parental well-being. Additionally, for cohabiting parents (but not married), non-standard work schedules are related to increased work-family conflict, which is in turn associated with lower levels of parental well-being. 
1	Sociologists long have observed that the urban poor rely on kinship networks to survive economic destitution. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among evicted tenants in high-poverty neighborhoods, this article presents a new explanation for urban survival, one that emphasizes the importance of disposable ties formed between strangers. To meet their most pressing needs, evicted families often relied more on new acquaintances than on kin. Disposable ties facilitated the flow of various resources, but often bonds were brittle and fleeting. The strategy of forming, using, and burning disposable ties allowed families caught in desperate situations to make it from one day to the next, but it also bred instability and fostered misgivings among peers.
0	This paper studies the battle for the new labor contract law between the post-socialist party-state and the transnational corporations at the turn of the 21st century. Human rights advocates usually focus on the post-socialist party-state, pointing out all sorts of human right violations it committed in China. On the other hand, globalization is often promoted by its corporate sponsors as a way to improve rights and standards. However, during the battle for labor rights in China, their role is reversed: The Chinese socialist party-state were seen as actively promoting the expansion of labor rights, while the transnationals came out in blocking and cutting back of labor rights in China. The paper will examine the historical process of the formulation, revision, and the implementation of new labor law in China at the turn of the 21st century. It will discuss how the lobby of the business community had resulted in a much weakened version of labor law which considerably scales back protections for workers. In the end, the paper will discuss the implications of the new labor law for China's development.
0	Using three waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this paper examines the role of adolescent romantic relationship experiences on young adult relationship and family formation. We examine adolescent relationships by their duration, intensity, and quality and cohabitation and marriage (in combination and separately) in early adulthood. Additional planned analyses will consider adolescent relationship precursors to non-marital pregnancy and child-bearing, and test for different associations by race/ethnic group membership. Preliminary results suggests that adolescent relationship experiences are related to whether individuals have formed a residential union by wave 3 in young adulthood (ages 18-25), however adolescent experiences do little to distinguish the type of residential union (cohabitation v. marriage).
1	What role do the media play in the identification and construction of white-collar crimes? Few studies have examined media coverage of corporate deviance This study investigates news coverage of six large-scale accounting scandals that broke in 2001 and 2002. Using a variety of empirical methods to analyze the 51 largest U.S. newspapers, the study tests several explanations for tendencies to run more or less coverage of the scandals in question. The study then examines the substantive focus of coverage. First, the results suggest that scandal coverage was influenced by the political ideology of newspapers, as opposed to economic interests or social structural tics between firms. Second, the analysis shows that attention to the adjudication of individual crimes and the punishment of individual offenders received the bulk of media attention.
1	We investigate the social and behavioral characteristics Of male adolescents who self-identify as players, focusing particularly on Anderson claim that this social role is inextricably linked with poverty and minority status. Results indicate that black respondents, those affiliated with liberal peers and young men who initially report a relatively high number of sexual partners are more likely to resonate with this identity label. Nevertheless, analyses reveal that a number of players within the sample are not disadvantaged black youth, and there is considerable variability in their attitude and behavior profiles. Findings based on longitudinal analyses indicate that the player identity is a significant predictor of later variations in self-reported sexual behavior, net of traditional predictors, including prior behavior. Yet results of in-depth interviews conducted with a subset of the respondents complicate these quantitative findings, highlighting that young mend perceptions of this identity are not as uniformly positive as Anderson depiction might lead us to expect.
0	"What kinds of people are apt to experience status anxieties in upscale stores? What makes them feel this way? And what are the consequences? To find out, research participants were sent to high-end and regular stores to report on their visits. Mostly those who experienced status anxiety and reported ""snooty"" or derogatory encounters went to high-end stores. The data shows that participants’ status self-assessments relative to others heightened their attunement to status and status-relevant cues, but mostly when they perceived their status as lower and when they accepted the setting’s values. Heightened attunement to status, in turn, made participations uncomfortable and prone to experiencing others’ behaviors as snubs. The findings suggest that peoples’ structural positions – via status assessments – influence their experiences in high-end stores and condition the way they respond to status insults – whether they are impervious to them or whether they respond with cool anger or hurt, resentment, and avoidance. This study echoes earlier studies that find lower classes tend to self-exclude from venues such as art museums, opera, and elite education. It also sheds light on mechanisms that prompt cognitive and physical boundary-work."
1	Research has confirmed a motherhood penalty and fatherhood bonus at work. Employers, it appears, regard mothers and fathers differently from one another and differently from non-parents. We have yet to systematically explore whether mothers exhibit fewer pro-work behaviors than fathers and non-parents or whether fathers engage in more of them than mothers and non-parents. This article draws on nationally representative data from full-time employed adults to investigate mother, father, and non-parent differences in work effort, work intensity, job engagement, and four measures of work enhancement from home. Mothers and fathers are similar on five out of seven outcomes tapping pro-work dimensions. When they differ, mothers report greater job engagement and work intensity than fathers. Mothers are no different from non-parents on all outcomes. All findings hold net of individual, job, and family controls. I conclude that reducing workplace gender inequality will require organizational changes that pay explicit attention to workers' care-giving responsibilities. 
0	Past research on pro-environmental behaviors has generally reported the “gender gap,” whereby women are more likely to engage in such activities.  This research aims to understand this gender gap in the social context of household division of labor.  The data used for the analyses come from the 2002 Japanese General Social Survey, national representative data that survey 2,953 men and women from the ages of 20 to 89.  Analyses revealed that the differences of gender in participating in waste management and water conservation are explained by the fact that these activities are carried out as a part of domestic work, of which women carry the lion’s share.  For other pro-environmental activities, such as opting for organic food or buying recycled products, participation in domestic work explained approximately 30% to 50% of the gender effect.  After taking into account that domestic work is mainly carried out by women, the direct effect of gender still remained; women are more likely to take part in pro-environmental behaviors on a day-to-day basis.  Implication for green consumerism and gender gap in unpaid work are discussed.
0	For Durkheim, the sacred was that which was separate from the everyday experiences of the mundane world.  Neo-Durkheimian scholarship has drawn on this insight to understand the narratives and codes that make up the civil sphere.  In this version of events, sacred meanings are ritualized in a civil religion that drives the practices of citizens.  Here I return to some of Durkheim’s positions to argue that a better understanding would be one that posited a less than complete separation between the sacred and mundane.  Drawing on Foucault and contemporary anthropology, I argue that everyday encounters with the sacred are constitutive of the sacred itself.  In the mundane or everyday realms of our lives we are exposed to and come to accept or reject discourses and practices regarding the sacred. Everyday sites are not just spaces of (self-) management, but also spaces integral for the creation and reproduction of sacred codes.  I explore this dynamic in the context of citizenship.   I argue that the sacred of a society, including citizenship, is not solely something learned through top-down forms of power.  Rather, societies reproduce their sacred values by intertwining them into the daily lives of individuals.
1	Despite the close political regulation of union recognition disputes, sociologists have paid little attention to recent political determinants of success in these contests. A state-centered political-opportunity approach suggests that if conservative political officials can reduce the number of union recognition elections, union organization will be blocked. Partly because man labor scholars claim there was a postwar departure in labor movement fortunes, we attempt to detect and model a contingent break in the relationship between Republican control of the presidency and these elections using interactive specifications. Our findings show that shortly after the conservative, anti-union Reagan administration took office, recognition elections, and union victories in these elections, fell sharply. With macroeconomic and other determinants held constant, other political conditions with explanatory power include congressional oversight committee ideology and conservative appointments to the key regulatory agency. Our findings support political accounts and also suggest that unions' failures to organize new workplaces were sustained by subsequent conservative administrations.
0	Based on a recent nationally representative sample of 2,030 children aged 2-17, this paper examines the cumulative prevalence of victimization and its impact on mental health.  Telephone interviews conducted with both caregivers and youth revealed socio-demographic variations in lifetime exposure to most forms of victimization, with older children, ethnic minorities, those lower in socio-economic status, and those living in single-parent or stepfamilies experiencing greater victimization.  Multivariate analyses indicated significant independent effects of each form of victimization considered (sexual assault, child maltreatment, witnessing family violence, and other major violence exposure) on levels of both depression and anger/aggression, with socio-demographic factors and the other victimization types controlled.  Moreover, while lifetime exposure to non-victimization adversity also showed substantial independent effects when added to the models, in most cases, each victimization domain remained a significant predictor of mental health.   Results suggest that cumulative exposure to multiple forms of victimization over a child?s life-course represents a substantial source of mental health risk.
0	This paper will address the issue of fatalism from a sociological perspective and ask the question, is there such a thing as Islamic fatalism? Fatalism may stem, as Durkheim argued, from structural conditions such as inequality or extreme over regulation leading to what I have called structural fatalism. However, fatalism may also, as Weber argued, result from distinct belief systems that socialize adherents to accept specific beliefs that higher powers control lifes outcomes; a condition that I have previously called cosmological fatalism. Survey data from four primarily Islamic countries will be used to assess the classic theorists distinct formulations of fatalism. Drawing from literature from the so-called Clash of Civilizations debates, results of regression analysis here suggest a standard misinterpretation of Islamic fatalism but one that is best explained by accounting for the multifaceted nature of the fatalism concept. Respondents in Muslim countries show moderate levels of structural fatalism that resemble that of Eastern Europeans and generally feel a sense of mastery over lifes affairs. Findings are mixed regarding differences between Middle Eastern Christians and Muslims in terms of self-mastery but Muslims do indicate a higher level of belief that cosmological forces control lifes outcomes than do Middle Eastern Christians. Western influence and higher levels of modernization may actually cause Muslims to feel they have less control over their lives and that Muslims living in more Westernized countries such as Turkey tend to be much more structurally fatalist than Muslims living in less Westernized countries.

As the Earths climate begins to shift into a hotter and more unpredictable period, there is a basic injustice in who will suffer worst and first.  Nations facing rising oceans and drought are those least responsible for the problem, and they have the least resources to cope with them.  We seek here to combine the largely natural scientific literature on national vulnerability to climate change with sociological insights on inequality in the world system.  Doing so provides some insights into the deadlock currently facing the Kyoto treaty, wherein both global North and South nations both feel that the sacrifices the treaty might require are too great.  The issue is environmental justice, and to evaluate claims of injustice we examine three cases where the first signs of climate change are being felt worst and first: rising sea levels swamping entire Pacific Island atoll nations, devastating drought in Africa; and murderous flooding in Bangladesh.  In each case these nations are suffering not only because of bad geography or management.  Rather, because of their colonial past and current positions in the world-economy, they are brutally vulnerable to forces outside their control.  We conclude by discussing a paradox of globalization: As a problem which has allowed many people to see their personal fate as part of a global commons, climate change provides a deeply problematic and critical case for understanding the perils and opportunities of global consciousness and global governance.
0	Mothers experience penalties—and fathers bonuses—in job attainment, pay, promotion, and workplace evaluation.   Motherhood penalties occur partly because employers punish them for displaying work commitment which contradicts the stereotypical qualities associated with motherhood.   Fatherhood bonuses stem, in part, because fatherhood signals dependability, masculinity, and commitment to breadwinning.  Are men who engage in caregiving, a stereotypically female activity inconsistent with traits of the “ideal” masculine worker, penalized at work?  To answer this question we conducted an experiment in which roughly 500 participants evaluated a fictitious resume and cover letter for a professional job.  The experiment manipulated the applicant’s sex (male or female) and caregiver status (parent, elder caregiver, or non-caregiver).   Evaluators than rated the applicant on five dimensions: acceptable family leave taking, workplace qualification, responsibility, professionalism, and hirability.  Evaluators rated male elder caregivers significantly lower than fathers on four outcomes, lower than mothers on two outcomes, and the same as male non-caregivers on all dimensions.  Despite having lower ratings than fathers and mothers on most outcomes and similar ratings as female elder caregivers and non-caregivers of both sexes, evaluators were more likely to say they would hire the male elder caregiver.   We conclude that although men suffer from penalty for caregiving, a male advantage exists in hiring.    We discuss the implications of our findings for gender inequality at work.
1	This study examines the extent and causes of inequalities in information technology ownership and use between natives and immigrants in the United States, with particular focus on the role of English ability. The results indicate that, during the period 1997-2003, immigrants were significantly less likely to have access to or use a computer and the Internet. Moreover, the gap in IT usage widened during that period. Immigrants and natives who live in Spanish-speaking households are less likely than individuals living in English-speaking households to have access to or use IT Estimates using a measure of predicted English ability show that English ability is positively associated with IT access and use. The results suggest that much of the immigrant-native gap in IT usage is attributable to differences in English ability.
0	This essay outlines the emergence of new political opportunity structures (POS) in Mexico in its contemporary period of economic liberalization reform and political opening. The concept of opportunity has not been rigorously examined outside the context of the United States and Europe, and Mexico is a fertile case for expanding this body of work. First, qualitative data and the historical record will be utilized to define specific dimensions of opportunity as these have emerged in the reform era. Drawing on distinctions identified by Meyer (2004) and Meyer and Minkoff (2004), I restrict the focus to opportunities for protest mobilization and exclude other possible dependent measures, such as organization formation or outcomes. Their emphasis on issue-specific and general opportunity structures will also be incorporated. Second, four years of nationwide protest event data will be utilized to evaluate and further refine this operational model of opportunities in Mexico. Beyond its potential to inform the broader project of developing a more nuanced theory of political opportunities in the collective action and social movements literature, this analysis represents an essential building block for a broader study of protest dynamics in Mexico in the neoliberalization and political reform era in which I am engaged.

Disease onset typically occurs during mid-life when adults carry a heavy burden of work and family related responsibilities.  Research has recently found rehabilitation for MS patients to be an effective means to slow disease progression and improve patient functioning.  Given rehabilitations potential to impact the life course of MS patients, it is important to understand how the structure of rehabilitation programs and facilities impact MS patients identity, long-term health, well-being, quality of life, and commitment to rehabilitation programs.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the social construction of rehabilitation at two sites using observational analysis and interviews with MS patients.  Results indicate that within these programs, barriers commonly encountered by MS patients in larger society are minimized so as to help patients focus solely on rehabilitation.  Analysis of the interviews resulted in the identification of patient equality and a settings simplified focus as key themes within rehabilitation programs that lead to positive outcomes.  Patients also described the rehabilitation programs as having a family feel and noted that disability did not incite devaluation in these settings.  Patients viewed rehabilitations social component and the relationship patients have with each other as important coping mechanisms.  Commitment to rehabilitation appears to increase as a result of these factors.  This is notable considering the positive consequences that rehabilitation may have on the MS patients health, well-being, and long-term quality of life.
0	The phenomenon underlying spiritual experience is psychism, defined as perceptions of psychic intrusions into the stream of consciousness that are interpreted by the actor as not originating within the selfs normal information channels. Ethnophenomenological accounts suggest that (1) people regularly experience intrusions but ignore those inconsistent with their beliefs; (2) externalization and perception of psychic objects as real is an identity-based decision; (3) once these are accepted as real, their derived meanings are resistant to disproof or reinterpretation, even if those interpretations requires shifting social networks. Psychism represents private construction and validation of meaning  a violation of symbolic interactionist principles.
0	The Buddhist doctrine of non-self offers an intriguing conception of selfhood often contrasted with the western- modern conception of the self. Though much attention has been given to the study of this doctrine through Buddhist texts, the Buddhist negation of the self is not well captured in the scarce ethnographies that investigate Buddhist practice. By introducing an analytic standpoint to the study of the self, this paper distinguishes between three levels: the analytic concept of the self used by the researcher, the emic cultural conception of the self, and the actual experience of selfhood. Based on an ethnographic research among practitioners of Buddhist meditation (Vipassana) in Israel and the United States, this paper uses the above analytic distinctions in order to shed light on the Buddhist concept of non-self.  By using the analytic (etic) concept of the self as produced through social relations, this paper reveals how the practices of meditation and renunciation can dismantle emotional and cognitive identifications and aim to de-construct some aspects of the differentiation between the self and the other. Since this differentiation is crucial for the experience of a sense of self, Buddhist practices have a strong influence towards an experience of selfhood that can be understood as a non-self experience.
0	Conducting an ethnographic comparative study in a northeastern metropolitan area, a variety of social spaces identified as non-normative in regard to gender and sexuality are explored. With a concentration on spaces of those who identify as queer, a process of identity formation is witnessed. Negotiations of tangible and theoretical space contribute to the operationalization of queer as a category of identity. Using bound social space as a unifying factor, time was also spent in lesbian community, illuminating intricacies of queerness as both a critique and a category of identity. The meaning of the theoretical construct of queer as explained in the literature and experience of queer as an identity within community have areas of disconnect which are explored herein.  Community space was interpreted as giving power to an unrecognized experience, creating a voice of a more encompassing and liberating embodiment of gender.
0	Popular, medical, and academic discourses have framed infertility as an affliction of the white and the wealthy.  This framing is based upon hegemonic ideologies of class and motherhood that have normalized views of fertility and infertility along socioeconomic divides.  Poor, black women are consistently portrayed as highly fertile and unfit to mother, while images of infertility are enmeshed with middle- and upper-class white women. Prior research on infertility tends to exacerbate this dichotomy by focusing on the experiences of women receiving medical treatment, typically women of high socioeconomic status (SES).  Yet, both the representation and the current, limited understanding of infertility fail to recognize that, statistically, more women of color and women of low SES live with involuntary childlessness.  In this paper, I explore how poor and working-class women experience infertility when they are excluded from the norms of motherhood and unable to attain medical treatment to resolve the issue.  Through 26 in-depth interviews, I find that the women conduct identity work of distancing from negative stereotypes, expand and redefine ideologies of motherhood according to their contexts, and compensate for childlessness in various, non-medical ways in order to negotiate experiences of infertility in a context of structural inequality.
1	This article investigates how social network use to find work affects pay. Analyses using the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality consider the extent to which a network contact's influence level affects a job applicant's pay, whether this effect differs for white, black, and Latino contacts, and how workplace racial context moderates this relationship. Three main findings emerge. First, having an influential contact-one with hiring authority-compared to having no contact yields higher pay. Second, white and minority contact influence on pay differs: among minority contacts, being an outsider (i.e., someone not employed by the firm to which the applicant applies) is associated with higher pay, but being an employee of the firm-an insider-is not. Third, regardless of workplace racial context. black and Latino contacts' influence is most beneficial when their race/ethnicity is not known to the hiring agent. We offer a new interpretation of the mixed findings with regard to the relationship between social network use and pay. 
0	Since the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989-91, cultural politics in postcommunist Europe has been shaped by what Michael Kennedy (2002) calls transition culture.  According to Kennedy, the culture of transition establishes a basic conceptual framework that implements the foundational oppositions of liberal anti-communism as a blueprint for postcommunist restructuring.  Cultural politics, as I use the phrase, refers to the struggle of real political actors to define the symbolic terrain on which this restructuring will be carried out.  In this paper, I focus on symbolic geography as a key stake in the cultural politics of postcommunist transition.  My point of departure is the symbolic opposition between East and West that has pervaded much discourse about postcommunist transition.  My argument is that the symbolic geography of postcommunism exhibits certain properties of a geometric fractal or self-same structurea structure that repeats a pattern within itself (Abbott 2001, p. 9).  In the present case, the self-same structure in question consists of geographic boundary that reproduces itself as a (theoretically infinite) series of nested binaries at successively lower spatial scales.
1	How do congregations from a white ethnic denomination respond to growing urban diversity? Using an ecological perspective, we examine 14 Christian Reformed congregations in Southeast Grand Rapids, Michigan over a 30-year time period (1970 to 2000). We track neighborhood composition, residential patterns of congregation members, and congregation membership totals. As white residents declined in urban neighborhoods, congregations from this historically Dutch denomination had difficulty sustaining themselves as neighborhood churches. Tracing the history of these congregations revealed churches reaching beyond their neighborhoods for members as the surroundings changed. Such activities resulted in niche overlap, heightened competition, and jeopardized organizational sustainability. Older, more traditional churches in the most dramatically changing neighborhoods saw membership plummet. Newer, more suburban congregations showed greater stability. Fastest growing were mission churches originally formed to serve non-Dutch constituencies but now attracting diverse members from a wide area. Implementing organizational ecology theory, our conclusions address issues of adaptation, institutional interrelationships, and the contingent nature of competitive advantage.
1	Debates over immigration's impact on less advantaged native workers often ignore industrial structure for creating segregated labor markets and demand for immigrant workers. We analyze population movements of less-educated foreign-born Hispanic, native-born Hispanic. White, and Black men between 1995 and 2000 using MIGPUMA-level 2000 PUMS data. We model in-migration, out-migration, and net migration for each group controlling for demographic composition, employment structure, change in employment structure, labor market indicators, and macro contextual measures. Results indicate positive significant relationships between migration patterns of all groups and support labor demand explanations of internal low-skilled migration emphasizing industrial change rather than labor competition. 
0	Older people typically know the dangers of smoking, poor diet, obesity and high blood pressure but often lack motivation to make appropriate life style changes. Motivating and empowering older people to be active and healthy, even with support from family and community, is a challenge. Seniors in Motion (SIM), a non-profit fitness facility, was established in 2003 to implement an intervention program encompassing physical fitness, education, and family and community support. Building on the results of a pilot feasibility study conducted in 2007-2008, SIM participants were given the opportunity to sign up for a research project designed to assess individual progress and program effectiveness. Fifty-two volunteers completed both the initial assessments during September 2009 and the follow-up reassessments in March of 2010. Comparisons of muscle strength, joint flexibility, gait performance and body composition were made over the 6-month period. Of the indicators selected for review, most measuring muscle strength and flexibility showed significant improvement. Most seniors over time reported an increased in the time they devoted to several different types of exercise, activities in and related to the home, while reducing the time devoted to sedentary activities. Overall, more seniors reported a more active and less sedentary lifestyle than at the initial assessment. Beyond making people stronger and more flexible an unanticipated bonus was the spirit of kinship and community that grew out of participation. The opportunity to engage in meaningful social contact provided a most powerful antidote in the battle against health problems and their frequent companion loneliness.
1	Religious fundamentalism is conceived as a distinctive set Of beliefs and attitudes toward one's religion, including obedience to religious norms, belief in the universality and immutability of its principles, the validity of its claims, and its indispensability for human happiness. Surveys of Egyptian and Saudi youth, ages 18-25, reveal that respondents with higher levels of fundamentalism are more likely to rely on religious authorities as the source of knowledge about the sociopolitical role of Islam, support religious law, be fatalistic, and feel insecure. They are also less likely to watch TV Saudi females are more fundamentalist than males, but in Egypt, the opposite held true. Country-specific effects are present, and there are implications for future research.
1	How does the race of protesters affect how police respond to protest events? Drawing on the protest policing literature and on theories of race and ethnic relations, we explore the idea that police view African American protesters as especially threatening and that this threat leads to a greater probability of policing. We examine more than 15,000 protest events that took place in the United States between 1960 and 1990 and find that in many years, African American protest events are more likely than white protest events to draw police presence and that once at events, police are more likely to take action at African American protest events. Additional analyses complicate these findings by showing that they vary over time. In many years, for example, African American protest events are no more likely than white protest events to be policed. While there is support for a ''Protesting While Black'' phenomenon, it is not invariant across the entire period of inquiry.
0	More than 1,500 drug courts have been established nationwide since the first such court opened in 1989. Alongside the drug court movement, legal scholars and social scientists have adapted the therapeutic jurisprudence perspective developed by Winick and Wexler to identify the purposes and design elements that contribute to successful drug courts.  At the surface, therapeutic jurisprudence appears to be a practical effort to help guide drug court practice.  However, at its core, this perspective represents a radical departure in defining justice as well as the states role in achieving justice for its citizenry.  By claiming that justice is therapy, the therapeutic jurisprudence perspective reaches beyond how to design and operate a drug court into a larger question of what it means to criminalize drugs and how criminals should be treated by the justice system. One of the primary questions that needs to be explored empirically is whether and how drug court team members can integrate the demands of enforcing criminal law and treating drug addiction.  This paper uses existing research and preliminary observational data to explore how drug court team members negotiate the dual demands of the law and therapy.
0	In the last several decades, family structure has undergone considerable change, with less than half of all American adolescents residing with two married biological parents. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, we seek to introduce three improvements to the measurement of family structure in delinquency research: (1) multicategory operationalization of family structure, (2) distinction between married and cohabiting parent figures, and (3) consideration of a blended family that includes children from a previous marriage. With a more elaborate measure of family structure in hand, we find considerable heterogeneity in the risk of antisocial and delinquent behavior among groups of youths residing in what are traditionally dichotomized as intact and non-intact (or broken) families.
0	"Although ultimately concerned with how participants themselves experience the meaningful social world, interpretive sociology has neglected more local and situated ways that issues of meaning arise. That is, participants in social worlds are not preoccupied with  problems of meaning and only address them at discrete times and places in everyday life. The study draws its impetus from ethnomethodology, but the empirical part of the paper, involves conversation analysis involves clinical interactions. The analysis shows how, after a delivery of diagnostic news, participants to the delivery may engage in meaning assessment or interpreting the news. They do so through meaning assessment sequences whereby a clinician proposes what the news means and the recipient (patient or other recipient) aligns or disaligns to the proposal. Further practices of meaning assessment are ""affirming the positive"" and ""disconfirming the negative"" and work to provide relatively benign interpretations of news. Analysis of a collection of meaning assessment sequences in clinical settings is brought to bear on a single case in which an internist tells a patient that he has stomach cancer. After hearing the diagnosis, the patient ends up asking, Does it mean Im gonna die. At this point, the interview gets disrupted as the patient withdraws. This patients exhibit of difficulty is an outcome of orderly social practices. The suggestion is that meaning assessment, as an everyday activity, has organized dimensions that help produce the stability of given social scenes."

It seeks to answer two main questions.  1) What was the relative influence of ""biomedical"" and ""public health"" idea packages over time? and 2) What explains these patterns.  It finds that biomedical proposals dominated in most years, but public health approaches cut into biomedical dominance to some degree during the 1980s.  Much of the dominance of biomedical proposals after 1987 was the result of the emergence of biomedical research on the minority health policy agenda.  It offers preliminary hypotheses for explaining these patterns by drawing on interest group, legislative subsidy, movement spillover and policy legacy theories of policy-making."
1	We use panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to estimate the effects of cognitive skills (measured by the Armed Forces Qualification Test) and attitudinal/behavioral traits (a latent factor based on self-reported self-esteem, locus of control, educational aspirations and educational expectations) on career wage trajectories of white, black and Latino/a men and women. We find that both cognitive and attitudinal/behavioral traits affect initial wages and wage growth, above and beyond their effects on schooling and transcript-reported high school grades. The relative size of these effects, however, varies by race/ethnicity. We also show that black and Latino men, and black women have substantially flatter wage trajectories than white men and women. Using wage decomposition techniques, we find that the lower wages of these groups are partially, but not fully, accounted for by group differences in cognitive skill and attitudinal/behavioral traits.
0	We identify the characteristics of organizations in California that predict lobbying. Findings indicate a number of straightforward yet striking facts about lobbying  in cross-sectional analyses hospitals, environmental organizations, and organizations located in Sacramento are the most likely to lobby.  The introduction of previous lobbying experience reveals a slightly different trend  the organizations that lobby in an earlier period are far and away the most likely to lobby in subsequent years.  In spite of the strength of this finding, a number of additional factors influence the likelihood of engaging in the activity: environmental organizations and organizations located in Sacramento are more likely to lobby.  These findings suggest that the organizations that lobby, already a small percentage of total nonprofits, actually represent an elite core group.  Lobbying is thus not just a sporadic activity linked to legislation in a specific year; lobbying tends to be either a main component of an organizations repertoire or an activity liked to the type of organization (a particular field).  Even after controlling for previous lobbying, environmental organizations  as a field of organizations  make lobbying a regular activity. Similarly, after controlling for previous lobbying, organizations in Sacramento lobby more.  This finding suggests that either new organizations move to Sacramento with the purpose of lobbying or they discover lobbying because of their proximity to the state capitol.  Finally, when controlling for previous lobbying, hospitals ceases to be significant, suggesting that almost exactly the same hospitals lobby each year.
1	"This article examines four movements of the religiously orthodox that should have failed according to most social movement theory and research. The movements combine (1) an extraordinarily broad agenda, (2) a strict, morally absolutist ideology, and (3) a strong proscription against compromise with other groups, each of which has been identified as a liability that can lead to movement failure. Through inductive, qualitative analyses, the authors identify four shared strategies that helped these movements overcome these obstacles: bypassing the state, building grassroots structures, providing graduated membership, and reprioritizing agendas. Analyses of these movements also suggest that particular combinations of movement ""liabilities"" may actually be advantageous."
0	The Resource Mobilization perspective on social movements often depicts an oversimplified relationship between resources and collective action and has placed little emphasis on systematically developing theories of how that relationship works.  Acknowledging that the costs of collective action and the values of resources vary significantly, this study examines the effects of organizational resources on rates of collective action vis-à-vis ecological models of the social movement sector.  Recent research that assumes an ecological perspective suggests that tactical overlap between social movements influences rates of protest through processes of legitimacy and competition.  However, this research does not simultaneously consider the role of resources and so cannot compare the relative strength of these two theories.  Examining American social movement organizations of the 1960s and 70s and their tactical repertoires, I test resource mobilization and population ecology theories of protest rates using organizational-level data coded from the New York Times.  Preliminary results suggest that effect of tactical overlap on rates of collective action is very weak when compared to that of organizational resources.
0	Even after several decades of research on adolescent sexual activity, researchers and health professionals cannot specify the prevalence of different non-coital activities in the adolescent population or identify the factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of teens involvement in these activities.  We use data from Cycle 6 of the National Survey of Family Growth to estimate the prevalence and identify the correlates of oral-genital contact among unmarried teens and young adults (15 to 21 year olds).  We will use logistic regression to estimate sex-specific models of cunnilingus and fellatio.  Predictors include virginity status, age, race/ethnicity, religion and religious adherence, and socio-economic characteristics.  Our analyses include tests for statistical interactions in order to ascertain whether the observed associations are conditional on virginity status or race/ethnicity.
0	This paper provides an in-depth examination of the link between health during adolescence and educational attainment in early adulthood.  Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 97 and the Children/Young Adults of the NLSY79, I address three questions.  1) Is there variation by social status in the link between health and education?   2) What are the social mechanisms that mediate the connection between adolescent health and educational attainment?  3) Do infant, adolescent and maternal health disparities account for racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in educational achievement?  The results show that the adverse educational consequences of poor health span the socioeconomic spectrum: rather than avoiding the adverse educational consequences of poor health, children with high social status suffer more educationally than their disadvantaged peers.  Secondly, I find that differences in school attendance and performance go furthest in explaining the health/education link.  Finally, the findings suggest that researchers must continue to look for the sources of the elusive racial/ethnic and socioeconomic achievement gaps, since infant, adolescent and maternal health do not play a large role in explaining them.

0	During the 2008 Presidential campaign, women voters were perceived as a powerful voting bloc.  Unlike other previous presidential campaigns, women were visible as candidates and as voters.  Motherhood became a symbolic, visible issue and concern.  This study entails looking at the politics of difference, in this case motherhood,  in the mobilization of a national presidential campaign. The  politics of difference, in politics is about providing legitimacy to experiences, voices and identities that have often gone unrecognized.  The voices of mothers in national presidential campaigns have often gone unrecognized by scholars, activists and politicians. The aims of this national study included a) examining reasons why mothers have become supporters of Barack Obama, b) identifying how mothers have involved themselves in the Obama campaign, c) understanding how mothers engage others, including their children, in their support of Obama, and d) understanding their concerns for their children and their hope in the Obama presidency.  Three hundred fifty six women (n=356) from every state in the U.S. participated in a surveymonkey online survey in May 2008. The key findings included the importance of change for these mothers and their hopes that the Obama presidency would make a difference in their children's lives.  Also, key findings include the engagement that mothers played in this presidential election including using technology to stay engaged and active and encourage other voters to vote for Barack Obama.
1	"In an increasingly knowledge-based global environment, American-style economics may be an especially important form of expertise to understand. Existing studies of the discipline present something of a paradox, however, as some suggest that economic discourse is a logically unified and powerful promarket ideology, while others indicate that in practice it is quite fragmented and constrained. Aseries of 52 interviews with economists working in various jobs is used to reveal a possible way out of this paradox by highlighting three basic features of economic expertise: cognitive and practical framing via a ""core"" of relatively simple ideas and techniques, great flexibility in results due to various available ""subframes,"" and dependence of the selection of subframes on local institutional contexts. These underlying features potentially explain how the unified academic discourse of economics produces a variety of outcomes and maybe even plays a range of quite different social roles in different situations."
0	Data for this paper involve a content analysis of a ten-year period (1993-2002) of JHSB.  The content of the articles were examined by substantive area and four foci:  (1) for explicit policy recommendations by the authors; (2)  for interdisciplinary approaches or focus, which would indicate a commitment toward the proliferation of sociology;  (3)  for explicit statements of sociology as an applied science, and (4) for indications of directional shifts within the practice of the discipline.  We found that the orientation of the articles were toward generating research and theory that shy away from policy, interdisciplinary approaches, and applied clinical issues.  Our discussion focuses on what JHSB is and what it could be.  We suggest that JHSB can help generate and nourish new socio-medical forms of inquiry that can impact the way research questions are framed in order to maximize the applicability of social scientific evidence to health behavior and medical practice.
0	Western European countries experienced unprecedented increases in ethnic diversity over the past 50 years. Droves of immigrants continue to relocate to these economically prosperous nations. In addition to wealth, these nations offer public pension and health care schemes that are critical for the welfare of their citizens, especially those lower in socioeconomic status. Welfare also provides redistribution via taxation that buffers unbridled increases in social stratification. However, ethnic diversity may erode public support for welfare policies ultimately leading to retrenchment. Although this is a phenomenon demonstrated in the U.S., in Western Europe findings are mixed and unconvincing. Data limitations restrict scholars to focusing on national units. We argue that diversity reducing welfare support is a regional phenomenon. In order to test this, we combine data from the European Social Survey with our own unique regional dataset complied from national censuses, the OECD and Eurostat (10 countries; 84 regions; 17,866 individuals). Utilizing multi-level modeling, we find that a greater regional proportion of foreign-born reduces individual support for public health care and old-age welfare.
0	Prior literature suggests that black husbands do more housework than white husbands but Black wives do no more housework than White wives. These studies are limited because they compare only Blacks and Whites,  overlook timing and duration of housework, and do not consider how housework is sequenced with other types of time use. I use time diary data from the 2003-2007 American Time Use Survey to address these limitations. I hypothesize one source of racial-ethnic variation in household work is disparate employment conditions and anticipate the association of economic resources and housework differs by race-ethnicity. Preliminary results indicate race-ethnicity affects hours of housework and associations of earnings with housework vary among women but not men by race-ethnicity. Race-ethnicity does, however, influence men’s hours and probability of engaging in housework.
1	Why did the transition from socialism to capitalism result in improved growth in some countries and significant economic decline in others? Scholars have advanced three main arguments: (1) successful countries rapidly implemented neoliberal policies; (2) failures were not due to policies but to poor institutional environments; and (3) policies were counterproductive because they damaged the state. We present a state-centered theory and empirically demonstrate for the first time one of several possible mechanisms linking neoliberal policies to poor economic performance: mass privatization programs, where implemented, created a massive fiscal shock for post-communist governments, thereby undermining the development of private-sector governance institutions and severely exacerbating the transformational recession. We performed cross-national panel regressions for a sample of 25 post-communist countries between 1990 and 2000 and found that mass privatization programs negatively affected economic growth, state capacity, and property rights protection. We further tested these findings with firm-level data from a representative survey of managers in 3,550 companies operating in 24 post-communist countries. Within countries that implemented mass-privatized programs, newly privatized firms were substantially less likely to engage in industrial restructuring but considerably more likely to use barter and accumulate tax arrears than their state-owned counterparts.
1	"The author engages the sociological theory of ecologically unequal exchange to assess the extent to which levels of per capita anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are a function of the ""vertical flow"" of exports to high-income nations. Results of cross-national fixed effects panel model estimates indicate that levels of such emissions are positively associated with the vertical flow of exports, and the relationship is much more pronounced for lower-income countries than for high-income countries. Additional findings suggest that the observed relationship for lower-income nations has grown in magnitude through time, indicating that structural associations between high-income and lower-income countries have become increasingly ecologically unequal, at least in the context of greenhouse gas emissions. These results hold, net of various important controls. "
1	Most scholars think state administrations vary because rulers attempt to maximize resource extraction given pressure from interstate competition and as constrained by the social structure of the societies they govern. This perspective cannot account for variations in British colonial tax administration in India, circa 1770 to 1855. The British organized land revenue collection and administration as a whole through two different schemes. Both systems initially adopted a rhetoric of revenue maximization, but neither was decisively better matched to Indian social structure. Instead, administrators interpreted a seemingly opaque Indian society by understanding themselves as fundamentally similar to or different from Indians.
0	The environment has become a central issue in many social and economic processes, including the much-heralded environmental side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  In response, social theorists seek to explain the relationship between society and nature.  This study first addresses the evolution of environmental regulation in Mexico as a process of rationalization.  Some environmental sociologists suggest that the development and enforcement of environmental law has improved and will continue to improve with the modernization of Mexicos economy.  Mexico has developed great institutional capacity to regulate its environment, and has instituted innovative and successful programs.  The increase in number of environmental non-governmental organizations and Mexicos participation in international environmental treaties also suggests growing environmental consciousness.  National reactions to genetically modified organisms also suggest the development of a risk society.  However, the Mexican economy continues to be typified by bifurcation, with a substantial informal economy that exists outside regulation, while the formal economy can be described as a vigorous treadmill of production.  Environmental law and its enforcement (or lack thereof) tends to favor capital and reinforce existing patterns of inequality.
0	In Stamford, Connecticut, a multi-union coalition of low-wage service sector workers fights not just for traditional union issues, but also for community concerns.  The multi-union project was initiated by the AFL-CIOs national headquarters, which provides financial support to augment the resources of the locals.  Stamford is an extremely affluent area, with a median family income over $100,000, and serves as the headquarters for eight Fortune 500 corporations.  But the workers in the organizing project are low income, overwhelmingly Black or Latino, and predominantly women.  Stamford has attempted to privatize much of its public housing.  The union coalition has been the driving force fighting this, mobilizing hundreds of workers at several hearings and events.  Union staff do not speak for workers, but rather help train and prepare workers to speak for themselves.  If a worker is fired, for example, the union uses its carefully developed data base to identify all the union members in each area church.  Each churchs workers meet together, discuss the issue, consider their need for allies, and then ask for meetings with their minister and seek the ministers support. This approach has succeeded in unionizing thousands of members and has also won major victories around public housing and immigrant rights.  The paper also discusses some limitations, and notes that it is unclear whether the project will become self-sustaining now that, as planned, the national AFL-CIO is withdrawing its seed-grant funding.
1	Scholars of immigration disagree about the role ethnic communities play in immigrant families' engagement in educational institutions. While some researchers argue that the concentration of disadvantaged ethnic groups may prevent meaningful engagement with schools, others argue that ethnic communities can possess resources that help immigrant families be involved in their children's schooling. In this study we use a nationally representative dataset of Hispanic children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) to determine if the relative size of the Hispanic population in the school affects levels of their parents' involvement in their education, as well as parents' perceptions of barriers to their involvement. Our results suggest that a large Hispanic presence in a child's school can help increase immigrant Hispanic parents' involvement in their children's schooling, but there are no benefits for US-born Hispanic parents, indicating that ethnic communities help immigrant families acculturate to American institutions.

0	While never thoroughly investigated, institutionalized racism has long kept the indigenous population of highland Peru politically isolated and economically marginalized.  This paper adapts recent racial theories to the circumstances of highland Peru.  As such, it bridges the gap between older analyses of structural domination and newer works on cultural politics, uncovering the historically emergent particularities of the current racialized system of domination.  A sketch of the long-term history of highland relations reveals the continuity of a European-descended minority ruling over the indigenous majority through institutionalized networks of patronage.  The various political systems aggrandize local cultural brokers who dictate state policy at the community level.  These dictates generally serve the interests of the brokers to the detriment and continued alienation of the native majority.  In this way, the state controls the indigenous population while keeping it disenfranchised and dependent upon the benevolence of local patrons.
0	Recent experimental evidence has demonstrated how a prison record reduces employment outcomes for entry-level job applicants (Pager 2003). Yet many employers today also have access to applicants arrest records, even for misdemeanor cases that never resulted in formal charges. We here present experimental evidence from a new audit study testing the extent to which employers consider low-level arrest records in making hiring decisions. Our team sent matched pairs of African American and White men to apply for jobs, experimentally manipulating whether they reported or did not report a low-level criminal record during the application process. We find a modest effect of arrest records on employability, with callback rates about 4 percent lower for the experimental group than for the matched control group. Implications for public safety, racial disparities, and the accessibility of arrest records are discussed.
1	Generalized trust varies across individuals and countries. Past studies on trust have demonstrated that voluntary association membership, inequality and ethnic homogeneity at country level are important. However, those studies examined either individual-level or country-level factors separately. In this paper, we conceptualized the emergence of generalized trust as a multilevel process in which the effects of individual-level attributes are influenced by social contexts. Using a multilevel modeling approach on World Values Survey in 48 countries, we estimated a cross-level interaction between voluntary association membership at individual level and income inequality and ethnic homogeneity as two types of social cleavages at country level. We found that the positive effect of voluntary association membership decreases with the level of income inequality.
0	Obesity among children and youth has increased since the 1970s and has become a major in the United States.  The prevalence of obesity is higher among Hispanics of lower socioeconomic status than among white non-Hispanic children. The purpose of this study is to estimate rates and factors associated with obesity among Hispanic and White non-Hispanic children and adolescents using the 2007 National Survey of Childrens Health a nationally representative cross-sectional data.  It examines the effect of socioeconomic status, nativity, language, health insurance, gender and parental well-being of Hispanic and White non-Hispanic childrens physical exercise behavior and weight.  The rates of obesity and the characteristics associated with obesity will be estimated and compared among Hispanics and White non-Hispanic children.   This study will reveal additional findings that can help to provide an understanding the relationship between social and cultural factors that contribute to physical activity and obesity.
1	Research consistently demonstrates that females engage in less criminal behavior than males across the life course, but research on the variability of the gender gap across contexts is sparse. To address this issue, we examine the gender gap in self-reported violent crime among adolescents across neighborhoods. Multilevel models using data from the Project of Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) indicate that the gender gap in violent crime decreases as levels of neighborhood disadvantage increase. Furthermore, the narrowing of the gender gap is explained by gender differences in peer influence on violent offending. Neighborhood disadvantage increases exposure to peer violence for both sexes, but peer violence has a stronger impact on violent offending for females than for males; this produces the reduction in the gender gap at higher levels of disadvantage. We also find that the gender difference in the relationship between peer violence and offending is explained, in part, by (1) the tendency for females to have more intimate friendships than do males and (2) the moderating effect of peer intimacy on the relationship between peer violence and self-reported violent behavior.
0	Which have been Americas most publicized social movement organizations?  In this paper we seek to answer this heretofore unaddressed question, for all national politically oriented SMOs.  Our approach is to generate lists of all such U.S. organizations and then search year by year for each year of the 20th century for mentions in articles in the New York Times.   We then generate rankings of the most publicized SMOs for the century as a whole, in their best year, and by decade.  From there we group them into types and analyze trends.  We find that the most publicized organizations are old-line ones such as those representing labor and veterans, as well as postwar civil rights organizations.  The results suggest, too, that old SMOs have not yet been displaced by new ones in public attention.  The results also indicate a number of groups that stand out for their great publicity without corresponding attention from scholars.  We conclude with some implications and suggestions for further research.
1	In this article, we consider how the economic return to a college education varies across members of the U.S. population. Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis.
1	One of the great paradoxes of inequality in organizations is that even when organizations introduce new programs designed to help employees in traditionally disadvantaged groups succeed, employees who use these programs often suffer negative career consequences. This study helps to fill a significant gap in the literature by investigating how local employer practices can enable employees to successfully use the programs designed to benefit them. Using a research approach that controls for regulatory environment and program design, we analyze unique longitudinal personnel data from a large law firm to demonstrate that assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry improves career outcomes for individuals who later use a reduced-hours program. Additionally, we find that initial assignment to powerful supervisors is more important to positive career outcomes-that is, employee retention and performance-based pay-than are factors such as supervisor assignment at the time of program use. Initial assignment affects career outcomes for later program users through the mechanism of improved access to reputation-building work opportunities. These findings have implications for research on work-family programs and other employee-rights programs and for the role of social capital in careers.
1	Though it has produced a high-quality body of research, the study of substance use has remained highly individualized in its focus. This paper adds further sociological understanding to that research. Using hierarchical models, the following explores how institutional and criminological theories can be incorporated into substance use research by examining cigarette smoking at 3 levels of variation. Two main findings emerge. First, national legal context plays a role in understanding individual-level probabilities of substance use, even after controlling for individual and local characteristics. For example, lower probabilities of smoking occur where there are smoking bans and minimum purchase ages. Second, the effects of local context, such as unemployment and the percentage of young people, exhibit significant effects on individual-level cigarette use.
1	Intimate partner violence is most common in early adulthood. A key developmental task of young adulthood is the formation of intimate partner relationships whether through dating, cohabitation, or marriage. Using the first and third waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine the linkages between relationship type and relationship violence perpetration and victimization among young adults, emphasizing the mediating role of relationship commitment. Among women, cohabitors report significantly higher levels of relationship violence than either marrieds or daters. Among men, cohabitors and marrieds report similar levels of relationship violence and both groups experience more violence perpetration and victimization than daters. Our hypothesis that the weaker relationship commitment of cohabitors accounts for their higher levels of violence is not supported. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	"The theoretical and empirical implications of the structural basis of panethnicity and of the layering of ethnic boundaries in residential patterns are considered while simultaneously evaluating the ""panethnic hypothesis,"" the extent to which homogeneity within panethnic categories can be assumed. Results show a panethnic effect-greater residential proximity within panethnic boundaries than between, net of ethnic group size and metropolitan area that is dependent on immigration. A lower degree of social distance between panethnic subgroups is observed for blacks, whites, and Latinos, and less for Asians, yet ethnonational groups continue to maintain some degree of distinctiveness within a racialized context."
0	This paper reports research investigating the proposition that local public funding for health care in rural areas of the U.S. is more extensive than previously recognized.  County budget data were collected from all counties in nine predominantly rural states for the years 1997, 1999 and 2001.  Findings 1)address the extent to which county tax expenditures are being used to fund local health care services in rural areas, 2)identify the factors that explain the extent to which counties will tax themselves to finance local health care services, and 3)examine which categories of services most commonly receive local public funding and under what conditions.
0	This work presents a microfoundation for general social theory that, though built using modern research into the dual-process model of cognition and the dynamics of mental representation (schema) imposition, also strongly resembles the Homo Sociologicus actor that has historically been characteristic of more “cultural” modes of explanation. In order to systematically elaborate the model’s simple premises into macro-level predictions, the modern theory building tool of agent-based modeling is used (ABM). Some of the early results of this elaboration include implications of interaction patterns for the emergence of system-wide consensus and cultural subgroup patterns, widespread lack of conviction in well-established patterns of behavior, dynamics of “group think,” the effect of position in an interaction network on the likelihood of individuals to engage with culture in either a “motivational” or “justificatory” fashion, and expectations on what patterns of cultural change look like across an interaction network.
1	This article examines to what extent religious context influences giving to, and volunteering for religious causes-both directly and through increased attendance at religious services-and whether it has unintended spillover effects on giving and volunteering for secular purposes. Results from individuals living in a sample of counties in the United States indicate that a high level of religious pluralism is not associated with an increase in the probability that individuals will attend religious services regularly. Religious pluralism is, however directly and positively associated with religious volunteering, while the association is not statistically significant for giving. Increases in religious volunteering associated with a high level of religious pluralism do not displace secular volunteering. There is no minority effect: individuals are equally likely to give to, and volunteer for religious and secular causes whether they live in counties where their religious group represents the majority or the minority of the total population of religious adherents. As the proportion of the population in a county who is religious increases, so does the probability that any one individual will give to, and volunteer for religious causes. I do not, however find a relationship between the devoutness of a religious community and an individual propensity to give to, and volunteer for secular causes.
1	This study tests the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis by examining the age-varying relationships between education, health risks, and disease onset and survival duration. Results based on 20 years of longitudinal data suggest that education is related to both the individual and accumulated number of behavioral, social, and economic health-risks, which in turn, are related to increasing educational differences in rates of disease incidence and survival. For hypertension, behavioral risks fully account for education's negative effect on disease onset whereas educational differences in survival are best explained by the accumulation of social and economic risks. For heart attack, a combination of behavioral, social, and economic risks mediate the association between education and incidence, but neither the individual nor accumulated health-risks could account for education's positive effect on surviving after a heart attack. Similar findings for diabetes and stroke are also discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	The marital relation has long been one of the most studied aspects of family relations.  In our paper we briefly trace the development of theoretical and methodological approaches to the issue of marital quality and show that the field has lacked sufficient theoretical work for adequate scientific analysis of the marital relation.  We argue that the heavy reliance upon marital satisfaction measures incorporates problematic ontological assumptions, assumptions that prevent adequate empirical examination of the marital relation.  Understanding marital quality in terms of marital satisfaction can hide how concerns for marital justice are central to the marital relation and integral to theorizing marital quality.  We draw upon the phenomenological work of Emmanuel Levinas to show how the marital relation is grounded in a responsibility for ones spouse that challenges the primacy of satisfaction in assessments of the marital relation.  We conclude by theorizing how justice rather than satisfaction structures the quality of a marital relationship.
0	A useful method for historical explanation is analysis in terms of power.  This means assessing the power, or ability to affect the outcome in question, of focal actors and entities, determining their use of that power, and, perhaps, accounting for that use.  The first of these depends, in part, methodologically on deductive theory: the power of one entity depends on what others can be expected to do, and theory can help assess that.  The second is mostly historical accounting, but may need theory to determine what goals are feasible for actors.  In the third, theory such as rational choice may be especially useful when the power-holding actor is an aggregate of individuals.  These points are illustrated with examples drawn from the American Revolution.
1	This article describes both sociological and genetic theories of illness causation and derives propositions expected under each and under a transdisciplinary theoretical frame. The authors draw propositions from three theories-fundamental causes, social stress processes, and social safety net theories-and tailor hypotheses to the case of alcohol dependence. Analyses of a later wave of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism reveal a complex interplay of the GABRA2 gene with social structural factors to produce cases meeting DSM/ICD diagnoses. Only modest evidence suggests that genetic influence works through social conditions and experiences. Further, women are largely unaffected in their risk for alcohol dependence by allele status at this candidate gene; family support attenuates genetic influence; and childhood deprivation exacerbates genetic predispositions. These findings highlight the essential intradisciplinary tension in the role of proximal and distal influences in social processes and point to the promise of focusing directly on dynamic, networked sequences that produce different pathways to health and illness.
0	This paper presents research on in-depth, qualitative interviews (N=100) conducted with former and current drug users, in New York City in the months immediately following the attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC).  Most of those in the study sample were regularly users of cocaine and/or heroin.   After the 9/11 attacks, participants reported intense sadness, fear and anxiety.   Contrary to expectations, most did not increase their use of heroin or cocaine to cope with their feelings.  Rather many coped, at least in part, by increasing their use of other - legal -- substances, such as alcohol and prescription medication.  This paper explores the emotional impact of the WTC attacks on a vulnerable population and how decisions about the use of heroin, cocaine, prescription medications, alcohol and cigarettes were related to the aftermath of the WTC disaster.  The subjective experiences of substance users presented in their own words lend insight into the complicated nexus of post-traumatic stress, substance use and poly-drug use.
0	The current paper focuses upon the activities and participation of stroke survivors who have returned home, which serve as markers that help to define ones sense of who and what they are.  In analyzing people who have had a mild stroke and were rated high in physical functioning at discharge and one month after discharge, I am analyzing a group that health professionals generally treat as homogenous.  The research question I attempt to answer in this paper is: Are stroke survivors who are categorized in the same recovery category really having a similar recovery experience?  I attempt to answer this question through analyzing data collected from qualitative interviews with 31 veterans who were recently hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute stroke and discharged home.
0	Bangladeshi children under the age of 10 have experienced significant improvements in nutrition and sex differences in child nutrition have declined significantly during the past decade regardless of family structure, a tremendous change from previous observations in Matlab.  However, our attempts to understand adolescent nutrition and other longitudinal work that studies child nutrition in developing countries are hindered by the lack of an appropriate standard of comparison using a population in developing countries.  The WHO endorsed standard populationbased on U.S. childrenmisclassifies a large number of children in Bangladesh as malnourished, particularly in the adolescent years when rates of obesity in the U.S. begin to rise.  We explore malnutrition in adolescents in Matlab, Bangladesh using the current and past standards, and test the standards for sensitivity to various thresholds to evaluate the current standards and begin a path toward a more appropriate comparison.
1	Social movements' capacity to mount effective challenges often hinges on the availability of scare resources. Yet despite considerable scholarly interest in the ways that resources are mobilized, we know surprisingly little about the conclusion of this process, how movement actors strategically disburse resources to achieve specific goals. Recent attempts to revitalize the American labor movement, particularly efforts to reverse fifty years of membership decline, provide a substantive backdrop for examining resources and success. Data from a sample of local unions and their organizing activities from 1990 through 2001 indicate that tactical resource disbursements do increase the union's ability to recruit new members, but their effect is contingent upon other dimensions of organizing, such as firm and state hostility. The findings extend our understanding of movement agency and offer insight into the growth of social movement unionism today. Keywords: social movements, resource mobilization, labor unions, union organizing, resistance to unions.
0	"The paper documents two broad theoretical transitions in the history of criminal courtroom studies by criminologists, sociologists and lawyers. The first transition, which I call ""from norm to practice"", reflects the field's break from the world of legal-normative criminal justice studies. It is a shift from a focus on prescriptive norms, and from a paradigm of designing balance between abstract contrasting values, to a focus on the ways in which rules are implemented in the actual practices of the court. The second transition, ""from 'practice' to 'discourse'"", reflects a shift from this aim to uncover what ""really"" happens in the criminal process to the rejection of any such ""reality"", and toward an exploration of how law conceptualizes its chosen ""reality"", and of how these ""realities"" have come to be. These transitions transcend disciplinary traditions and divides. Using a variety of examples, the paper traces the theoretical frameworks, favored methodologies, strengths and flaws that brought about each of the two transitions, and suggests a few hybrid models that might fuel future transitions."
1	This paper analyzes temporal variations in two gender attitudes in China: beliefs about gender equality and perspectives on women's combined work and family roles. It uses the most currently available population series from the 1995, 2001 and 2007 World Value Surveys of 4500 respondents and a series of multilevel cross-classified models to properly estimate period and cohort effects. Attitudes toward women's dual roles manifest neither period nor cohort effects; the population displays a universal high level of acceptance of women's paid employment. Orientations toward gender equality manifest both cohort and period effects: members of the youngest cohort of both sexes hold the most liberal attitudes; the positive effect of college education has increased over time. Attitude toward gender equality in China displays neither a shift toward conservatism nor an over-time trend toward egalitarianism in 1995-2007, a time of rapid economic growth.

1	Although the relationship between educational attainment and parenting practices is well documented, it is typically examined at only one point in time. What happens if mothers acquire more education after the birth of their children: do they alter their parenting practices? Panel data models based on longitudinal data from ECLS-K indicate that changes in mother's educational attainment are positively associated with increases in parental school involvement, having books in the home, and participating in non-academic family activities, but not with attitudes toward discipline. Although post-natal maternal education does not change all aspects of parenting, our findings are broadly consistent with the theory of cultural mobility and provide insights into the extent of socio-cultural mobility in contemporary American society. 
1	Most prior research testing the hypothesis of the social disorganization theory that residential instability increases crime has used cross-sectional data. Using a unique dataset linking home sales address matched to census tracts with crime data in Los Angeles, we test the direction of this relationship using a six-year panel data design. We also test whether crime acts as a generator of transition and decline in neighborhoods by testing its effect on property values the following year. Our findings suggest little evidence that home sales volatility in one year leads to more property or violent crime the following year. Instead, higher levels of tract property and violent crime in one year lead to more home sales the following year. This effect of high crime rates is exacerbated in tracts with high levels of racial/ethnic heterogeneity, suggesting that such tracts may engender a distinct combination of fear and uncertainty in their residents, leading to more turn over. We also find that tracts with more violent crime one year have lower property values the following year, suggesting a general process of decline.
0	Traditionally, housing justice advocates have worked within single issue social movement frames based on either race (fair housing) or class (affordable housing). But the public housing crisis in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina provides movement actors with an opportunity to produce intersectional analysis and tactics that include the racial analysis that is often omitted. Following the announcement of the closure of four public housing developments since Katrina, advocates have cultivated both singular (class only) and intersectional (race and class) frames, suggesting a struggle over framing that will play itself out this year. In light of the national significance of these HUD closures as a possible test case for the end of public housing across the country, the strategic choices housing actors in New Orleans make will provide a useful glimpse into the possibilities for multi-racial race-based, intersectional social movement strategy in housing justice.
0	Adolescents expectations of earning a college degree have become increasingly widespread, but for many such expectations will not be realized. This paper examines trends in how expectations persist or change in young adulthood, and asks whether persistent plans for a college degree in lieu of attainment are on the rise and how such plans are socially patterned. Panel data on 15 consecutive classes of high school seniors show that a growing percent of young adults persist in their plans to get a college degree even if none had been obtained by their early 30s. Persistence was more common among racial/ethnic minorities and among students with greater levels of college-going resources in the form of college-educated parents, a college preparatory high school program, and above average past grades. Overall, though, this was a rare pathway. The greatest changes were a drop in never expecting a college degree and an increase in successfully realizing plans to earn one. Cooling out or warming up expectations were fairly uncommon pathways and did not exhibit much change across cohorts. We also present evidence of cohort changes in the influence of gender and family/academic background on the probability of fulfilling college degree expectations versus other pathways.
0	This paper provides an overview of the major issues surrounding the controversial education reform of school vouchers.  It argues that in spite of the suspicion that many on the left have of vouchers as a right-wing market-based reform that will simply reinforce existing inequalities, vouchers can have, if carefully and properly designed, progressive consequences for low-income students in urban areas.  However, the type of voucher plan I propose is significantly at odds with the free-market style voucher plan that that is often associated with the reform.
0	Seminal works in the sociology of education focused the school as an agent of socialization.  Schools require students to master a hidden curriculum where students are taught the norms that allow them to fit into the larger society.  In this study, I examined how students early pre-school experiences  whether they attended preschool, and if so, what kind of schooling experiences they had   affect how well they have mastered the hidden curriculum at the beginning of kindergarten.  The results suggest that students who attend preschool programs were slightly better socialized into the student role at the beginning of kindergarten than kindergarteners who did not have any formal school experiences prior to kindergarten.  In contrast, kindergarten students who were in Head Start and daycare were less well socialized than kindergarteners without any formal schooling, and these negative effects persisted through the end of kindergarten.
0	"In this paper, I present a framework for analyzing discourse on the roles of modern women in colonized states by conducting a case study in Korea. Modern western practices brought the ontological concept of an ideal new woman as an equal being into the colonized world, but social opportunities for women were enormously limited to a handful of occupations and social roles. By comparing the trajectories of three women against the ideal woman figure drawn from Yi Gwang-su's Mujeong (1917), one of the most popular novels in the period, I show how the social construction of ""the ethical"" resulted in the ostracism of women from society. Within the context of Western imperialism, the colonized faced the immediate need of building civilized/civilizing subjects for (re-)creation of their own nation state. In the course of constructing these civilized subjects, the ethical was shaped and reshaped through both the encouragement and repression of the ideal figure of sinyeoseong (new women), providing loose sets of encouragement and censure, regulation and violence. The production, reorganization, and reconstruction of the ethical explain the earlier successes and the later social deaths of the first generation of new women."
1	This study examines how young immigrants are faring in new destinations using individual level data front the 2000 IPUMS to assess the relative roles of race/ethnicity, nativity, country of origin, and place on the likelihood of not being enrolled in high school for youth aged 15-17. I found that place plays a nuanced role in the risk of non-enrollment that varies by nativity as well as other household characteristics. While children in general have higher risks of dropping out in new destination communities relative to those in established immigrant communities, the risks to immigrant children are even greater. I found that Mexican and Guatemalan origin immigrants are particularly vulnerable, especially in places with the largest increases in the percent foreign born. The implications of these findings for both immigrants and their communities are discussed in the conclusion. 
0	This paper utilizes qualitative and archival research to analyze the field of community development corporations in Cleveland, Ohio, in order to examine the topography of contemporary urban civil society. These organizations claim to mediate between communities and systemic processes and between private and public concerns; they claim to be hybrid organizations. Yet few analyses of civil society organizations attempt to determine the reality of this claim in a systematic fashion. We attempt to address the question using data on fifty-one organizations over eight years. The data is analyzed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis, a method for representing commonalities and differences in categorical data in relationally-defined, multi-dimensional space. The analysis reveals an organizational field that is unified around commitments to physical development, community authority, and collaborative practices. The field is nonetheless divided by two dominant oppositions: degree of professionalization, amount and content of social capital. Within these, the analysis finds a powerful opposition between orientations to private and public institutional settings. These oppositions are dealt with in highly varied ways. We identify five organizational clusters, two of which can be said to be hybrid organizations and only one of which effectively mediates between private and public. Most urban civil society organizations are that in name only, though the dominant position in the field is the one that realizes the claims of civil society advocates most effectively.
1	A new approach to the statistical estimation of age-period-cohort (APC) accounting models, called the intrinsic estimator (IE), recently has been developed. This article (1) further describes the IE algebraically, geometrically, and verbally, (2) reviews properties of the IE as a statistical estimator, (3) provides model validation evidence for the IE both from an empirical example and from a simulation exercise, (4) relates the coefficients of the IE to those of conventional constrained APC models using formal definitions of statistical estimability, hypothesis testing, and empirical applications that directly address a criticism that often has been lodged at general-purpose methods of APC analysis, and (5) introduces computer software for application of the IE that interested users can readily access. The authors conclude that the IE holds the potential for applications not only to APC analysis but also to similar problems of structural underidentification in sociology.
1	This article examines national identification from a comparative and multilevel perspective. Building on the identity, nationalism, and prejudice literatures, I analyze relationships between societies' economic, political, and cultural characteristics (e.g., development, globalization, democratic governance, militarism, and religious and linguistic diversity), individual characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status and minority status), and preferences for the content of national identities. I also examine relationships between national identity content and public policy preferences toward immigration, citizenship, assimilation, and foreign policy, generally. I use confirmatory factor analysis and multilevel modeling to analyze country-level data and survey data from 31 countries (from the International Social Survey Program 2003 National Identity II Module). Results suggest that individual and country characteristics help account for the variable and contested nature of national identification. Moreover the content of national identity categories has implications for public policy and intergroup relations.
0	While there are social psychologists in both psychology and sociology departments, cross departmental team taught courses on psychology and sociology, especially introductory courses, are rare.  In this paper, we describe an interdisciplinary team taught introductory sociology and psychology course.  The course serves as a gateway or introductory course to upper division courses in both psychology and sociology.  We describe the origins, content, assessment, challenges and rewards of creating an introductory sociology and psychology course.
0	This paper reports partial findings of a larger project based on open-ended semi-strucutred interviews with young adults about their memories of learning about sex particularly during adolescence. The cohort that were adolescents during the first decade of the 21st century matured in a cultural landscape dominated by two polarized discourses of sexuality. The first was the formal sexual education curriculum of abstinence-only and the second was the wide variety of sexual content available on high-speed internet. This research explores in particular the role that formal sexual education played in the lives of participants during adolescence. Participants specifically described remembering the context of sexual education, specific content of sexual education. In addition, participants reported their evaluation of the sexual education they received in hindsight as adults. Results include that overall participants described their formal sexual education as irrelevant, incomplete, and generally negative. As a result, many participants sought out sexual information on the Internet.
1	This article offers a theoretical and methodological system for a sociological analysis of the restless nature of historical events. This system, political semiosis, is able to identify and assess the performative speech acts, the demonstrative orientational specifications, and the mimetic representations required to advance historical transformations. The features of political semiosis structure the flow of historical events by managing the specific media and generic forms that are the vehicles through which events take shape. Political semiosis provides a method for analyzing both the circulation and the materialization of events. The exemplary case of September 11 illuminates this approach's capabilities.
0	Migration and its accompanying stressors influence the mental health status of immigrants.  Limited is known about how the contexts of migration affect mental disorders, particularly among Asian Americans.  This study examined the mental health impacts of three factors: whether migration was voluntary, how well migrants prepared for migration and reasons for migration.  Data were obtained from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS).  Logistic and multiple regression analyses were used to estimate the mental health effects of premigration factors among Asian immigrants.  Results indicated that 70% of the immigrants migrated voluntarily, 50% of them were well-prepared for the migration, and 70% migrated for socioeconomic reasons.  The associations between premigration factors and mental health were different for men and women.  Among women, those who had carefully planned the migration, compared with those with no or poor plans had lower rates of affective disorders and anxiety disorders in the past year.  Among men, those migrating for socioeconomic reasons had less psychological distress compared to those migrating for political reasons.  Results indicated that contexts of migration were significant predictors of mental health status of Asian immigrants, but in different ways for men and women.
1	Research on the emotional consequences of interactive service work remains inconclusive in large part because scholars have not analyzed the mechanisms that lead frontline employees to adopt the meanings disseminated by their employers. The authors argue that the theoretical framework best suited for remedying this situation is the negotiated order perspective. It suggests that whether employees adopt a corporate-sanctioned meaning, and with what emotional effect, depends on the conjunction of several social conditions. The authors also propose a novel analytical strategy that can identify these conditional pathways and formalize the combinatorial logic of the negotiated order perspective: fuzzy-set techniques. To illustrate the utility of this approach, the article examines a university hospital that has tried to create a more meaningful and emotionally rewarding work environment for its nursing staff. Consistent with expectations, findings show that employees can embrace the same corporate-sanctioned meaning under different sets of conditions and with different emotional consequences.
0	This paper is a qualitative study of familism and family, friends and neighbor (FFN) childcare providers. We analyzed the FFN caregivers perceptions of why parents choose informal childcare and the importance of relationships in those decisions.  Areas addressed include parent-caregiver relationships, caregiver-child relationships and the familism created in these relationships.  Interviews conducted with thirty-three Mexican American FFN caregivers in San Antonio, Texas were tape-recorded, transcribed and coded for emerging themes.  Flexibility, trust and relationships, and affordability make home childcare the leading choice among Hispanics.
1	This study uses survey data to test the correlation between empathic concern and 14 different prosocial. behaviors, including informal help to individuals and formal helping through institutions. Statistically significant correlations were found for 10 behaviors, but substantively meaningful correlations were only found for three, all of which were spontaneous, informal helping behaviors, where the individual needing help was directly present. The findings indicate that empathic concern may not be an important motivator for planned helping decisions and decisions to help others who are not immediately present, such as volunteering, charitable giving, and blood donation. The weak correlation between empathic concern and most helping behaviors indicates that individual differences in empathic concern may not play much a role in helping decisions.

0	This paper examines the interplay between social identity and social networks among unmarried women in rural Malawi.  We draw upon survey and qualitative data from a sub-set (N=258) of the 2004 youth sample as part of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP).  Evidence from the survey data indicate that those who managed to stay in school were significantly more likely to abstain from sex, controlling for important covariates.  The survey data also show that key characteristics of social networks were significantly different among girls still schooling versus those who were not.  In the qualitative interviews, schoolgirls often said their friends encouraged each other to study hard, and that schooling and sex were incompatible:  having a boyfriend disturbs the mind, thus interfering with educational attainment and the opportunities that might follow. Moreover, as young women approach the average age of marriage and drop-out rates increase, those who remain in school are identified by others, and identify themselves, as elites in their community, and they come to adopt a set of repertoires and practices that serve to continuously affirm their identities as educated and modern.
0	The paper examines violence in the North American anti-globalization movement. It indexes actual practices (revealing that rigid violence/non-violence dichotomies are untenable), explores the relationships between militant activities in the movement and major social movements theories of violence and non-violence, discusses the ways in which the conflict is being dealt with in the movement, and discusses what is at stake in the international differences around definitions of non-violence.
1	Students' social psychological adjustment to school is an important determinant of achievement growth as well as school continuation and post-secondary educational attainment. Yet many students begin high school with low levels of efficacy and self-worth, and low levels of identification with and liking of school. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that vocational education in high school provides disengaged students with an educational clean slate, leading to a recovery of engagement for at-risk students. Using propensity score models, we assess the relationship between vocational course taking and changes in effort, extracurricular participation, sense of belonging, interest in school, attitudes toward school and teachers, educational expectations, career aspirations, locus of control, and self-concept with the NELS:88 database. 
0	The pupose of this paper is to address the problem of the gap between teaching and practice higher education and to examine the implications for teaching sociology and creating community base change. The objective is to develop at least four reasons for teaching and developing applied sociology and practice in the community.
0	The underclass concept pervades sociological literature on poverty and race relations but remains a contested issue for many reasons. One problematic component of the underclass concept is the substantial ambiguity surrounding the meaning of “underclass.” Another problematic component of the underclass concept is its pejorative connotation, which suggests that this group is “under” or “inferior” to the rest of society and associated with stereotypes of poverty. In this presentation, we review the evolution of the underclass concept and examine how current sociological research applies this term to Latinos and undocumented workers. Within sociology, the underclass concept is both accepted and rejected as useful and appropriate for explaining the current situation of Latinos and undocumented workers. We argue that Wilson’s conceptualization of the underclass cannot be meaningfully applied to Latinos and undocumented workers because their experience is profoundly different from urban blacks. One difference is that Latinos living in the U.S. do not presently experience disproportionately high levels of residential segregation. Additionally, undocumented workers do not experience the same barriers to employment as the black underclass. According to Wilson, the underclass lacks marketable skills and access to jobs. Comparatively, undocumented workers often have access to employment but lack the security of citizenship and the resources to gain English proficiency. Yet, these barriers do not prevent employers from aggressively recruiting and hiring them for low-wage, low-skill jobs. We argue that policy makers need to conceptualize the underclass concept to consider different experiences of inequality and disadvantage in the global economy.
1	"Through an historical case study, this article addresses how and why physicians carry radical logics into medicine. The radical logic of focus is psychopathology. Obstetrics and gynecology was one of the very first specialties outside of psychiatry to incorporate this logic into its work culture. Employing a core-skill conflict perspective, this article shows that obstetricians and gynecologists' failure to ""deliver the goods"" promised in their core-skill definition invited aggressive responses by general surgeons against their turf claims. Obstetricians and gynecologists embraced psychopathology in the early post-World War II period (1945 through the 1960s) to improve their diagnostic and surgical outcomes in the hope that this would drive surgeons away from their markets. Because of this market promise, obstetricians and gynecologists agreed to serve in a subordinate, screening role in their relationship with psychiatrists. The study illustrates the impact of both negotiated and conflictual interspecialty relations on the programs physicians use to carry radical logics into medicine."
0	I examine the modes and avenues of interaction based on lived experiences of an individual with multiple and progressive disabilities.  The period of research extends over fifteen years prior to, and nearly fifteen years after, becoming symptomatic with a progressive neurological disorder manifesting tumors that have caused deafness, chronic fatigue, as well as permanent facial palsy.  The multifaceted perspectives arising out of life experiences, that just happened to be part of my life as well as everyone I have interacted with, contribute to our understanding of how to catalyze greater inclusiveness within society.  This furthers the project of understanding ourselves and relations with, as well as to, others.
1	This paper test predictions from three social science explanations as to how sex differences in attainment of partnership and how women's perceptions of sex discrimination should have changed as women have been integrated into law. Men's and women's partnership rates 15 years after graduation and women's reports of sex discrimination are compared for two cohorts of University of Michigan Law School graduates: the classes of 1972 to 1978 and the classes of 1979 to 1985. Four stages at which women are selected out of, or select themselves out of, the path to partnership are investigated: (1) career plans at graduation; (2) entry into a firm; (3) early attrition from firm practice; and (4) the attainment of partnership among non-attriters. The sex gap in attaining partnership dropped across cohorts, primarily due to declines in sex differences at the first three stages; but sex differences in the percentage of non-attriters who were partners 15 years after graduation declined little across cohorts, both before and after controlling for career plans, legal specialization, work experience, law school grades, and family situations. And in both cohorts, roughly 90 percent of women reported experiences of sex discrimination. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	Large numbers of foreign-born residents in the United States mean that many people receive at least part of their education abroad. Despite this fact, our understanding of nativity differences in the success of adults and their children is based on research that does not empirically consider variation in the benefits to schooling depending on where it is received. We use data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS) to examine: (a) whether the socioeconomic and cognitive returns to education depend on whether it is received in the U.S. or abroad; and (b) whether schooling location partially accounts for nativity differences in these returns. We find that the returns to schooling are generally largest for adults who receive at least some of their highest level of education in the U.S. The beneficial effects of U.S. schooling are more pronounced at higher levels of educational attainment. Schooling location accounts for a sizeable fraction of the lower socioeconomic and cognitive returns of the foreign-born, relative to natives; some meaningful differences remain, however. In addition, the higher cognitive skills of the children of foreign-born adults remain unexplained. Although we cannot distinguish among the possible pathways underlying these associations (e.g., school quality, transferability of credentials, the timing of immigration) our findings suggest the importance of considering factors related to schooling location as predictors of socioeconomic and cognitive success in the United States.

1	Americans often rely on meritocratic ideologies rather than structural factors to explain unequal labor market outcomes, but we know little about how such beliefs are contingent upon individuals' social locations. Taking advantage of unique survey data, this article examines how gender inequality in professional advancement is explained among successful women professionals in science, technology, and allied fields-an employment arena potentially characterized simultaneously by potent meritocratic ideologies and persistent gendered barriers. Using multinomial logistic regressions comparing structural and meritocratic frames for explaining the paucity of women at high levels, we show how respondents in different career and family circumstances use these conflicting perceptual lenses. We find that married women, those with business education, and those in the top levels of their organizations are more likely to account for gender inequality by invoking deficiencies in women's human capital or motivation, whereas mothers, primary breadwinners, sellers of professional services, and those working in unsupportive organizations are more likely to invoke structural explanations. This research has implications for social action. Successful women's beliefs about gender inequality may influence whether they help remove structural obstacles for other women, or whether, through adherence to the meritocratic ideology, they help reconstruct the glass ceilings they have cracked.
0	This research integrates the education and labor market literatures by examining the relation between education track in secondary school and wage and salary income for boys and girls of different racial/ethnic groups.  Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study, 1988-2000, we find that, regardless of race, men who study in lower academic tracks have higher incomes than white women studying on the academic track.  Thus, a higher track does not help women overcome the gender gap in wages.  However, among women, tracking helps explain the racial gap in wages.  The incomes of black and white women are bolstered by studying on rigorous academic tracks.  Furthermore, white womens incomes are higher when they studied on academic as opposed to general tracks.  Interestingly, when black males on academic track are the excluded category, we do not find the same racial gaps in income, suggesting that racial gaps in income are greater for women than men, and track placement helps minimize racial inequalities for women moreso than it does for men.
1	"Using data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, we show that women who report that religion is ""very important"" in their everyday life have both higher fertility and higher intended fertility than those saying religion is ""somewhat important"" or ""not important."" Factors such as unwanted fertility, age at childbearing or degree of fertility postponement seem not to contribute to religiosity differentials in fertility. This answer prompts more fundamental questions: what is the nature of this greater religiosity? And why do the more religious want more children? We show that those saying religion is more important have more traditional gender and family attitudes and that these attitudinal differences account for a substantial part of the fertility differential. We speculate regarding other contributing causes."
0	Studies document important relationships between religiosity and health status.  Most epidemiologic studies of religion have restricted measurement of religious involvement to church participation or prayer.  No study has examined the religious motivation of elders with cardiac health problems.  In this study measures of ends, means, and quest religious motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation, and formal and informal religious participation.  The sample is comprised of 342 older adults living independently in Worcester, MA.  Comparisons between the 81 elders who reported heart trouble and the larger sample reveal an unanticipated pattern of religious involvement.  Those with cardiac health problems were not intrinsically oriented (p < .05) as expected, rather they were extrinsically oriented (p < .005) and questing (p < .05), specifically doubting (p < .05).  At T2 their doubting no longer differed from other older adults.  These findings serve as a warning that elders with heart trouble may be questioning their faith and not seeking religious support.
1	This article examines whether correlates Of cross-national homicide variation tested with data from highly developed, predominantly Western nations could also explain homicide rates in East-Central Europe. Using pooled time-series analyses of data from nine countries from 1990 through 2003, this study found that homicide rates were negatively related to GDP/capita and positively related to ethnic diversity and population density. They were also negatively related to the percentage of young people and not significantly related to income inequality or divorce rates. This article also investigates whether conditions specific to the post-communist transformations contributed to homicide variation. Findings indicate that progressive reforms toward democratization and marketization decreased homicide rates. The discussion uses the socio-historical context of the nations to explain-these results.
0	This research moves the worlds great cities to the center of contemporary debates about globalization.  We use a social network approach, viewing cities as important nodes in a worldwide web of exchanges.  Our central questions include:  Which cities are more central in the network of world cities?  Which are peripheral?  Is the network of cities growing more tightly integrated over recent time?  Do cities roles in the global network reflect those of the nations in which they are located, or are they becoming independent of national trajectories?  Finally, how is social life within cities influenced by their role in the global network?  The research will use formal network techniques to analyze data on flows of airline passengers and air cargo between all pairs of some 150-200 cities, comparing patterns in 1990 to those in 2000.  The study will evaluate untested theoretical claims about the social consequences of global positioning of cities on social structural change within them.  It will contribute to scholarly as well as popular debates about globalization.  At the same time, it will begin to build a world city network database that will be available to other scholars.  We also hope to contribute to a number of important public policies debates, as well.  The data and results should be relevant to discussions of and nation-based strategies for global economic competitiveness, the role for the state in promoting development, possible trade offs between growth and polarization/ inequality, and long-term challenges presented by emergent patterns and processes of globalization at the beginning of the 21st century.
0	This essay compares and contrasts two ideal types of sociology: professional and public. Each is engaged in what Howard Becker calls telling about society (2007). However, their rhetorical stances differ in two essential ways: audience and voice. First, what audience are they telling the story tosociology for whom? Second, how are they telling the storywhose voice? Professional sociologists rely on the scholarly article to tell their stories to fellow experts. This work argues that the essay is a genre particularly suited for public sociologists seeking an audience of well-informed citizens.
1	A burgeoning literature considers the consequences of mass imprisonment for the well-being of adult men and-albeit to a lesser degree-their children. Yet virtually no quantitative research considers the consequences of mass imprisonment for the well-being of the women who are the link between (former) prisoners and their children. This article extends research on the collateral consequences of mass imprisonment by considering the association between paternal incarceration and maternal mental health using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Results show that recent paternal incarceration increases a mother's risk of a major depressive episode and her level of life dissatisfaction, net of a variety of influences including prior mental health. The empirical design lends confidence to a causal interpretation: effects of recent incarceration persist even when the sample is limited to mothers attached to previously incarcerated men, which provides a rigorous counterfactual. In addition, the empirical design is comprehensive; after isolating key mechanisms anticipated in the literature, we reduce the relationship between recent paternal incarceration and maternal mental health to statistical insignificance. These results imply that the penal system may have important effects on poor women's well-being beyond increasing their economic insecurity, compromising their marriage markets, or magnifying their risk of divorce.
0	In this paper, we take the holon approach to ecology and environment we have been working on with regard to agroecology and extend it into a discussion of ecological power.  In our use of a holon approach, we seek to take account of the reality of intentionality, human and otherwise, in ecology.  Fundamental to this approach is a recognition that parts and wholes never absolutely exist, and yet as well a recognition that intentionalities seek to construct boundaries in an ever-changing, unfinalizable, and incommensurate ecology of contexts.  Ecological power is the ability of a holon to sustain its intentionality from and among the many agencies of its ecology of contexts—which, perhaps paradoxically, requires near-constant change.  As we will describe, ecological power is centrally dependent upon the successful construction of a holonic narrative, from and among the ecology of contexts.  We will also describe how holonic narratives vary in degree to which they are inclusionary and exclusionary, and the degree to which they are dialogic and monologic.  Which all sounds pretty dull and theoretical, but we will endeavor to show otherwise.
0	Using a nationally representative sample of adolescents, we examine the existence of a popularity or friendship penalty for high-performing blacks. We attempt to adjudicate between arguments that suggest black youth ostracize high achievers and those that suggest institutional structures shape black students’ friendship opportunities. We find little support for the interpretation of the negative relationship between high achievement and same-race friendships among black students as an indication of a “burden of acting white.”  Instead, we find evidence consistent with the institutional argument.  Among black students, there is a negative association between being in an advanced course and same-race friendships, but this association is reversed once the proportion of the school that is black reaches about 50%. We also find similar results for the association between achievement and same-race friendship nominations: high-performing black students are more popular than their lower-performing peers when they are in majority-black environments. In fact, regardless of school context, the higher a black student’s GPA, the less likely she is to report depression. Similarly, black students in advanced courses are no more likely to be depressed compared to their black peers in regular courses, and this relationship is robust across school contexts involving varied racial compositions.
0	This paper reports findings from an empirical study designed to test the hypotheses that project-induced migration is a stressor that would negatively affect the mental well-being of involuntary migrants and that the harmful effects of the stressor can be ameliorated by the protective resources migrants possess.  The study is guided by the stress process model (Ensel and Lin 1991; Pearlin 1989; Thoits 1995), a paradigm which has been used extensively by American researchers to explain associations between exposure to different types of stressors and symptoms of psychological stress but with unknown generalizability to a different culture.  Data used in the analysis were collected from a sample of Chinese who would be displaced by Chinas Three Gorges project; non-migrants from the same region are also included as the control group.  Our findings indicated that involuntary migration is a significant predictor of depression.  Controlling for social, political, and psychological resources, as well as preexisting chronic strains and other stressors reduces, but not completely eliminates, the statistically significant difference in the level depression between involuntary migrants and their non-migratory counterparts.
1	Does the race of inter-viewers introduce a bias in estimating the test score gap between blacks and whites in the United States? To answer this question, I use an adult sample from the General Social Survey (GSS) in which vocabulary testing involves face-to-face and one-on-one interaction between the respondent and the interviewer, I find that black respondents perform better when tested by a black interviewer as opposed to a white interviewer. For white respondents, however, the race of the interviewer does not have a significant impact on test performance. Because most black respondents are tested by white interviewers in the GSS, the test performance of black respondents is downward biased, and the black-white test score gap is overestimated. 
0	This paper critiques recent work in economic sociology and develops an analytical framework that distinguishes between embedded and disembedded exchanges using the concepts of use and exchange value. Consistent with the literature in economic sociology, a great deal of economic action is embedded in social relations that inhibit the operation of the market and, thus, is guided by considerations of use value. This type of exchange is characterized by market failure and transaction costs. In contrast to the literature in economic sociology, certain transactions within capitalist economies are structured to prohibit the intrusion of non-market considerations into exchange relations by creating barriers to cooperation and collaboration among actors and, thus, foster allocations guided primarily by exchange value. Property rights and hard budget constraints are instrumental in producing this form of socially constructed atomization. After illustrating the utility of this analytical framework through a case study of privatization in Mexico, I argue that the new economic sociology must pay closer attention to the mechanisms by which markets may be constructed to resemble the asocial models of neoclassical economics.
0	This paper explores the relationship between state formation, state decision-making processes, and the experience of technology for the newly-industrialised Southeast Asian economy of Singapore. I argue that globalisation is both the context as well as the impetus in the continuous formation of the Singapore states technocratic ideology. Specifically, I examine how globalisation conditions and affects the states legitimacy between the two poles of (i) democratic socialism and (ii) the rhetoric of crisis and survival. By identifying the main political agents and institutions, I chart how the states ideology of pragmatism is materially and culturally employed as a local response to globalisation. In examining the historically contingent formation of the Singaporean nation-state, I also demonstrate how the technological trope is used to construct a national identity for Singapore not in its past but in its future.
0	This study applies multilevel analyses to 23 Demographic and Health Surveys collected between 2000 and 2008 to examine the associations between family structure and child vaccination in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with a specific focus on fathers. There are only a handful of studies on the influence fathers have on their children’s health in SSA, and results from these studies are mixed. The current study first considers whether partnered mothers invest in more disease preventing vaccinations for their children than single-mothers. The study then determines if, among children with partnered mothers, fathers’ education increases investment in child vaccination. Though fathers’ presence and education increase family’s investment in child vaccination, the relationships vary cross-nationally. The prevalence of polygynous unions in the country helps to explain this cross-national variation. The findings overwhelming support the further inclusion of fathers in research on children’s health in SSA.
0	Millions of Americans access the Internet for health information, which is changing the way patients seek information and how they often treat certain medical conditions.  It is estimated that there may be as many as 100,000 health-related Web sites.  The availability of so much health information permits consumers to assume more responsibility for their own health care.  At the same time, it raises a number of important issues that need to be addressed.  The health information available to Internet users may be inaccurate or out-of-date.  Potential conflicts of interest result from the blurring of the distinction between advertising and professional health information.  Also, potential threats to privacy may result from data mining.  Health care consumers need to be able to evaluate the quality of the information provided on the Internet.  Various evaluative mechanisms such as codes of ethics, rating systems, and seals of approval have been developed to aid in this process.  The effectiveness of these solutions, however, needs to be evaluated.  Finally, the last issue this paper attempts to address is the importance of including patients in developing standardized quality assurance systems for online health information.
1	Many theories either implicitly or explicitly assume that individuals readily move to places that improve their financial well-being. Other forces, however, offset these tendencies; for example, people often wish to remain close to family and friends. We introduce a methodology for determining how individuals weigh these countervailing forces, and estimate how both financial and social factors influence geographic mobility in the Danish population. Our results suggest that individuals respond to opportunities for higher pay elsewhere, but that their sensitivity to this factor pales in comparison to their preferences for living near family and friends.
0	This paper explains how a free-trade agenda survived a wave of protectionist sentiments in the early 1970s in the United States. I argue that internationalists maintained the liberal agenda by establishing new institutional arrangements which constrained the political influence of protectionist industries. While the argument follows a historical institutionalist logic, it attempts to use the case-study to offer a new conceptualization of the nature of institutions by considering the interaction between political actors and institutions as embodied not only in the political actors, but also in the institutions themselves, and by considering temporality while analyzing the impacts of such interactions. Three arguments follow. First, institutions are the solidified reflection of the balance of social forces at the moment of their creation. This implies that the uneven distribution of benefits across social groups by institutions is an intended outcome of those who had designed the institutions. Second, the causal effectiveness of institutions is not a result of their independence from social forces as much as their ability to intensify relations of power or to reflect a balance of social forces that no longer exists. Third, unanticipated effects within given institutional arrangements are not the outcome of unintended consequences but of intended strategies.
1	Scholarly inquiry into collective memory has fostered a host of innovative questions, perspectives, and interpretations about how individuals and communities are both constituted by the past and mobilize it for present-day projects. Race is one of the more important current issues demonstrating how the presence of the past is both potent and sorrowful in the United States. It is therefore critical to examine how memories of racial oppression, conflict, and reconstruction shape race relations. Studies of race relations, however generally ignore collective memory role in shaping racial norms and attitudes. This article uses the 1993 General Social Survey to address the silences in the collective memory and race relations literatures by examining how Americans' recollections of the civil rights movement influence their racial attitudes and racial policy preferences. Although we find that Americans' opinions about government programs targeting African Americans are unrelated to civil rights memory, respondents who spontaneously recalled the civil rights struggle and its victories as an especially important historical event generally expressed more racially liberal opinions than did those with different memories. Our findings both support the basic presupposition of collective memory studies-memory matters-and point to a fruitful innovation in the study of racial attitudes.
1	Researchers have found that religious participation is correlated with marital satisfaction. Less is known about whether religion also benefits participants in nonmarital, intimate relationships or whether religious effects on relationships vary by gender. Using data from the first three waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we find that religious participation by fathers, irrespective of marital status, is consistently associated with better relationships among new parents in urban America; however, mothers' participation is not related to relationship quality. These results suggest that religious effects vary more by gender than by marital status. We conclude that mend investments in relationships appear to depend more on the institutional contexts of those relationships, such as participation informal religion.
1	"The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented. Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on ""detainee abuse"" at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003) ""constructionist analytics,"" I examine the textual mediation of claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing participants put these realities. I show that developments in the textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a textually mediated vantage on events that ""really occurred"" throughout Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making activities, including the production of a textual reality of human rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of social problems."
1	In this article we develop and test a multi-level theory of the sources of self-control among adolescents. We argue that neighborhoods are an important structural source of self-control. We test this idea using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 9,171). Results from a multilevel structural equation model indicate that neighborhood disadvantage is a significant predictor of adolescent self-control, controlling for demographics, family characteristics, and social integration. Implications for future research on the role of neighborhood context in the development of self-control among youth are discussed. In addition, we discuss the implications for policy of multilevel theorizing.
0	Facebook and online subscription-based games have become increasingly prevalent aspects of college life and a notable alternative to face-to-face interaction between students.  In order to better understand the role these platforms play in college students' social support networks, we administered an online survey questionnaire testing three hypotheses: 1) Students with higher levels of offline social support have higher levels of social support from Facebook use. 2) Students with higher levels of offline social support have lower levels of social support from online game use. 3) Students with higher levels of Facebook avidity have higher levels of social support from Facebook use. The third hypothesis was the only hypothesis supported by the survey results.

0	This paper examines how the dual role of the federal government in promoting and regulating promising new industrial technologies may evolve to embody an inherent conflict of interest, a condition referred to as the “paradox of partnerships”.  Using a temporal analytic framework to further understand this seeming conflict, this research presents comparative case studies of two recent technologies – nuclear power and nanotechnology.  It concludes that while government-industry partnerships may seem relatively unproblematic during early phases of technological development, such partnerships could prove deeply problematic some years later.  These problems could undermine both the credibility of the technology as well as the effectiveness of subsequent regulatory efforts.  Applying lessons learned from the downfall of the nuclear power industry, it appears that as nanotechnology becomes technically and economically feasible, early “government investments” in the development of the technology may come to look more like “entanglements” in industrial activities that involve risks as well as rewards.  The damage, moreover, may prove difficult or impossible to undo.
0	We use data from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality to test hypotheses regarding patterns of ethnoracial and gender differences in wage returns to authority.  Several empirical conclusions are reached.  First, race/ethnicity and gender do affect the financial rewards that authority brings.  When transitioning from supervisory to managerial positions, black womens net wages are significantly increaseda pattern that is not observed among other groups.  Second, and consistent with recent authority studies based on diverse samples, authority explains very little of the wage gap between sub-groups (cp. England et al. 1999).  Third, there is no evidence that  group differences in wages increase with movement up the authority or occupational hierarchy. Instead, there is a fairly constant, double digit wage gap between white men and other groups within each level of authority.  Finally, there is partial support for the hypothesis that women and minorities receive lower returns than white men to their human capital investments at increasingly higher levels of power.  Our overall conclusion is very much consistent with that of  Wright & Perrone (1977:52): not only are women and minorities less likely to advance up authority hierarchies, but when they do, they are also rewarded less than their white male counterparts.
1	"Generalized trust has become a paramount topic throughout the social sciences, in its own right and as the key civic component of social capital. To date, cross-national research relies on the standard question: ""Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?"" Yet the radius problem-that is, how wide a circle of others respondents imagine as ""most people""-makes comparisons between individuals and countries problematic. Until now, much about the radius problem has been speculation, but data for 51 countries from the latest World Values Survey make it possible to estimate how wide the trust radius actually is. We do this by relating responses to the standard trust question to a new battery of items that measures in-group and out-group trust. In 41 out of 51 countries, ""most people"" in the standard question predominantly connotes out-groups. To this extent, it is a valid measure of general trust in others. Nevertheless, the radius of ""most people"" varies considerably across countries; it is substantially narrower in Confucian countries and wider in wealthy countries. Some country rankings on trust thus change dramatically when the standard question is replaced by a radius-adjusted trust score. In cross-country regressions, the radius of trust matters for civic attitudes and behaviors because the assumed civic nature of trust depends on a wide radius."
0	Although listing a child for sale in the local paper's classified section is unthinkable, and it is illegal to sell organs in the United States, there is a proliferation of advertisements recruiting young women and men to sell eggs and sperm. These advertisements are placed by organized donation programs whose paying clients use reproductive technologies to conceive children, thereby creating a 21st century medical market in genetic material. Eggs and sperm are symmetrical bodily goods, each constituting one half of the reproductive material needed to create life, which allows for a comparative analysis of the structure and experience of egg and sperm donation. This paper draws on interviews conducted with staff and donors at four programs in California to analyze gendered bodily commodification in egg and sperm donation.  I argue that if a reproductive cell's origin in a woman's body or a man's body determines its status as thing or person, product or service, commodity exchange or gift exchange, then these distinctions will shape the experiences of the women and men selling genetic material. This paper contributes to debates in the sociology of gender about the relationship between biological differences among women and men and the gendered norms attributed to these differences and debates in economic sociology about how social factors affect the expansion of the market.

While the research is grounded in the theoretical literature on the second generation immigrant experience, the study departs from that body of work by proposing the use of family experiences, gender and especially, autonomy in the analysis of the second generation experience.  While much of the literature on South Asians in the United States focuses on their maintainence or negotiation of ethnicity and tradition, this study uses a focus on dating and marriage strategies and choices to reveal the variability and autonomy in the second generation experience. Though the use of qualitative data from interviews and employing a life course approach emphasizing the subjective dimensions of life choices, three life pathways emerged, the traditional pathway, the independence pathway and the ethnic rebellion pathway, showing the complexity and variation of experiences.
1	"World polity research argues that modern states are shaped by embeddedness in a network of international organizations, and yet the structure of that network is rarely examined. This is surprising, given that world polity theory implies that the world polity should be an increasingly dense, even, flat field of association. This article describes the social structure of the world polity, using network analysis of the complete population of intergovernmental organizations as it has evolved since 1820. Analysis of the world polity's structure reveals growing fragmentation, driven by exclusive rather than universalist intergovernmental organizations. The world polity has thus grown less cohesive, more fragmented, more heterogeneous, and less ""small worldly"" in its structure. This structure reflects a recent rise in the regionalization of the world polity."

It is used to project how resources (transfers) and tax burdens associated with Social Security and other social programs will be distributed across generations (more precisely age cohorts) over a lifetime assuming no change in current policy. It is part of the broader literature on the generational equity as it shares the same goal of equalizing tax burdens and transfer benefits across generations. Our paper first describes the model and then reviews some of the major issues raised by its critics. We argue that the model’s attention to the importance of tax and spending policies promoting intergenerational equity fails to take into consideration potentially adverse consequences of policies with respect to intragenerational equity, that is, forms of equity based on within cohort differences based on income, gender, race, and age. We propose a reframed version of generational accounting that considers both intragenerational and intergenerational equity. Our reframing also makes room for efforts to factor in the benefits of spending on national parks and reducing greenhouse gas emission, that is, programs with profound consequences for future generations that defy measurement in terms of projected monetary benefits or relative age-cohort burdens.
1	To what extent does community context affect individuals' social ties and levels of community attachment? The authors replicate Sampson's multilevel version of Kasarda and Janowitz's systemic model of community using data from a survey of nearly 10,000 people residing in 99 small Iowa communities. They improve on Sampson's work by using multilevel statistical tools, better measurement of community attachment, and data from 99 actual communities. While the authors find general support for the systemic model, their results suggest that the community one lives in actually has little effect on one's level of community attachment, calling into question many of the basic assumptions and findings of past community research.
1	"What do sociologists mean when they describe culture as founded on ""shared understandings""? Sharing an understanding does not necessarily imply having the same opinions but rather agreeing on the structures of relevance and opposition that make symbols and actions meaningful. Because meaning is contextual, different people might interpret the same reality in different ways. Yet standard quantitative sociological methods are not designed to take such heterogeneity into account. In this article, I introduce a new method-relational class analysis-that uses attitudinal data to identify groups of individuals that share distinctive ways of understanding the same domain of social activity. To demonstrate its utility I use it to reexamine the cultural omnivore thesis. I find that Americans' understandings of the social symbolism of musical taste are shaped by three competing logics of cultural distinction, in a manner that complicates contemporary sociological accounts of artistic taste."
1	Empirical studies on cultural capital have never fully operationalized the concept using indicators of all three states distinguished by Bourdieu i e, institutionalized, embodied and objectified cultural capital We provide such a threefold measurement for both respondents and their parents in our analysis of the intergenerational transmission of cultural capital Respondents' schooling levels (institutionalized state) are affected by parental education and, to a lesser extent, parental cultural behavior, but both effects are smaller among younger generations Cultural participation (embodied state) is consistently affected by all three manifestations of parental cultural capital Possessing cultural goods (objectified state) is mostly affected by parents' cultural possessions Our results reveal that the three states of cultural capital differ in the constellation of their causes and consequences, plus the changes therein
1	Previous research suggests that higher incomes, safe workplaces, job security and healthcare access all contribute to favorable health. Reflecting the interest of economic and political sociologists in power relations and institutions, union membership has been linked with many such influences on health. Nevertheless, the potential relationship between union membership and health has received little attention. Using logistic regression and propensity score matching, this study examines the association between union membership and self-rated health generally and among select subgroups of the workforce with the General Social Survey from 1973 to 2006. Initial bivariate analyses suggest that union membership is actually associated with worse health. This association disappears when controlling for demographics, then reverses and becomes significant when controlling for labor market characteristics. In well-specified models, union membership has a significant positive effect on favorable self-rated health. The effect roughly offsets the effects of five years of aging or being divorced (as opposed to married). In addition, propensity score matching analyses demonstrate that union membership has a beneficial, significant average treatment effect for the treated. We show that much of union membership's effect in the overall sample is due to the mechanism of higher incomes, but that among men, the less educated, and those with lower incomes, the union-health advantage is not explained fully by income. The effect of union membership also appears to be stable over time. We conclude by encouraging further research on how power relations and institutions shape health.
1	Urban mass mobilization often stimulates the collapse of authoritarian regimes, but the literature on social forces in democratization has not dealt adequately with these episodes of popular protest. Nor has it systematically compared democratic revolutions with cases of authoritarian crackdown and chronic quiescence, despite the prevalence of these alternative outcomes. This article critiques the democratization literature's excessive focus on class actors and economic factors by highlighting the importance of emotive appeals to nationalist and religious sentiments and solidarities in sparking, sustaining, and sanctifying high-risk protest against authoritarian governments. A comparative historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries reveals that democratic uprisings are more likely both to emerge and to succeed when communal elites-a society's primary possessors of nationalist and religious authority-assume an oppositional posture. Explaining variation in mobilization outcomes thus requires examining whether communal elites have gained political salience and retained political autonomy through long-term processes of political development.
0	Based on systematic content analysis this paper presents a new approach, Theory Dimensions Analysis (TDA), to examine transformations in a scientific field and to identify theory structures that orient a scientific community. The exponentially growing field of social network research is investigated. Fourteen key theory dimensions of social relations that were of chief concern to classical sociological theorists such as Durkheim, Mead, Marx, Schutz, Simmel, and Weber are identified. A sample of articles (N=240) from the American Sociological Review and the American Journal of Sociology between the years 1964-2004 is analyzed. Despite the exponential growth of the field, its diffused nature, and allegations of lack of a theoretical orientation, the multidimensional analysis reveals a stable theoretical orientation across time.
0	This paper discusses the organizational culture of a new media firm in New York City which I will refer to as Community.com More specifically, it will look at spatial changes and layout, company meetings, social gatherings, organizational rituals, the community vs. market conflict, new business models and several levels of discourse. Discourse in this study will include several types such as digital, company, and industry. I will document the cultural changes which have occurred at Community.com from the time it was founded in 1997 through 2003. In this six year period I will demonstrate that the firm changed from a focus on community towards a more market based approach. I will be using ethnographic data from over a two year period to look at the cultural transformation which took place. This is part of a larger work which is an ethnography of Community.com over a two year period.
0	Maintaining network connectivity is essential for disaster response teams.  Such networks tend to be hub-dominated and therefore rely heavily on the most connected members of the network to disseminate information.  In the case of the response to the World Trade Center disaster of September 11th, 2001, the most connected members of disaster response teams were often actors in coordinative roles.  This paper examines the importance of these actors by simulating several systematic node failures.  The effect of node failures on network connectivity depends on the type of network—specialist or non-specialist—and who is being targeted — random actors, actors in coordinative roles, or high-degree actors.  Using robustness scores which I derive by simulating failure of these three types of actors, I compare robustness across networks to see which of these networks are most vulnerable to which types of node failures.  Furthermore, comparing the results of these failures across different measurements of connectivity—direct and mutual connectivity and isolate formation—yields information on how these failures dismantle these networks.  I find that specialist networks are most vulnerable to loss of high degree actors, who often tend to be those in coordinative roles.  Once those nodes fail, the remaining nodes tend to be isolated, without ties to the network.  On the contrary, non-specialist networks tend to remain relatively connected (and produce fewer isolates) when their coordinators are removed.  Both remain quite susceptible to degree-targeted failures.
1	In the early to mid-2000s, four flagship Israeli selective universities incorporated a need-blind and color-blind affirmative action policy into their admissions practices. The program, which gives an edge in admission to academically borderline applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds, emphasizes structural disadvantages, such as neighborhood socioeconomic status and high school rigor. The results of this study, based on administrative data from the four universities, demonstrate that having such a policy in place made the four institutions, especially the echelons at the most selective departments, more diverse than they otherwise would have been. The rise in geographic, economic and demographic diversity of a student population suggests that the plan's focus on structural determinants of disadvantage yields broad diversity dividends. The paper discusses the relevance of the findings to the ongoing discussion of admission regimes, diversity and equality of opportunity in the US. 
1	This study investigates the effect of the latest wave of economic globalization on manufacturing employment in developing countries. It revisits the classic debate on the effect of internal and external influences on industrialization, and extends this debate to contemporary developing countries. In the process, it assesses the evidence for development/productivity, world systems/dependency and globalization explanations, and uses a comprehensive dataset on 64 developing countries from 1980 through 2003. The results generally show that manufacturing employment increased in most developing countries. First, this study finds that the level of economic development measured by gross domestic product per capita is the most important factor influencing the size of manufacturing employment. Second, economic globalization also influences manufacturing employment in developing countries, but mainly through trade. The size of exports and low-technology exports have a significant positive effect on manufacturing employment in developing countries. Finally, the analysis provides limited support for world systems/dependency theories. Raw materials exports do not significantly influence manufacturing employment while foreign direct investment has a negative impact in some models. This study concludes that the latest wave of economic globalization contributed to the expansion of manufacturing employment in developing countries, although it is not the most significant factor shaping the size of manufacturing employment in these countries.
0	Opportunity is an extremely important determinant in sociological phenomena (Mayhew,1984). For example, friendship ties are highly unlikely to exist between two individuals on opposite sides of the globe or even between individuals in the same town with completely different interests. One of the most empirically supported effects of opportunity on social interaction and social ties is that of physical distance. Across many different fields and contexts physical distance has been shown to affect social structure (Butts, 2010). In this work we consider the effect of physical distance on a large-scale, social network of friendship ties between national universities in the U.S. We explore indicators of institution prestige as mediators in the relation between distance and social tie probability. In this work we employ spatial Bernoulli models to aid in characterizing the specific effects of distance and prestige on social ties between top ranked universities. Our work demonstrates that geographic distance affects social ties. In addition we find that institutional prestige differentially affects tie probabilities across large distances. Implications for research on higher education are also discussed.
1	Recent studies indicate that the growth of earnings inequality in the United States since the late 1970s reflects organizational changes in the process of earnings determination. Existing research primarily focuses on workplace changes that reduce earnings levels for middle- and low-wage workers despite the importance of high-wage gains for rising inequality. This paper investigates how organizational context affects the relationship between occupation and earnings, with a focus on high-wage occupations. The earnings associated with low-wage occupations do not vary across industry groups. By contrast, the earnings advantages associated with high-wage occupations vary across industry groups in relation to the industry's prevalence of performance pay practices. Pay initiatives that reward individuals for company performance explain much of the inter-industry variance in managerial and professional earnings slopes. The growth of performance-based pay represents an organizational change in earnings determination that may serve as a mechanism of high-wage earnings growth and rising inequality. 
1	"Constructionist theories suggest the national rise in female violence arrests may be policy generated because arrest statistics are produced by violent behavior and changing official responses (e. g., net-widening enforcement policies). Normative theories attribute the rise to female behavior changes (e. g., in response to increased freedoms or hardships). We examine whether any narrowing of the arrest gender gap is borne out across offense types of varying measurement reliability, in victimization data, and across two post-arrest criminal justice stages. Advanced time-series analyses over 1980 through 2003 support the constructionist position. First, all sources show little or no increase in women's rates for the more reliably measured offenses of homicide and robbery, and for rape. Second, the assault gender gap narrows for arrests, but holds stable in victimization data. And, third, the assault gender gap narrows moderately for convictions, but is stable for imprisonment, indicating spill-over effects of more expansive arrest policies. Several factors have produced greater female representation in ""criminal assault"" arrests including (1) proactive policing targeting and formally responding to minor violence and in private contexts, (2) interventionist developmental epistemologies that blur distinctions among violence types and circumstances, (3) the rise of social movements recognizing ""hidden"" victims, (4) law and order political messages stressing greater accountability, and (5) the somewhat greater decline in male compared to female violence in the late 1990s. The problem of women's violence is largely a social construction. Rather than women becoming more violent, changes in the management of violence increasingly mask differences in the violence levels of women and men."
0	When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in late August 2005, New Orleans residents were thrown into dangerous and uncertain situations.  Economically marginal individuals found themselves in vulnerable positions as they evacuated to new cities and eventually faced relocation.  Katrina survivors had an immediate need for basic necessities such as food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.  They also had a longer-term need for assistance in re-establishing themselves and rebuilding their lives.  This paper presents preliminary findings about the experiences survivors in Texas had with receiving assistance in the first months after the hurricane.  Survivors experiences of searching out and receiving assistance are examined in the context of the limited nature of the US welfare state.  Given the incompleteness of government assistance to low-income people, non-governmental organizations have become more important in the provision of social services.  The failure of FEMA has been widely noted, but not widely acknowledged as part of a larger problem of an inadequate social service system for the economically disadvantaged in this society.  Katrina was a unique occurrence in many respects, but it revealed some very commonplace social problems in the US.  The delays and confusion surrounding federal hurricane assistance forced survivors to depend heavily on assistance from other sources, though this assistance was not stable or long term.  Few respondents found assistance adequate or easy to access.  Although Katrina presented unique challenges to the government and social service agencies, it revealed everyday problems with social service delivery in the US.
1	This article examines employers' perceptions, attitudes, and preferences regarding native black and immigrant Latina/o workers in the Los Angeles hotel industry. We find that the employers in this industry almost universally prefer immigrant Latina/o workers over native blacks for entry-level, hotel maid jobs. Moreover, we find that employers stress soft skills (attitude, work ethic, interaction skills) to frame their hiring decisions for entry-level jobs when in fact these preferences appear to speak more to tractability. Thus, we caution researchers about the coded meanings of the soft skills concept and about uncritically classifying employer talk about attitudes, motivation, and work ethic as indicators of soft skills when these preferences appear to speak more to immigrant Latina/o vulnerabilities in shaping employer hiring decisions. Keywords: race, soft skills, immigrant Latino and native black workers, employer discrimination, hotel industry.
0	This research examines the significance of preexisting racial/ethnic composition on the likelihood of gentrification, the socioeconomic upgrading of poor neighborhoods.  I use U.S. Census data for tracts in Chicago from 1980 to 2000.  There is an extensive literature attempting to account for its causes, but it focuses almost exclusively on population and housing traits and locational attributes, largely omitting issues of race/ethnicity.  This omission is significant because prior housing preference literature consistently reports an unwillingness of whites to move into neighborhoods with even relatively small African American populations.  The absence of race/ethnicity in the gentrification literature appears to have led to an undervaluing of its role in this type of inner city change.  Using logistic regression, I measure the significance of the percent of non-Hispanic blacks in census tracts at risk of gentrification in 1980 on the odds of gentrification by 2000, while controlling for population and neighborhood characteristics as well as proximity variables.  I hypothesize that a large African-American population decreases the likelihood of gentrification.  In the initial analysis, the percent non-Hispanic black was not significant in the full model.  However, after removing the black gentrified tracts, the tracts upgraded by middle class African Americans, and running the same analyses again, the percent non-Hispanic black remains significant in each model.  I draw from these results that the size of the African American population influences a tract’s gentrification outcome.  Further, black gentrification is the most likely means for poor census tracts with large African-American populations to gentrify.
0	Using the most recent two waves from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), collected in 2002 and 2005, we test the longitudinal effects of childhood, adulthood, and community socioeconomic status (SES) on functional limitation, chronic conditions, cognitive impairment, self-rated health, and mortality people aged 65 or over in China.  We then examine psychosocial pathways linking SES to mortality and health in later life. Compared to childhood and community SES, adulthood SES is the primary determinant of various facets of health in older ages.  Childhood SES is only predictive of cognitive impairment.  Community SES affects both cognitive impairment and chronic illness.  The SES effects on chronic illness are intriguing, inconsistent with our hypotheses. These patterns can not be explained by social differentials in health practices previously hypothesized as a potential psychosocial pathway.  More studies are needed to further explore processes through which socioeconomic standings affect healthy aging in China.
1	Previous theory and research suggests that workplace gender composition at the highest organizational levels should play a crucial role in reducing gender linked inequalities in the workplace. In this article, we examine how the presence of women in top corporate positions influences female managerial representation at the establishment-level. Using a unique multi-level dataset of 5679 establishments nested within 81 Fortune 1000 corporations, we find that having more women on corporate boards, but not in executive positions, at the firm-level is associated with greater female managerial representation at the establishment-level. The results also show that women are more likely to be in management positions when employed in young, large, and managerially intensive workplaces, as well as those with a larger percentage of female non-managers. Implications for future research and policy implementation are discussed. 
0	Military coups have been quite common in the last half century and have made up roughly one fifth of leadership changes globally in the period from WWII to the collapse of the Soviet Union (Hanneman, 1986).  This research studies the political antecedents for regime change by successful military coup cross nationally during the time period between 1940 and 1984 in a sample of 934 regimes.  We examine the “types” of regimes that result in a high and low occurrence of military coups during the time period of the study.  The political traits used for the classification of regimes are measured at the nominal level and are indicators of military involvement in executive decision making and the practice of political pluralism.  The limitations imposed by the level of measurement of our variables has led us to a predictive classification approach developed by Charles Ragin based on Boolean mathematics.  We argue that a simple partial additive model is not necessarily the best approach to understanding the political antecedents of military coups, especially if our outcome variable is a function of joint occurrences rather than a combination of independently varying factors.  We find that certain combinations of traits, when co-present, differentially influence whether or not regimes are likely to result in military coups.
1	Much research examines the organizational changes brought by equal employment opportunity (EEO) law, but it remains unclear whether establishments formally charged with employment discrimination and found in violation of EEO laws actually improve workplace conditions for women and racial minorities. Building on economic and institutional accounts of organizational responses to legal intervention, this article assesses the effects of discrimination charges and their resolutions on changes in establishment-level occupational segregation by sex and race from 1990 to 2002. Using data from a national random sample of work establishments matched to discrimination charge data, I examine the direct impact of charges on workplaces, as well as the indirect pressures that establishments experience in their legal and organizational environments. For sex segregation, I find that establishments do not desegregate in the wake of discrimination charges filed directly against them, but they do respond to EEO enforcement in their industrial fields and legal environments. For race segregation, organizational factors-rather than legal intervention-are the primary predictors of desegregation. To the extent that EEO enforcement encourages organizational change, it does so indirectly operating through establishments' industrial and legal environments.
0	Secularisation theory, prominent in classical sociological accounts, saw the ebbing of religiosity concomitant with the growing prominence of scientific rationality.  While there is some evidence for this in some richer countries, religious values are still core to myths of the American nation.  In fact, research suggests that atheists are among the most despised groups in the United States. This paper uses qualitative data collected as part of a large scale social survey with over 8200 respondents to explore how those at the centre of rational and free thought, scientists and engineers, make sense of stigma they face as atheists.  We then examine this in the context of boundary-work between science and non-science and human rights discourses relevant to freedom of religion and speech.  This informs a larger research project that examines ways in which scientists and engineers reflect on their roles as social agents and citizens.
0	Although social movements are often referred to as a single entity, recent research has emphasized that social movements exist within multi-organizational fields. Even among allies, social movement organizations have different frames and goals often leading to frame disputes (Benford 1993).  These disputes may occur in a variety of arenas and each organization may affect the others frames and success at achieving their goals. This research examines the case of pro-life pharmacists who refusals to fill birth control prescriptions and conscience clause legislation designed to protect them. I analyze frame disputes between pro-life allies in three arenas: the social movement sector, mass media, and state legislatures. Preliminary analyses reveal that frame disputes occur because of divided loyalties, misinterpretation of frames, definitional differences and divided loyalties. Frames change in response to the issue being framed, the sponsor of the frame, and the success of the frame. This research provides insight into the role of media in social movement framing and the relationship between social movement allies in various positions of power.
1	This article investigates structural sources of earnings losses in the U.S. labor market, analyzing data from the Outgoing Rotation Groups and Displaced Worker Supplements of the 2003 2008 Current Populations Survey. After introducing the data and methodology, a descriptive model of inter-industry earnings differentials in the full labor market between 2003 and 2008 is presented to motivate a baseline claim that industry of employment represents a salient partition of the distribution of good and bad jobs over this time period. Then, the current wages of two groups of workers in 2006 and 2008, who were displaced from their jobs in the prior 3 years, are modeled. Earnings losses of re-employed workers are analyzed, conditional on re-employment in alternative industries, while simultaneously adjusting for observed determinants of selection into employment. The findings demonstrate that displaced workers who are then re-employed suffer from earnings losses in their new jobs. These losses are larger among those who switch industries, especially among those who move to traditional low-wage industries in the service sector. The losses are also larger for those who held their prior jobs for 3 or more years, and they cannot be explained away by differences in the skill requirements between the jobs from which individuals are displaced and those in which they are re-employed. The findings are discussed with reference to structural theories of labor market inequality from sociology and economics, which represent valuable complementary perspectives to individualistic skill-based accounts of earnings differences. 
1	Using international data on educational achievement among 15-year-olds in 20 OECD countries, I compare the effect of sibship size on reading literacy and link the cross-national variation in the sibship-size effect to differences in national contexts of public policies for families and children. Comparisons highlight significant cross-national variation in the level of public policies, even among countries ordinarily thought to belong to the same welfare regime. Deviating from previous literature that focused on overall differences across welfare regimes, I explore the way in which specific public policy variables, rather than categorical regimes, mediate the relationship between sibship size and educational achievement. The results of two-level hierarchical linear models show that countries with stronger public support for childcare, universal child benefits, larger public expenditures on education and family, show a much less negative effect of growing up in large families. Moreover, these policy variables explain a large part of the better performance of social democratic countries in reducing the negative effect of sibship size. 
1	This article extends research on the consequences of parental incarceration for child well-being, the effects of mass imprisonment on black-white inequalities in child well-being, and the factors shaping black-white inequalities in infant mortality by considering the relationship between imprisonment and infant mortality, using individual- and state-level data from the United States, 1990 through 2003. Results using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) show that parental incarceration is associated with elevated early infant mortality risk and that partner violence moderates this relationship. Infants of recently incarcerated fathers who are not abusive have twice the mortality risk of other infants, but there is no association if the father was abusive. Results from state-level analyses show a positive association between the imprisonment rate and the total infant mortality rate, black infant mortality rate, and black-white inequality in the infant mortality rate. Assuming a causal effect, results show that had the imprisonment rate remained at its 1990 level, the 2003 infant mortality rate would have been 3.9 percent lower, black-white inequality in the infant mortality rate 8.8 percent lower. Thus, results imply that imprisonment may have health consequences that extend beyond ever-imprisoned men to their social correlates and that these health spillover effects are not limited to infectious disease.
1	In this paper, we present results from measuring physical disorder in Los Angeles neighborhoods. Disorder measures came from structured observations conducted by trained field interviewers. We examine inter-rater reliability of disorder measures in depth. We assess the effects of observation conditions on the reliability of reporting. Finally, we examine the relationships between disorder, other indicators of neighborhood status, and selected individual outcomes.
1	Although AIDS is a leading cause of death worldwide, the consequences of the pandemic are remarkably unequally distributed cross-nationally. This unequal global distribution of AIDS deaths should be of interest to sociologists because of the potential role of structural forces in accounting for these disparities. Yet, there has been relatively little sociological research on this topic. Using underutilized cross-national data on AIDS deaths, this study examines the macro-level sources of variation in AIDS death rates across 115 countries. The analysis focuses on secondary school enrollment as a key structural factor in reducing AIDS deaths. After controlling for the prevalence of HIV infection, secondary school enrollment has the second largest and most robust effect on AIDS death rates. Economic development also reduces AIDS death rates, but this effect is mediated by secondary school enrollment. Schooling matters partly because it reduces HIV prevalence, but education still continues to have a significant negative effect on AIDS deaths even after controlling for prevalence. The education effect is robust in a variety of sensitivity analyses. Ultimately, this study underscores the role of structural factors, particularly education, for understanding the AIDS crisis.
0	Utilizing panel data from the 1992-1994 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the present study analyzes the effect of HRS respondents marital transitions on inter-vivos transfers to their adult children. In the paper, (1) We explore how both individual-and family-level variables mediate the effect of marital status transitions on intergenerational transfers; (2) we place special emphasis on tracking the array of transfers between parents and any number of adult children; and we assess whether or not there are gender differences in the observed patterns of relationships.
0	In this study, I examine the influence of macro-level context on network use in job search. I conduct a hierarchical regression analysis with crossed random effects on a unique data set that combines individual job history data for years 1985 through 2001 collected by the Survey of Social Dynamics and Migration in Russia (SSMDR) in 40 regions in 2001-2002 and corresponding regional macro-economic data by Goskomstat. I test three approaches that explain an increase in the use of personal ties in Russia since the market reforms began: Soviet legacy, institutional vacuum, and “social capitalism” approach. I find that, for the post-Soviet period, increase in network use in job search can be attributed to the growth of the private sector: Russian employers are becoming “social capitalists” who take advantage of the resources personal connections can offer such as cutting hiring costs, getting a better pool of potential workers, and getting in-depth information on workers’ qualifications.
1	"Many youth in the United States lack clear occupational aspirations. This uncertainty in achievement ambitions may benefit socio-economic attainment if it signifies ""role exploration,"" characterized by career development, continued education and enduring partnerships. By contrast, uncertainty may diminish attainment if it instead leads to ""aimlessness,"" involving prolonged education without the acquisition of a degree, residential dependence and frequent job changes. We use nationally representative data from the National Education Longitudinal Study to examine how uncertainty in occupational aspirations in adolescence (age 16) affects wage attainments in young adulthood (age 26). Results suggest that youth with undecided career ambitions earn significantly lower hourly wages in young adulthood than youth with more certain aspirations, supporting the view that uncertainty heightens the risk of labor-market problems."
0	In this paper, I examine class, gender, and ethnicity in the work relationships between Mexican domestic workers and Mexican American employers living along the Texas-Mexico border. I draw upon theories of symbolic boundaries and metaphoric borders to analyze the production of difference and how it is negotiated between these co-ethnic women. In order to examine the symbolic boundaries that are produced by employers and domestics, I analyze the management of food and meals in employers homes. The topic of food serves as a lens to understand the social hierarchies that exist in these relationships. I find that although both groups create symbolic boundaries, these productions are materially different. Employers use their control over material resources to mark and maintain class, ethnic, and gendered differences, while domestics, who lack this control, use a different material practice by crossing and creating borders and boundaries of femininity and ethnicity as it relates to the authentic Mexican woman.
0	The process of gender role socialization begins at birth the world over. From early childhood, boys and girls alike learn different sets of expectations, responsibilities, and personal attributes that males and females should respectively aspire to. Even the roles and expectations surrounding gendered relationships in adulthood and marriage are tied to notions of masculinity that are learned over the life course. In-depth interviews with 28 boys aged 12-15 in two hinterland towns in Ghana reveal the prospective notions these adolescents have already formed. Even at this early age, the data demonstrate a clear recognition of the male authority that marriage conveys. We explore the spectrum of gender roles in dating and marriage relationships as conceptualized by male youth, and examine the shift in power dynamics that occurs between dating and marriage. Relating their prospective expectations of gender relationships affirms the role of marriage in cementing patriarchy in this society. The evidence is quite convincing that gender inequality intensifies as dating relationships become marriages; men garner greater control of their wives through bridewealth payments and traditional husband/wife roles. The data provide some insights into the cultural bases of the power inequities in marriage. We discuss the implications for gender equity in the future.

By empirically distinguishing between general cognitive ability and work-specific cognitive ability, we show that the cognitive component of schooling is larger than anticipated by Bowles and Gintis (2000; 2002). Instead of around 20 percent of the education effect being cognitive, our results indicate that between 23 and 53 percent of the education effect is cognitive, depending on the country and operationalization of cognitive skills. Moreover, it was shown that the relative importance of general versus work-specific cognitive abilities varies systematically between countries, with a larger fraction of the schooling effect being captured by the work-specific component in Germany and the Netherlands than in the US and the UK. This is explained by the different role of schooling between countries. Importantly, controlling for allocative processes related to the industry, organization and occupation of employment was particularly relevant in Germany, which supports the notion that this country is most credentialized
1	We propose that social capital, defined as resources embedded in individual and organizational networks, produces expressive and instrumental civic actions. The 2000 Social Capital Benchmark Survey data were used to examine the hypothesis. Structural equation modeling confirmed that (1) individual social capital was the consistent and significant predictor of both expressive and instrumental civic actions; (2) organizational social capital played the most important role in predicting instrumental civic actions, although it was not significant in predicting expressive civic actions; and (3) civic actions are gendered: women were more likely to be involved in expressive civic actions, but the female dominance disappeared in the realm of instrumental civic actions.

1	Numerous studies have shown the importance of incentives as well as of attitudes in explaining pro-environmental behavior. Reported attitude effects, however, are generally rather small and exhibit considerable variation among studies. Different theoretical perspectives can account for this finding: whereas theories of rational action suggest additive effects of costs and attitudes, the low-cost hypothesis and dual-process theories imply interaction effects - in different directions, resulting from different mechanisms. The present study tries to overcome the shortcomings of past research by using advanced statistical methods to test competitive hypotheses in the context of post-consumer waste recycling. We utilize data from a natural experiment on recycling participation in Cologne/Germany (n = 1882) in which the incentive structure for recycling changed due to the conversion of the recycling scheme from a drop-off system to curbside collection. In order to avoid self-selection bias, we conducted pre- and post-treatment surveys and applied conditional fixed-effects regression models. We found that curbside collection had a strong impact on recycling participation and attitudes had a moderate effect. The interaction is negative but statistically insignificant. Our findings contradict the low-cost hypothesis and provide some evidence that environmental concerns moderate the effect of the recycling scheme. We cannot, however, reject the rational choice proposition of mere additive effects. 
0	The abstinence, be faithful and condom use (ABC) approach for HIV/AIDS prevention is criticized for its lack of gender sensitiveness. Gender inequality in heterosexual relationships is increasingly being cited as an important determinant of the higher rate of HIV infection among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a population-based survey of 1418 women aged 20 to 44 in Moshi Urban District (Moshi) in northern Tanzania, this study examined the hypothesis that gender inequality (violence at first intercourse, lifetime physical violence, couples age difference and partners financial contribution) elevates womens HIV risk even after adjustment for other risk behaviors. Women had increased risk of HIV-1 infection if their partners were at least ten years older, or their partners made low financial contributions to the household, after controlling for risk behaviors and background characteristics. The effect of forced first intercourse on HIV-1 infection was explained away by inequalities in current relationship and other risk behaviors, while lifetime physical violence was not associated with HIV-1 infection. This study provided further evidence that the womens subordination in sexual relationships in sub-Saharan Africa increases the spread of HIV among women. Thus, addressing gender inequality should be given higher priority in HIV prevention programs.
1	By investigating the intergenerational consequences of multiple aspects of family experiences across the life course this paper advances what we know about the forces shaping children's initiation of sexual and contraceptive behaviors. Our aim is to advance the scientific understanding of early sexual experiences by explicitly considering contraceptive use and by differentiating between the consequences of parental family experiences during Childhood and those during adolescence and young adulthood. Thanks to unique, highly detailed data measuring parental family experiences throughout the life course and sexual dynamics early in life it is possible to provide detailed empirical estimates of the relationship between parental family experiences and contraceptive use at first sex a relationship about which we know relatively little. Findings reveal (1) significant simultaneous consequences of many different dimensions of parental family experiences for the timing of first sex and the likelihood of using contraception at first sex, but the specific dimensions of family important for the specific behavior vary across racial groups: and (2) that parental family experiences influence the timing of sex and contraceptive use differently. 
1	The role played by parental wealth in facilitating the life chances and living standards of offspring is a topic of growing interest in stratification research. For working and middle class households much of their intervivos transfers to children is provided in the form of assistance with a home purchase. This paper examines the impact of parental wealth and transfers of wealth on several aspects of the homeownership decision - the timing of the purchase, the cost of the home, and the downpayment proportion, as well as living standards subsequent to the purchase. We utilize a unique data set from France which contains information on parental wealth and wealth transfers from both sets of parents of a couple. We correct for possible endogeneity of parental transfers and model the joint determination of the downpayment proportion and home value. The results make clear the complex pathways by which parental wealth influences the tenancy arrangements and living standards of offspring.

The California and French wine industries have different wine regulations and classification systems.  The California wines are classified by both appellation and grape varietal, while the French wines are mainly classified by appellation.  Compared with the California wine regulation system, the French wine regulation system is more hierarchical and rigid.  Under different institutional regulations and classifications, different factors affect wine reputations.  Based on analysis of original data sets consisting of wines from 64 California wineries and from 54 French wineries, we find quality factors can explain more variance in reputation among California wines, while appellation status is more crucial to a reputation among French wines.  Compared with California wineries, French wineries are more differentiated and French wineries exert more important impacts on wine reputation.  These findings demonstrate that even comparable industries or markets can be constructed very differently.  Different institutional arrangements such as regulation and classification systems have important consequences in affecting the identity and reputation of products as well as of organizations.
0	Theories of crime trends during modernization have typically conceptualized crimes as violent crimes versus property crimes. Based on this dominant conceptualization, Durkheimian perspectives have established their explanations about crime patterns during modernization and development processes.  However, this conceptualization may not have best captured all the essence of crime trend during rapid social change and modernization process.  Using annual statistics from the Chinese police and Procuratorate, this study examines a different conceptualization of crimes as economically motivated crimes verses non-economically motivated crimes based on the economic motivation thesis. The analysis of these data provide supportive evidence that the new conceptualization reflects important nature of crime trend process during Chinas rapid modernization process.
0	This paper examines the social and historical significance of coerced drug treatment within the criminal justice system.  Drug Courts, the most prominent example of this approach, serve as a case study to explore how seemingly contradictory perspectives on substance use  therapeutic and punitive  are merged to justify increased criminal justice oversight of defendants.  Drawing on an analysis of drug court organizational documents and interviews with key advocates, this paper (1) examines the punitive, therapeutic and medical knowledge drug court advocates draw upon and construct to justify an increased role for the courts in solving the problem of addiction, and (2) links these theories historically to broader discussions about the causes of crime and the role of the courts in solving social problems.  Overall, this paper considers how scientific theories are fused with moral considerations in the name of an enlightened criminal justice approach to complex social problems.
1	This paper examines stratification of opportunities in college access and completion. Using propensity score methods, we investigate two comparisons: (1) four- versus two-year public colleges and (2) private versus public two-year colleges. While previous research finds lower degree completion in two-year than in four-year public colleges, the comparability of students is doubtful. This paper re-considers the public four-year college effect, but for similar students and additional relevant outcomes. The second comparison is a new one. Though recruiting similar students as public two-year colleges, private two-year colleges use different organizational procedures, and we find that they have a different impact on comparable students' degree completion. We speculate about the reasons for these differences and whether they suggest potential benefits of adapting these procedures for public two-year colleges. 
0	In this paper we suggest that strategic turns in the uses of cultural theories reflect the exploration of ontological, epistemological, and methodological alternatives. In addition, these strategic turns in the uses of cultural theories are aimed to meet the current challenges influenced by changing cultures and their diverse perceptions faced by the increasing number of qualitative researchers. The goal of description that has characterized one end of ethnographical continuum such as traditional ethnography is replaced by the goal of manipulation as exemplified in more contemporary forms of ethnography such as critical ethnography. Instead of viewing culture as descriptive object, contemporary ethnographers produce disrupted ethnographies that manipulate the cultural object. In this paper we draw particular attention to two forms of disrupted ethnography and types of manipulation: critical and deconstructive. Last, we put forward a discussion of what ethnography is, suggesting that it may serve as an ambiguous, but highly legitimate label to doing a variety of epistemologically and theoretically different qualitative research. We also delineate our responses to the possibilities of disrupted ethnography and discuss how the strategic turn in the cultural studies shape and influence the field of qualitative research.

1	In the late 1990s, the British anti-genetic engineering (GE) movement effectively closed Britain's market for genetically modified foods, while the U. S. anti-GE movement had a negligible impact. In seeking to explain the different outcomes of these similar social movements, the authors draw upon the global commodity chains (GCC) literature to extend the understanding of the economic and industry-related openings and closures social movements face as they seek to promote social change. This analysis not only illustrates the importance of economic structures and organization for movement outcomes, but also shows how the economic sphere is culturally constituted. In this fashion, it broadens the social movement literature's understanding both of the way that political economy matters to movement efficacy and of the way that cultural processes infuse the economic sphere. The study advances the GCC literature by showing how GCCs are cultural as well as economic constructs.
1	This research examines how homeowners and renters were impacted by the financial crisis in 2009. We build from the hypothesis that homeownership provides people a sense of stability which decreases the extent to which they feel stressed as a result of financial hardship. Our study tests whether owning a home affected either the degree to which lower-income households experienced financial hardship or the extent to which they perceived they were financially stressed. Using a sample of lower-income borrowers who obtained affordable mortgages through the Community Advantage Program 
1	We use the 2003 National Survey of College Graduates to investigate earnings differentials between white and Asian American men. We extend prior literature by disaggregating Asian Americans by their immigration status in relation to the U.S. educational system, and by accounting for the effects of field of study and college type. Net of the latter variables and other demographic controls, native-born Asian American men have 8 percent lower earnings than do measurably comparable white men. Our findings show that Asian American men who were schooled entirely overseas have substantial earnings disadvantages, while Asian American men who obtained their highest degree in the United States but completed high school overseas have an intermediate earnings disadvantage. Net of the control variables, including region of residence, only 1.5-generation Asian American men appear to have reached full parity with whites. Most Asian American men lag at least slightly behind white men in terms of full equality in the labor market net of the measured covariates in our statistical models. No one theoretical approach seems able to explain our findings; instead, we suggest the relevance of several perspectives, including the racialized hierarchy view, the demographic heterogeneity approach, and assimilation theory.
0	In the global era marked by cosmopolitanism and the denationalization of internal societies, the normative dimensions of citizenship have taken precedence over the juridical status of citizenship.  Using the new British Citizenship Tests and Citizenship Ceremonies as a case study, this paper details the properties of the deontological ethics of symbolic citizenship.  The deontological properties of symbolic UK citizenship deracialized idealized or “symbolic citizenship” through language, history, obligations to belong, and embodied performances on how to perform citizenship duties that indicates whether one deserves their rights. In place of race and nationality is the importance of optimizing good citizen practices that demands visibility – seen and heard rather than national ideals of invisibility – segregation and containment.  Since belonging is achieved on the local level, the consequences for citizenship and the state is the increased emphasis of ‘culture’ that supersedes the legal definition of citizenship and subsequent increase of local power.
0	How can we understand the persistence of race and gender inequality in light of legal mandates designed to eliminate it nearly a half-century ago? This study develops and tests a theory for understanding how micro-level expressions of resistance and ambivalence to laws aimed at reducing inequality (e.g., affirmative action, sexual harassment law, racial integration mandates) allow for and sometimes reinforce macro-level inequality. Because inequalities between social groups are expressed and enacted through the interactions of individuals, I investigate individual-level resistance to show that societal change is slowed when widespread cultural beliefs, privileges, and norms of interaction are at stake. To test the theory, I analyze the social psychological mechanisms which drive resistance to race-based affirmative action using secondary survey data from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality (MCSUI). Analyses reveal that cultural status beliefs advantaging whites, threats to group interest, and threats to norms of social interaction drive resistance to affirmative action among groups who are not the targets of the policy. For those who stand to gain from the policy, cultural status beliefs advantaging whites and concerns about the disempowering effect of the law drive resistance to affirmative action. These findings have important implications for understanding the persistence of inequality more generally, and should inform policymakers on ways to implement and disseminate equalizing laws in ways that counter resistance and backlash.
1	This study assesses the trends and differentials in length of quality life in the U.S. population as measured by happy life expectancy in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. The analysis combines age-specific prevalence rates of subjective well-being from a large nationally representative survey and life table estimates of mortality in decennial Census years. Employing the period prevalence-rate life table method-Sullivan method, the analysis finds evidence for improvement in quality of life in the U.S. Happy life expectancy largely increased in both absolute terms (number of years) and relative terms (proportion of life) over time at all adult ages examined. And increases in total life expectancy were mainly contributed by increases in expectancy in happy years rather than unhappy years. Happy life expectancy is longer than active life expectancy. And there has been greater compression of unhappiness than compression of morbidity. There are substantial differentials in happy life expectancy by sex and race because of differential prevalence rates of happiness. Women and whites had longer years of total and happy life expectancies at most ages and dates, while men and blacks had greater proportions of happy life expectancies across the three decades. Although race differentials generally decreased at older ages and with time, relative disadvantages of blacks persisted. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	Building on prior work surrounding negative workplace experiences, such as bullying and sexual harassment, we examine the extent to which organizational context is meaningful for the subjective experience of sex discrimination. Data draw on the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce, which provides a key indicator of individuals' sex discrimination experiences as well as arguably influential dimensions of organizational context-i.e., sex composition, workplace culture and relative power-suggested by prior research. Results indicate that the experience of sex discrimination is reduced for both women and men when they are part of the numerical majority of their work group. Although supportive workplace cultures mitigate the likelihood of sex discrimination, relative power in the workplace seems to matter little. We conclude by revisiting these results relative to perspectives surrounding hierarchy maintenance, group competition and internal cultural dynamics.
0	This paper examines the experience of the Zapatista insurgency in Southeastern Mexico. Doing so, it demonstrates how the tactics and institutional frameworks of the Zapatistas constitute an example of a feasible utopian project. Through distancing themselves from the old revolutionary paradigms by asserting an anti-power stance alongside a rejection of fixed goals, the Zapatistas have not only contributed to the theorization of a new utopianism but also manages to shift the imaginative to the formative. The strength of the Zapatista experience lies in its capability to create an institutional framework which allow a constant questioning of the present; thus preventing stagnating closures in the name of a correct ideology. The amalgamation of the imaginative and the practical into an ongoing struggle renders the Zapatistas into a revolution-in-motion where utopian spaces of dialogical politics are preserved to maintain the motion whilst utopian spaces as alternative forms of governance and development are built.
1	"The term ""second shift"" from Hochschild's (1989) classic volume is commonly used by scholars to mean that employed mothers face an unequal load of household labor and thus a ""double day"" of work. We use two representative samples of contemporary U.S. parents with preschoolers to test how mothers employed fulltime and married to a full-time worker (Focal mothers) differ in time allocations and pressures from fathers and from mothers employed parttime or not at all. Results indicate focal mothers' total workloads are greater than fathers' by a week-and-a-half, not an ""extra month"" per year. Focal mothers have less leisure, but do not experience more onerous types of unpaid work, nor get less sleep than fathers. Focal mothers feel greater time pressures compared with fathers; however, some of these tensions extend to other mothers of young children. Finally, these families may be engaged in fewer quality activities with children compared with families where mothers are not employed fulltime."
0	The availability of data on cohabiting unions in the United States has lagged behind the growth in cohabitation: Although the prevalence of cohabiting unions in the United States increased rapidly starting in the 1970s, complete data on cohabitation was not collected by nationally representative surveys until the late 1980s.  Retrospective data from these surveys could be used to reconstruct patterns of cohabitation in the 1970s, but the reliability of cohabitation histories has not yet been established.  In this paper, we assess the quality of retrospective data on cohabitation by comparing data collected by four major U.S. family surveys, the National Survey of Families and Households and three rounds of the National Survey of Family Growth.  We use event history analysis to analyze rates of entry into cohabitation in age-period-cohort segments captured by multiple surveys.  We find consistent discrepancies between the four surveys.  The pattern of differences suggests that cohabitation histories underestimate cohabitation rates in distant periods relative to rates estimated closer to the date of survey; we conclude with cautions regarding the use of retrospective data on cohabitation when recall periods extend beyond five years.
1	Formal organizations share a common set of characteristics that Include identifiable operating principles and coordinating mechanisms as well as lines of authority and communication However, some organizations especially those on the margins of institutional fields creatively combine institutional and anti-institutional characteristics This tendency, which I call organizational liminality, represents a way in which certain groups resist the isomorphic tendencies of modern organizational life By comparing a group called The Fellowship, a religious organization of national and world leaders, with peer organizations, I show how formalized liminality is an intentional organizational strategy and discuss how this produces unique resources and liabilities for the group
0	Immigrant threat often is framed by anti-immigration organizations, politicians, the media, and neoconservative academicians as an explicitly Hispanic challenge, which left uncontrolled will lead to a widespread decline of the Anglo Protestant core of American society.  In this paper we analyze the subscription among the American public to this Hispanic Challenge Thesis (HCT) and examine its influence on attitudes toward immigration, considering support for restrictionism and multicultural policy attitudes.  Using data from the 2000 General Social Survey we establish a clear pattern of widespread endorsement of this thesis by the American public.  Our findings establish a strong link between adherence to HCT beliefs and restrictionist sentiment, and a moderate and somewhat more complicated link to multicultural policy attitudes.  Our results highlight the importance of attending to the influence of supra-individual factors -- such as the media, education and political elites -- to understanding anti-immigration attitudes.  We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our research for development of immigration-related policy and recommendations for further research building on our current study.
0	Using data from three U.S. census waves, we assess differences in earnings among Male and Female persons of African origins (African-Americans, African, and Caribbean immigrants) in the United States both cross-sectionally and over time. Results of the analysis suggest that African-American males earn less than their immigrant counterparts from the Caribbean, all things being equal, but earn about the same as immigrants from Africa. This finding was especially strong in the 1990 census and less so in the 1980 or 2000 waves. For females, the pattern is essentially the same. We also examined different indicators of Human Capital.  Our results indicate that earning a college degree from a foreign university prior to immigration led to a severe reduction in earnings; however, this penalty seems to have lessened over the period of study.  We discuss these findings in the context of the continuing debate on the significance of race, gender, and migration status on socioeconomic attainment in contemporary U.S. society.
1	Most sociological theories consider murder an outcome of the differential distribution of individual, neighborhood, or social characteristics. And while such studies explain variation in aggregate homicide rates, they do not explain the social order of murder, that is, who kills whom, when, where, and for what reason. This article argues that gang murder is best understood not by searching for its individual determinants but by examining the social networks of action and reaction that create it. In short, the social structure of gang murder is defined by the manner in which social networks are constructed and by people's placement in them. The author uses a network approach and incident-level homicide records to recreate and analyze the structure of gang murders in Chicago. Findings demonstrate that individual murders between gangs create an institutionalized network of group conflict, net of any individual's participation or motive. Within this network, murders spread through an epidemic-like process of social contagion as gangs evaluate the highly visible actions of others in their local networks and negotiate dominance considerations that arise during violent incidents.
1	Stereotype threat theory has gained experimental and survey-based support in helping explain the academic underperformance of minority students at selective colleges and universities Stereotype threat theory states that minority students underperform because of pressures created by negative stereotypes about their racial group Past survey-based studies however are characterized by methodological inefficiencies and potential biases key theoretical constructs have only been measured using summed indicators and predicted relationships modeled using ordinary least squares Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshman this study overcomes previous methodological shortcomings by developing a latent construct model of stereotype threat Theoretical constructs and equations are estimated simultaneously from multiple indicators, yielding a more reliable valid and parsimonious test of key propositions Findings additionally support the view that social stigma can indeed have strong negative effects on the academic performance of pejoratively stereotyped racial-minority group members not only in laboratory settings, but also in the real world 
1	We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home, the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show that World War II mobilization played an important role. First, Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered significantly greater losses where both non-white population and aircraft manufacturing employment increased. Our findings corroborate accounts of the social welfare state that stress partisan control and path dependence. Conservative congresses of the immediate postwar years left an imposing legacy, making it difficult to establish social welfare reforms for decades to come. Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States.
0	"Feminist sociologists have long challenged and expanded mainstream definitions of work. More recently, sociologists of the body have raised awareness of the body as a social field upon which power relations are acted out. Our paper unites these two trends in an attempt to make explicit and critically analyze the invisible work women often do with their own and others' bodies on the job. Using in-depth interviews with women office workers at a heterosexual men's pornographic magazine, we highlight the ""body work"" and ""embodied work"" they engage in on a daily basis. First, we examine the discursive strategies these workers use to turn images of women's bodies into mere products as a way of distancing themselves from the nude models (""body work""). Then we explore how these same workers manage their own bodies, as they carefully negotiate a professional identity in a workplace replete with hyper-sexualized images of other women's bodies (""embodied work""). We conclude by suggesting that our case, rather than being somehow unique because of the sexual content of the job, is merely an extreme example of two types of body work which are likely practiced in other, more ordinary locations."
0	This paper presents findings from our ongoing research on the pro-immigrant student walkouts in March of 2006. Drawing on 30 in-depth interviews with students, educators, and community activists involved in half a dozen walkouts across four Texas cities, we reconstruct students actions and experiences just before, during, and after the walkouts. In our reconstruction of the events, we highlight four interrelated social and psychological processes that have a long, if checkered, history in the sociology of collective behavior and social movements: 1) the role of anxiety as a collective mood shaping protests; 2) the centrality of non-normative or rule-breaking collective action; 3) the spontaneous, undirected, and fluid nature of the protests; and 4) the symbolic and emotional significance of the walkouts to the students involved. These themes recall insights from the collective behavior tradition and support more recent calls by scholars to resist normalizing protest and to attend to the role of emotions and ambiguity in social protest.
0	The paper outlines the development of the sociology of race and racism primarily within British sociology.  It problematizes some of the earlier race relations approaches (Banton 1977; Park 1950; Patterson 1963; Rex 1970; Zubaida 1970) by a careful examination of the writings of more critical, neo-Marxist and post/colonial accounts. In particular the paper compares and contrasts the work of British sociologists Robert Miles (1989; 1993; 1994a) and Paul Gilroy (1987; 1993a; 2000) who have produced some of the most theoretically suggestive bodies of work on the nature of contemporary racisms.  Their work raises central questions for sociology concerning the ontology of race, the nature of racism and the future for anti-racist struggle.
1	This study builds on political mediation and movement infrastructure models to highlight contingent and synergistic ways in which social movements may impinge upon the U S. national policy-making process. Analyses employ a variety of datasets to examine the role of environmental movement organizational capacity, protest and institutional activity in garnering Congressional attention to, and action on, salient issues from 1961 through 1990 We find all types of movement activity, but especially the development of national organizational infrastructures, to be positively associated with the convening of Congressional hearings on the environment. Only when there are high levels of both protest and institutional activity is there any evidence that the environmental movement directly influences the passage of environmental laws.
1	The authors use employment histories from survey data to examine personal network use and stratification in the Russian labor market from 1985 to 2001. Institutional changes associated with the Soviet collapse increased the use of networks and shaped their prevalence and benefits in theoretically coherent ways. In Russia, networks positively affect job quality, whether measured by occupation, current earnings, or wage arrears. These findings relate to recent debates over whether job contacts provide advantages and how social capital relates to postsocialist inequalities involving gender, Communist Party membership, and education. Russia also exhibits a previously overlooked relationship between network use and locality type.
1	"Through an interpretation of ethnographies of four very different religious communities, the author argues that there is a deep cultural commonality underlying the diversity of religious expression among the American middle classes. This commonality can be described in terms of religious individualism. But unlike previous accounts of religious individualism, this article emphasizes the ways in which it combines both ""seeking"" and ""dwelling"" and leads to both ""progressive"" and ""orthodox"" forms of religious expression."
1	Investigations of the reception of textual objects have alternately emphasized demographically conditioned patterns of evaluation and taste, or the agency of viewers, readers, and listeners in constructing their own cultural interpretations. In the present article, we advance an empirical and formal analysis of the cultural reception of texts in which interpretations of the multiple dimensions on which a text may be evaluated are transmitted and modified within small groups of individuals in face-to-face contact. We contribute an approach in which the intersection of social structure, individual readings, and interactive group processes all may enter into readers' interpretations of a novel. Our investigation focuses on a set of book clubs for which we collected data on group members' pre- and post-discussion evaluations of a specific book, and the interpersonal influence networks that were formed during the groups' discussions. We analyze these data with a multilevel model of individuals nested in groups, which allows us to address the effects of structure and group dynamics on cultural reception in a single analytic framework.
1	Previous quantitative research on environmental Justice has been limited by simplistic assumptions used to measure health risks and traditional regression techniques that fail to discern spatial variations in statistical relationships We address these gaps through a case study that examines (a) whether potential health risks from exposure to hazardous air pollutants in Florida are related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status and (b) how the significance of statistical associations between health risk and race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status vary across the state This study integrates census tract level estimates of cumulative cancer risk compiled by the EPA with Census 2000 data and a spatial statistical technique known as geographically weighted regression that allows us to explore spatial variability in analytical results Our findings indicate that while race and ethnicity are significantly related to cancer risks in Florida, conventional regression can hide important local variations in statistical relationships relevant to environmental justice analysis 
1	This paper investigates the relationships among neighborhood characteristics, education-related parental practices, and children's academic achievement during a critical but under-studied stage of children's educational trajectories - the elementary school years. Using a large, nationally representative database of American elementary school students - the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) - and contextual data from the 2000 US Census, we examine parental practices and neighborhood characteristics at the beginning of children's school careers (grades K-1) and their associations with math achievement through the end of the 5th grade. Findings: Net of family-level characteristics, higher levels of early education-oriented parental practices were associated with higher mathematics achievement at the end of 5th grade, while neighborhood disadvantage was associated with lower 5th grade math achievement. Families residing in high poverty, high unemployment, low-education neighborhoods employed fewer education-oriented practices with their kindergarten-first grade children, but the positive effect of such parental practices on children's mathematics achievement was stronger for children who live in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
1	This study builds on research demonstrating that sub-regions within the United States have different processes that abet poverty and that child poverty is spatially differentiated. We focus on the social attributes of the local area to assess what the geographic place represents in terms of social characteristics, namely racial/ethnic composition and economic structure, and to resolve apparent inconsistencies in poverty research. Using spatial regime and spatial error regression techniques to analyze county census data, we examine spatial differentiation in the relationships that generate child poverty. Our approach addresses the conceptual and technical aspects of spatial inequality. Results show that local-area processes are at play with implications for more nuanced theoretical models and anti-poverty policies that consider systematic differences in factors contributing to child poverty according to the racial/ethnic and economic contexts. 
0	Patterns of gender differences in educational outcomes among children of U.S. immigrants reflect trends of a female advantage in educational attainment and achievement that is increasingly common throughout U.S. society. However, these findings are more puzzling in the case of children of immigrants because this pattern is often such a sharp departure from that in most immigrants home countries, where women are often much less educated than men. Using data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS), this study examines gender differences in grade point averages and educational expectations among middle school and high school students from several ethnic groups, including Cubans, Mexicans, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Nicaraguans, Jamaicans, Haitians, Colombians, Laotians and Dominicans. The study finds that female advantages are consistent across ethnic groups, but the magnitude of gender gaps varies. Factors both at home and at school contribute to gender disparities. Girls spend more time on homework and less time watching television and perceive that their parents have higher aspirations for them; boys, on the other hand, have more negative perceptions of the school environment and are more focused on family relationships, perhaps to the detriment of school relationships. These findings suggest that processes in families and schools early on lead to later gender differences in educational attainment among children of immigrants.
1	"World-system scholars have traditionally emphasized the stability of the core/periphery hierarchy. However, prior network studies employing both categorical and continuous measures of world-system position reveal substantial mobility across time, whereby a number of developing states have become more integrated in the world economy over the past several decades. The developmental impact generated by such mobility remains unexplored. Using data on all commodities in the world trade network, I examine the presence and economic impact of world-system mobility across 110 states during the 1980-2000 period. First, I show that the continued upward mobility of ""middle-tier"" states from East Asia and the semiperiphery no longer contributes to the long-term trend of trade convergence, but began producing divergence during the final decades of the 20(th) century. Second, using difference models that control for lagged values, I find that world-system mobility positively affects economic growth, net of initial world-system position, capital and labor inputs, and other regional and economic characteristics. In fact, the magnitude of mobility's effect is substantially larger than that of initial world-system position and second only to initial human capital. These findings support a range of perspectives that are collectively useful for understanding the rapid economic growth of emerging states."

While we might expect that their non-conflicted beginnings in the parent will develop into non-conflicted relationships, some spin-off/parent relationships are more vulnerable to conflict. This is an important question given how commonly organizations intentionally create new groups to reach new targets and audiences. A poor relationship between parents and spin-off groups affects not just the two organizations, but also the rest of the social movement they operate in. To explore this relationship, I present two case studies of NOW spin off organizations - NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund (NOW LDEF) and the Catholics for a Free Choice (CFFC) - and present an argument for why NOW LDEF was so much more prone to conflict with NOW. I conclude with a discussion of what these findings mean for understanding of how organizational relationships develop over time, and what these relationships mean for their shared social movement.
1	Sociology is poised to greatly enhance our collective understanding of the various sustainability challenges facing the world today To contribute to this endeavor the authors conduct panel analyses of the per capita ecological footprints of nations to evaluate multiple theoretical traditions within environmental sociology and its sister approaches Findings indicate that the consumption-based environmental impacts of nations are tied to economic development urban population, militarization, and the structure of international trade Ecological conditions in the context of climate and biogeography also prove to partially shape the environmental harms of human activities Ultimately this research suggests that political-economic factors, ecological milieu and structural associations between nations all influence society/nature relationships Considering the globally unsustainable levels of resource consumption and concomitant increases in pollution for a growing number of nations throughout the world the authors contend that theoretically inclusive and methodologically rigorous investigations on such topics should be more central to the discipline 
0	Although abstract support for capital punishment has declined in recent years, the death penalty remains a contentious and conflict-laden issue in American society and politics.  Most research into social cleavages in death penalty support has focused on the racial basis of this tension and has overlooked class divisions.  To help fill this gap, I use the General Social Survey to examine the relationship between income and death penalty support across thirty years of recent American historya period that has seen several political transformations and the reintroduction of capital punishment in three-quarters of American states.  Low-income whites have evinced a striking transformation: while far less supportive of capital punishment than richer whites in the 1970s, they are now almost indistinguishable from wealthier whites.  After describing the contour of this relationship, I attempt to explain it with important changes in the American psyche and transformations in political and religious institutions.  Economic insecurity, racial resentment, social trust, and generalized fear all fail to account for the disappearance of the white income gap in death penalty support.  And changes in partisan affiliation, ideological identification, and adherence to a conservative religious tradition similarly cannot explain why poor and wealthy whites look so different.  Understanding the disappearance of the white income gap in death penalty support deserves future attention from researchers, especially given the increasingly frequent claims by capital punishment proponents that executions save working-class lives.
0	In this paper, I construct a set of population projections that provide a detailed look at the distribution of the multiracial population in the United States from 2000-2055. The population projections vary from other projections in that the projections presented in this paper projected a set of racial groups that included a subset of the mixed race population.  They are revealing in several ways.  First, they explore the full impact of the modern census practice of allowing the expression of mixed race identities on the Census. Second, by including the mixed race population these projections allow demographers and policy makers to view the outcome of current racial and ethnic compositional effects on future racial and ethnic compositions.  Finally, they show the effects of immigration and intermarriage rates on the size of different racial and ethnic groups. These more detailed projections of the multiracial population provide a useful starting point for thinking about the future of multiracial identity in the United States.
0	At its root, an analysis of the political economy, historical womanist theory is derived heavily from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’ dialectical and historical materialism. However, due to the unique nature of the role of Black women’s labor in the United States capitalist structure, historical womanist theory also draws from several other perspectives rooted in race, class, and gender analysis.  These perspectives are well suited to examine other elements of the processes of marginalization and exploitation specific to Black women in the US.  Also informed by womanist theory; material feminism; Black feminism; and critical race theory, historical womanism, offers a more pointed in-depth analysis of the social, political, and economic location of Black women as a unique laboring class that takes into account her position as: a person of African descent in a nation historically and fundamentally rooted in a racialized slave economy; her role as a woman in a profoundly patriarchal structure; and her position as laborer: productive; reproductive; and biological, within a capitalist system.
1	We analyze the relationship between Hispanic population growth and changes in U.S. rural income inequality from 1990 through 2000. Applying comparative approaches used for urban areas we disentangle Hispanic population growth's contribution to inequality by comparing and statistically modeling changes in the family income Gini coefficient across four rural county types: established Hispanic, rapidly growing Hispanic, rapidly growing non-Hispanic, and slow-growth or declining counties. Results support perspectives that stress growing social heterogeneity for understanding the contribution of minority population growth to inequality, including changes in human capital and industrial restructuring. We find remarkably similar inequality growth across rapidly growing Hispanic and non-Hispanic counties. This suggests that growing rural inequality stems largely from economic expansion and population growth rather than changing Hispanic composition.
1	"Falling under the rubric of ""post-gay,"" recent changes in gay life challenge theoretical accounts of collective identity by creating effects that, while acknowledged, have not yet been articulated using a parsimonious and portable framework. Consistent with conventional wisdom. LGBT activists construct collective identity using an oppositional ""us versus them"" formation during those times when they strategically deploy their differences from heterosexuals. But what happens when activists seek to emphasize their similarities to straights, as they are motivated to do during a post-gay moment? Drawing on interview and archival data of a college LGBT student organization, this article argues that in a post-gay era, activists construct collective identity using an inclusive, distinction-muting logic of ""us and them."" The shift from opposition (""versus"") to inclusion (""and"") implies that activists today are motivated less by drawing boundaries against members of the dominant group and more by building bridges toward them. The article concludes with critiques of and implications for post-gay politics."
1	As our understanding of disaster shifts from an event concentrated in time and space to a social occasion occurring across time and space, so too must our explanations of disaster shift from theories of the middle range to broader theoretical frameworks. We explore the world-system approach in an effort to understand the upper limits of theory for disaster and offer this approach as a better understanding of how long-term development shapes social change. Utilizing media reports of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami from the United States to India, Indonesia and Thailand over a one-year period, we find perceptions of aid vary by economic zones and nation-states in the contemporary world system.
0	While research exists that addresses both the importance of offering ex-felons employment opportunities and the hesitant attitudes of employers toward such ex-felons, there is a lack of research investigating the specific factors that influence an employer in his or her hiring decision toward an ex-felon.  Thus, this paper presents preliminary findings from an ongoing exploratory analysis of surveys completed by hiring personnel from a variety of employment fields.  Factors specifically influencing an employers decision of whether or not to hire an ex-felon are discussed.  This research also investigates how demographic variables about the employer such as age and race influence employers hiring practices toward ex-felons.  This paper ends with a discussion of how labeling theory explains the ongoing unemployability that countless ex-felons face each day.
0	We report on research that bridges status characteristics theory and self categorization theory. The integrated theory explains joint effects of group membership and status on influence. We then present experimental data that test for differences in behavioral interaction types amongst those possessing different states of status and/or prototypicality. Preliminary findings indicate that being designated the prototypical group member positively affects type of behavior interaction. Additionally, status behavior differentiation is highest when individuals possess high states of both status and prototypicality.
0	Family change in the past twenty to thirty years proved to be an extremely challenging issue for family (sociological) studies. Phenomena such as the decreasing marriage rate and birth rate, the increasing divorce rate and number of unmarried (cohabitating) couples, DINK couples, single mothers, homosexual couples etc. are characterizing contemporary family changes in a global context. Interpreting and presenting these family changes, however, do not appear to be an easy task. Traditional (pre-modern), modern and post-modern ideologies concerning the family are competing for hegemony in interpreting current changes. The question here is whether the sociologists of family are capable to present these changes in a united academic way that could serve as a universal compass. The problem becomes very complex if one recalls the fact that after World War II, two competing political (ideological) systems became realized in non-Western countries, a socialist modern and a (non-Western) capitalist modern, and that the two systems had different (competitive) ideologies concerning family. This Cold-War heritage may have a negative effect on promoting a potential post-modern paradigm shift. In accordance with this problem, I chose four non-Western societies in quest of potential paradigm shifts: Hungary and China representing two different ways of (post-)socialism, as well as, Taiwan and Japan representing non-Western capitalist modernization with a remarkable difference in their relations to their pre-war (traditional) family systems.
1	Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, this study employs propensity score modeling to measure the effects of participation in varsity football (among men) and varsity basketball (among men and women) in the 10th grade on students' CPAs and math test scores in the twelfth grade. This study also investigates whether the effect of sports participation on student achievement differs between black and white students. The results show that participation in varsity football negatively affects the 12th grade GPAs of black, but not white, men but does not affect the math test scores of either of these subgroups. Moreover, varsity basketball participation leads to higher GPAs in the 12th grade among white, but not black, women. Implications of the different operationalizations of sports participation, the investigation of different student subpopulations, and the different methods of analysis are discussed. 
1	Many social processes are described only in ordinary language, though often there are advantages to stating the ideas more precisely using mathematics. Intuitive ad hoc models are less valuable than are models representing explicit theories because theoretical models are useful beyond particular situations for which they were created. We describe 13 ways in which individuals might use information about status structures and communication from others to guide their behavior, and construct simple mathematical models of the processes. Three models derive from explicit theoretical assumptions and 10 are based in intuitive ideas about how individuals process information. Next we assess empirical success of the 13 models by comparing their predictions to behavior in an experimental setting. All the models fare well by comparison with a null hypothesis of no effects of structure or interaction, but the theoretically-based models make the best predictions. We discuss some reasons for the outcomes and for the intuitive appeal of intuitive models. Both the poorer predictions and the intuitive appeal of intuitive models, oddly enough, may trace to their lack of conditionalizing their predictions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	Some argue that social capital is directly related to democracy.  Such scholars claim that as social connectedness increases individuals will acquire a better understanding of their own interests, leading to an increase in the richness, frequency, and scope of open democratic deliberation. It is argued here that the relationship between social capital and democratic deliberation is mitigated by the political macro-structure - the institutionalized patterns of relationships that structure interaction within a community of speakers. To assess this claim, a study of community opinion leaders was conducted in River City  a small city that underwent rapid de-industrialization in the 1980s. A social network analysis of community organizations shows that the political macro-structure in River City was transformed during this time  from a bi-polar environment consisting of labor union/populist faction and business/elite faction towards a uni-polar environment consisting of one cluster of individuals from both of the older factions. Ethnographic interviews shows that this has changed the relationship between social capital and democratic deliberation: when the political macro-structure was bi-polar, those with the most social capital tended to be most partisan and most in favor of open democratic debate while those with the most social capital today (i.e. in a uni-polar macro-structure) tend to be the least partisan and favor non-public forms of deliberation and decision making. Thus, it is argued that social capital increases democratic deliberation only if the political macro-structure is characterized by an institutionalized conflict; by contrast, increased social capital could lead to a decrease in democratic deliberation in the absence of such conflict.
0	Utilizing current ecological and crime data for over 1600 counties, we assess whether effects of family structure on homicide vary across measurement of family structure and gender.  Seemingly unrelated regression results indicate that family structure provides a powerful social context that may inhibit or engender violence.  Measures tapping parental absence (i.e., mother and father absence and shortages of employed men) have robust violence-producing effects on women and men; divorce and sex ratios are unrelated to homicide offending.  Results also reveal that family structure is a multidimensional concept.  Findings indicate mainly gender-similarity in family structural sources of homicide  parental absence matters regardless of gender  though male homicide patterns were impacted somewhat more by conditions of father absence and the marriage pool, yielding subtle gender differences.
0	This study examined the indigenous identities of urban American Indian youth as measured by a set of variables that were related to intertribal cultural elements identified through community-based participatory research. Data came from a pilot and randomized control trial of a culturally adapted substance use prevention program. The study included 142 urban American Indian middle school students in 6th through 9th grades from five schools in a metropolitan area in the southwest United States. Exploratory data analysis techniques were used to describe connections to a variety of potential sources of indigenous identity: tribal affiliation, reservation experiences, ethnicity and ethnic identity, spirituality, use and understanding of native language, positive orientations toward native and non-native cultures, native cultural practices, and the youth’s own words for how they identify and describe what makes them American Indian. Although urban American Indians may face challenges in maintaining their tribal identities due to inter-ethnic and inter-tribal marriage, long-distance migration, and pressures to acculturate into the cultural mainstream, the youth in this study appeared strongly moored to their native indigenous heritage.  They reported a clear sense of American Indian identity, firm family and personal ties to tribal reservations, a strong but not exclusive alignment with American Indian culture, extensive involvement in Indian cultural practices, and a diverse but largely shared vocabulary for describing their Indian identities. Implications for future research and intervention approaches to enhance the potential of protective factors related to strong indigenous identification are discussed.
1	This article engages with problems that are usually opaque: What trajectories do scientific debates assume, when does a scientific community consider a proposition to be a fact, and how can we know that? We develop a strategy for evaluating the state of scientific contestation on issues. The analysis builds from Latour's black box imagery, which we observe in scientific citation networks. We show that as consensus forms, the importance of internal divisions to the overall network structure declines. We consider substantive cases that are now considered facts, such as the carcinogenicity of smoking and the non-carcinogenicity of coffee. We then employ the same analysis to currently contested cases: the suspected carcinogenicity of cellular phones, and the relationship between vaccines and autism. Extracting meaning from the internal structure of scientific knowledge carves a niche for renewed sociological commentary on science, revealing a typology of trajectories that scientific propositions may experience en route to consensus.
1	How do social movements promote diversity and alternative organizational forms? We address this question by analyzing how cooperative enterprise was affected by the Grange-a leading anticorporate movement in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. State-level analyses across three industries yield three findings. First, the Grange had positive effects on cooperatives and mutuals during the nineteenth-century populist struggles over corporate capitalism. Second, these effects were stronger where corporations counter-mobilized to block challengers' political efforts. Grangers pursued economic organization as an alternative to politics and in response to blocked political access. Third, the Grange continued to foster cooperatives even as populist revolts waned. It did so, however by buffering cooperatives from problems of group heterogeneity and population change, rendering them less dependent on supportive communities and specific economic conditions. These findings advance research at the movements/organizations interface by documenting movement effects and by isolating different causal pathways through which mobilization, counter-mobilization, and political opportunity shape economic organization. The results also provide economic sociology with new evidence on how social structure moderates economic forces, and help revise institutional analyses of American capitalism by showing how cooperatives emerged as significant, rather than aberrant, elements of the US. economy.
1	Is there an association between occupational racial composition and nonfatal workplace injuries? Guided by several labor market theories (queuing, social closure, devaluation, poor market position, and human capital), we use occupational data from the U. S. Census and Dictionary of Occupational Titles combined with individual data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to answer this question. Hierarchical generalized linear models of individuals within occupations show that there is an association between occupational racial composition and workplace injuries, but this association is only statistically significant for white men in the model controlling for relevant occupational and individual level characteristics. A 10 percent increase in the occupation percent black is associated with a 28 percent increase in injury risk. Contrary to expectations, white men have the highest adjusted odds of injury; white women and black men have significantly lower odds of injury than white men. Additionally, occupation-level environmental hazards and individual-level education, hours worked per week, jobs with insurance benefits, working in the South, and specific industries are associated with differential injury risk. These findings are consistent with labor market theories that suggest social closure, market position, and individual skills contribute to differential labor market outcomes. We demonstrate that sociological theories of labor market inequality are useful for understanding workplace injury risk, and that workplace injuries should be studied as an outcome of social inequality. Keywords: occupational racial composition, work injury, health, labor markets, and social inequality.
0	This research supported by Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SRP of the Centra Ueropena University in Budapest) is focused on students’ development of critical thinking (CT) in the course of studying three social disciplines - Theories of Social Work, Social Policy and Sociology of Family. These courses have been taught to two different classes, correspondingly first two courses – to combined second and third year undergraduate students, and the second one-to the students of fourth year of study. The paper studies the dynamics of learning abilities while implementing special teaching strategies like facilitating discussions, creating teacher-student interactions and establishing student oriented lecturing. The idea of the research project is to study not only the dynamics of CT in general but to look at the changes of their constitutive parts, or traits, as well. Special attention is given to developing of connectivity – within courses, with other courses and with everyday life including personal experiences-as well as contextualization and conceptualization. The data has been collected at the St. Petersburg University of Humanities and Social Sciences during 2008-2009 academic years at the Department of Social Work. Assessment of the developing of the CT traits development in the course of study is made mostly on the basis of essays while portfolio of discussions, short reaction papers, surveys and other written assignments have contributed to better understanding of where students are in the subjects taught.
0	In recent years, the sixth Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyasto becomes extremely popular among Han Chinese. Behind the public passion about Tsangyang Gyasto is the fantasy of idyllic, mysterious and spiritual Tibet -- an image that persists in Western imaginations. Scholars been discussing and debating on the nature of such imagery and its formation for decades. However, what has been missing in the discussion is the Orient’s imagery of the other Orient. This study explores the structural conditions of such Chinese imagery. I argue that the Tsangyang Gyasto myth is an extension of the Chinese frontier imagination tradition. With the grown the post-materialism values and increasing popularity of the strangely familiar Tibetan religion and art, the general public grows the desire for a fantasy, as a cure for their daily life in the modern world. At the same time, the evolving state-media regime in China creates a structural room for the myth. A Tibet-related issue is constructed into a secular fantasy. So both the historical and political structure offers the opportunity for the Han Chinese fantasy on Tsayngyang Gyasto.
1	Over the past half century, a large body of theoretical and empirical work in sociology and other social sciences has emphasized the negative consequences of mobility for human development in general, and youth outcomes in particular. In criminology, decades of research have documented a link between residential mobility and crime at both the macro and micro levels. At the micro level, mobility is associated with delinquency, substance use, and other deviant behaviors among adolescents. However, it is possible that the relationship between mobility and delinquency may be due to selection on pre-existing differences between mobile and non-mobile youth in their propensity for delinquency, and prior studies have not adequately addressed this issue. Specifically, the families that are most likely to move are also the most disadvantaged and may be characterized by dynamics and processes that are conducive to the development of delinquency and problem behavior in their children. This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to assess the impact of residential and school mobility between the ages of 12 and 17 on delinquency and substance use. Random effects models control for selection on both observed and unobserved differences. Results show that mobility and delinquency are indeed spuriously related. Implications for future research on mobility and outcomes are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	Much of the confusion surrounding the concept of social capital lies in the fact that in its current formulation, it has been framed using two distinct, but related, perspectives: (1) as an asset of communities or larger social structures, such as nations, and (2) as an asset of individuals. In this paper, a measure of social is presented. The measure takes into account the ways in which instrumental actions become successful through the mobilization of resources through social networks, and how such actions link individuals to micro-, meso-, and macro-social structures. The measure, therefore, consists of three parts: 1) social trust; 2) social networks; 3) voluntary association. It is argued that, taken together, these three constructs constitute a multifaceted measure of social capital that holds the potential for increasing our understanding of the processes through which social relations influence a variety of key sociological outcomes.
0	Immigration and psychological wellbeing is an important topic, but the mixed findings from the past literature do not allow qualified conclusions. This paper uses data from the National Health Interview Survey to find out the patterns of todays immigrants psychological well-being by comparing them with native-born population and look for the key factors that shape immigrants mental health. The results suggest that immigrants, despite the hardship they are confronted with, actually have greater psychological wellbeing than natives. Immigrants are less anxious and less depressed than their native-born counterparts, though immigration is found to have a more powerful impact on lowering the anxiety level than decreasing depression. Furthermore, the difference of psychological distress between immigrants and non-immigrants are net of effects of controls (except the suppressing effects of education and income on depression) inclines me to the immigration selectivity explanation. These distress patterns are in accordance of some previous small-scale studies on mental health of immigrants and strikingly consistent with findings from the sociological research on nativity and physical health, i.e., the epidemiological paradox.
0	This study examines naturalization rates in the Southeast and compares them to other regions while investigating some political consequences of naturalization. In numbers of naturalized citizens and in naturalization rates, the Southeast lags behind states with long immigration histories. In all southeastern states Asians comprise the largest group of naturalized citizens, but naturalization rates vary. Mexicans and Central Americans are the least likely to obtain citizenship in all southeastern states. We also find and discuss a small immigrant presence in the U.S. House of Representatives and a significant positive correlation between states’ naturalization rates and percentage of the state that voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election.
0	Japan has a demographically small but politically and theoretically significant minority population.  Studies of minorities in East Asia tend to be descriptive, focus on a single group, and rarely examine the interconnections among race-ethnicity, national identity, and state development.  This paper applies the concepts of state racialization project and racial formation to explore processes of the creation, modification, and maintenance of racial-ethnic categories, statuses, and relations in Japan.  Until very recently, the state did not acknowledge minorities and promoted cultural-ethnic homogeneity.  Characteristics of the minority populations and the trajectory of nation state development, including the racialization project, (i.e., state practices and policies with regard to minorities) shaped racial formation in Japan.
0	In this paper, we elaborate a political mediation model of the impacts of social movements on states.  We appraise this model against several alternatives in the literature, including arguments based on mobilization, strategies, framing, and political opportunities.  Our case is the U.S. old-age pension movement of the 1930s and 1940s.  We employ two sorts of data analyses.   One is an overtime comparison of social movement campaigns and episodes of policy-making.  These allow fine grained appraisals of models.  The second involves two quantitative analyses.  The first addresses congressional voting for a 1939 House bill supported by the Townsend plan, the largest national mass old-age pension organization.  The second is of average OAA spending after the Social Security Act.  We address the influence of state-level campaigns led by a variety of old-age pension organizations.  Both analyses show differential influence of the old-age pension organizations and provide support for the political mediation model.
1	This research adopts a structural identity theory framework to examine post-recruitment activism in the Irish Republican Movement. The data are from members of Provisional Sinn Fein who were first interviewed in the mid-1980s and subsequently reinterviewed in the mid-1990s and the late 2000s. Ten and 20 years after their initial interviews, some respondents were still involved in Provisional Sinn Fein while others had: helped create a rival organization, Republican Sinn Fein, in 1986; helped create another rival organization, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, in 1997; withdrawn from activism; and withdrawn from and then reentered activism. The interviews show that the decision to exit from activism was primarily motivated by changes in the respondents' personal lives and not for political reasons. For some respondents, life changes brought with them new relationships and new identities that limited their availability for activism and also forced respondents to choose between competing identities. The decision to remain an activist but to create a rival organization was influenced by interaction among subgroups of activists in Provisional Sinn Fein and by the respondents' perception of what is important for Irish Republicanism.
0	Previous research has detailed the disparate relationship outcomes of youth who spend time outside two-biological-parent households. They are simultaneously more likely to marry at young ages, but also to cohabit as their first unions and to delay marriage. We can understand this intergenerational transmission of relationship behaviors: those who have seen their parents’ marriages break down or their parents never marry are more likely to eschew marriage for cohabitation and married parenthood for nonmarital childbearing. However, this logic does not hold in understanding the early entrance into marriage of a segment of this population. This paper asks: Who are those that rapidly embrace marriage and family formation despite having seen very little evidence of its success in their own homes? The present study develops a prospective relationship orientation typology, which focuses on the key characteristics that distinguish, what are termed, Believers, Skeptics, and Unlikely Optimists. By comparing these three groups of youth, we gain a better understanding of the distinctive prospective relationship orientations they have already formed in adolescence, which lay the groundwork for their family formation decisions in young adulthood. Implications of results are discussed for those interested in high school relationship education and adolescent pregnancy prevention.
0	Meaning construction and its impact on the production of justice has received a great deal of attention by sociologists and criminologists.  Despite an impressive body of research and a great deal of agreement on the factors associated with punishment recommendations and outcomes, few researchers have addressed the underlying process of interpretation and construction that inspires the creation of court reports and recommendations.  Even fewer have systematically dealt with the possible social origins of probation officer recommendations to the court.  In this paper I apply the analytical tools of Snow and Benfords (1988) framing perspective, currently popular among social movement researchers, to the question of probation officer decision-making.  Using data derived from a two year ethnographic study of a juvenile court, I found that the forty-eight probation officers of West County routinely used and negotiated eight frames when talking to each other about their cases.  Furthermore, I found that the frames employed by these probation officers influenced the recommendations officers made to the court, and their actions taken in the field.
1	There is widespread interest in understanding anti-Muslim prejudice in Europe, but there is little systematic evidence about the extent and patterns of the prejudice. Using data from the 1999-2000 wave of European Values Study this article examines the extent and determinants of anti-Muslim prejudice in both Western and Eastern Europe. We find that prejudice against Muslims was more widespread than prejudice against other immigrants, and that the effects of individual and country-level predictors of prejudice resemble those found in research on anti-minority prejudice in general. Fairly similar results were obtained for both Eastern and Western Europe, but the aggregate levels of prejudice are higher in the East. Our results imply that Muslims in Europe were particularly prone to becoming targets of prejudice, even before the attacks of September 11. The results give some support to group-conflict theory, mainly with regard to the effects of the unemployment. However, the size of Muslim population in a country does not seem to increase the level of anti-Muslim prejudice. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	This article describes the impact of the Italian electoral reforms of 1993 on the structure of local political alliances. The reform, which moved Italy from a purely proportional representation system to a mixed, largely majoritarian system, was designed to increase transparency, reduce corruption, limit the number of political parties, and create the conditions for a politics of interests rather than a politics of influence. Paradoxically, moving to a mixed electoral system had the opposite effect. In this article we demonstrate this impact by modeling the structure of political alliances at multiple levels (municipal, provincial and regional) of the Italian polity from 1984 to 2001.
1	Using tract-level data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census, this study addresses four questions: (1. Has the proportion of neighborhoods with high ethnic concentration changed in from 1990 to 2000? (2. What are the socio-demographic profiles of ethnic neighborhoods? (3. Are new ethnic neighborhoods forming in America's suburbs? (4. How common are ethnoburbs-that is, affluent, suburban, ethnic neighborhoods? For most racial/ethnic groups, the number and share of ethnic neighborhoods grew from 1990 to 2000 and the suburbanization trend was remarkable. Asian neighborhoods as a whole experienced the fastest growth. Ethnoburbs have formed across the country. Although ethnoburbs are more an Asian phenomenon, Hispanic and black ethnoburbs have also developed. These patterns support the segmented assimilation model and the resurgence of ethnicity perspectives.
1	Does increasing the minimum wage reduce the high school completion rate? Previous research has suffered from (1. narrow time horizons, (2. potentially inadequate measures of states' high school completion rates, and (3. potentially inadequate measures of minimum wage rates. Overcoming each of these limitations, we analyze the impact of changes in state and federal minimum wage rates on state high school completion rates for the graduating classes of 1982 through 2005. Our state-level analyses, which consist of a series of state and year fixed-effects models with controls for state-year time-varying covariates, provide no support for the argument that increasing the minimum wage reduces rates of high school completion.
0	Contemporary public discussions about the “obesity epidemic” and its consequences tend to focus on the potential impacts weight can have on one’s health and quality of life. To the extent that associations between socioeconomic status and weight enter the conversation, it is usually to acknowledge that lower-SES people (especially the urban poor) may have limited access to fresh produce and gym memberships. In this paper, however, I examine the social and economic consequences of fatness. Using statistical data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), this paper draws on economic theories of statistical and prejudicial discrimination to examine the nature and the extent of the disadvantages overweight people face. Building on previous findings of overweight income disadvantage in this dataset [in particular, Gortmaker et al (1993)], my study finds significant gender differences in the presence and amount of discrimination affecting women’s and men’s income. Further, due to differing types of discrimination (statistical for overweight men and prejudicial for overweight women), this study suggests that the disadvantages overweight women face are not only more severe than those experienced by overweight men, but also that these disadvantages will worsen over time relative to overweight men’s.
0	This study attempted to examine the mechanism through which social support might affects health for racial/ethnic populations in the United States.  It was hypothesized that inequality might affect African-American infant mortality rates through (1) social support, or (2) risk profile of the mother. Using state-level data from several sources, the 2000 National Center for Health Statistics Linked Birth Infant Death database, 2000 U.S. Census, and 2000 General Social Survey, a number of regression equations were estimated. Results indicated that social support does not have any mediating effects on African-American infant mortality and inequality relationship. But for African Americans, the effect of inequality on IMRs was found to be mediated by the risk profile of the mother, namely, the increased likelihood of smoking and/or drinking and/or less prenatal care by Black women during pregnancy.
1	We use data from the Voting and Registration Supplement Of the Current Population Survey to explore the effects of family structure on turnout in the 2000 presidential election. Our results indicate that family structure, defined as marital status and the presence of children, has substantial consequences for turnout. Married adults are more likely to vote than are those who have never been married, in turn, previously married people are the lightest voters. Children have a smaller but still noteworthy effect on turnout. These results are only partially explained by social and demographic differences.
1	Limited research has examined how family environments are associated with the relationship context of first sex, an important indicator of reproductive health risk. We use data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to assess the association between the family environment - parent-parent relationships, parent-adolescent relationships, and family structure - and relationship context of first heterosexual sexual intercourse, distinguishing between the transition to first sex in serious and casual relationships. Twenty-five percent of females and 43% of males who had sex by age 18 did so in a casual relationship. All dimensions of the family environment were linked to the relationship context of first sex. Notably, higher parental monitoring was associated with a reduced risk of transitioning to first sex in a casual relationship versus no sex, and greater family routines were associated with a reduced risk of transitioning to sex in a steady relationship versus having no sex, for males and females. A strong maternal-adolescent relationship was associated with a reduced risk of first sex in a casual relationship but only for males. Additionally, in two-parent families, a strong father-adolescent relationship was associated with reduced risk of transitioning to casual sex, but only for females. Pregnancy and STI prevention programs should work with parents to foster positive parent-adolescent relationships, to become aware of their adolescents' activities and to recognize that parents are important models for adolescent relationship behaviors. 
1	This paper engages two core ideas: first, that status mobility is facilitated through connectivity, or having a large number of ties to others, as suggested by theories of social capital and social networks; and second, that aggression is an expressive or irrational reaction to frustrations, humiliations, or social pathologies. In contrast, I argue that in certain contexts, both of these propositions are reversed: status is attained through selective bridging rather than high network connectivity, and aggression is instrumental for social climbing, particularly when it is directed toward high status, aggressive, or socially close targets. The argument is expected to hold only in contexts that are small (in terms of the number of participants), bounded (in terms of the ease and frequency with which they are entered and exited), and flat (in terms of formal hierarchy). Data from a longitudinal survey of adolescents combined with information from their high school yearbooks provide a unique opportunity to test these propositions, which are supported. High connectivity decreases the likelihood of attaining high status, while selective bridging increases it. Status is further enhanced by reputational, as opposed to physical, aggression, and decreased by victimization. Moreover, aggression toward aggressive, high status, or socially close peers provide additional status boosts. These effects hold regardless of the extent to which status is desired.
1	Using couples' time-diary data from two French time-use surveys ( 1986, 1999), this article explores the extent to which off-scheduling within dual-earner couples is an unequal and negative externality for family time. An empirical typology of family workdays is built using a variant of optimal matching, and three kinds of family time are taken into account: conjugal time, father- and mother-child time, and parents-child time. The results indicate that off-scheduling is an unintentional by-product of employers' economic interests and that, since it reduces conjugal and parents-child time but fails to foster temporal complementarity between parents, it is a negative factor for family solidarity.
0	Previous research has documented that early disadvantages lay the groundwork for persistence of socioeconomic adversity across the life course and across generations. Several theoretical models have been developed to explain this phenomenon but little is known about how the different aspects of socioeconomic adversity emphasized by these models uniquely influence the socioeconomic attainment of young adults.  We address this issue using longitudinal, prospective data and census data.  Results from multilevel regression analyses indicate that African Americans, youth from poor communities, and lower SES families have achieved significantly lower levels of earnings, assets, and job quality in their young adulthood. Young adults’ education level partially buffered the negative influence of these factors as well as accentuated the positive influences of family resources. The present study demonstrates the intergenerational continuity of socioeconomic adversity.
0	Does globalization destroy culture?  This paper attempts to summarize and critique the disparate perspectives on the interaction between globalization, consumption, and culture.  Both McDonaldization and hybridization are accurate representations of what is happening in the world today.  Yet, both viewpoints find support by looking at only part of the picture of globalization.  McDonaldization is an oversimplified theory that has several theoretical and empirical weaknesses: assumptions about the nature of culture and authenticity, the weakness of the local, the margin/center relationship between the global and the local, and spatial (as well as consumer choice) determinism.  While the theory of hybridization may exaggerate the power of culture in the face of Western profit seeking and neoliberal tendencies.  By pointing out the serious flaws in these competing explanations I hope to indicate a more useful direction for the study of globalization and consumption which neglects neither the dynamism of culture nor the power of political economy.
1	Although gene by environment studies are typically based on the assumption that some individuals possess genetic variants that enhance their vulnerability to environmental adversity, the differential susceptibility perspective posits that these individuals are simply more susceptible to environmental influence than others. An important implication of this perspective is that individuals most vulnerable to adverse social environments are the same ones who reap the most benefit from environmental support. Using longitudinal data from a sample of several hundred African Americans, we found that relatively common variants of the dopamine receptor gene and the serotonin transporter gene interact with social conditions to predict aggression in a manner consonant with the differential susceptibility perspective. When social conditions were adverse, individuals with these genetic variants manifested more aggression than other genotypes, whereas when the environment was favorable they demonstrated less aggression than other genotypes. Furthermore, we found that these genetic variants interact with environmental conditions to foster schemas and emotions consistent with the differential susceptibility perspective and that a latent construct formed by these schemas and emotions mediates the gene by environment interaction on aggression.
1	This study examines the relationship between crime and processes of urban revitalization, or gentrification. Drawing on recent urban demography research, we hypothesize that gentrification progressed rapidly in many American cities over the last decade of the twentieth century, and that these changes had implications for area crime rates. Criminological theories hold competing hypotheses for the connections between gentrification and crime, and quantitative studies of this link remain infrequent and limited. Using two measures of gentrification and longitudinal tract-level demographic and crime data for the city of Seattle, we find that many of Seattle's downtown tracts underwent rapid revitalization during the 1990s, and that these areas (1) saw reductions in crime relative to similar tracts that did not gentrify, and (2) were areas with higher-than-average crime at the beginning of the decade. Moreover, using a within-tract longitudinal design, we find that yearly housing investments in the 1980s showed a modest positive association with crime change, while yearly investments in the 1990s showed the opposite pattern. Our findings suggest a curvilinear gentrification-crime relationship, whereby gentrification in its earlier stages is associated with small increases in crime, but gentrification in its more consolidated form is associated with modest crime declines. Implications of these results for criminological theory, urban development, and broader crime patterns are discussed.
0	Social movements worldwide evoked by globalization, though separated by time and place, often affect one another because of their common origin and related contexts. What effects do social movements targeting core countries and social movements targeting non-core countries (or non-core émigrés) have on each other?  This study explored the effects of Al Qaeda as a social movement (originating in non-core countries which had its moment in the spotlight with the September 11, 2001 attacks), on the anti-immigrant movement in the United States (which peaked in 1994 with California Proposition 187, threatening to deny social services to immigrants and their children).  The research design included two data sets:  first, a control group of 18 ethnographic interviews with leading anti-immigrant activists conducted just before September 11, 2001 and, second, six follow-up interviews with anti-immigrant activists, along with participant observation at two post-9/11 anti-immigrant conferences.  Results revealed:  (1) a boost to anti-immigrant organizing at the national level focused on defending America that did not, however, elicit a surge in anti-immigrant activism as witnessed in 1994.  (2) Californias white-led activists maintained a mainly anti-Mexican focus, whereas, the national level anti-immigrant organizations more notably targeted Arabs and Muslims.  (3) Interviews revealed a more evident connection than previously recognized between overt hate-groups (including published biological determinists, arguing for the separation of the races) and anti-immigrant activists (often considered to be less overt hate-groups).  (4) Finally, anti-immigrant sentiment perpetuated racial stereotypes, with regard to perceived race, religion, or nation of origin, and according to gender.
0	In this paper we will compare the labor force outcomes and integration of the two largest immigrant groups (Moroccans and Romanians) within the European country who had have the highest  rate of immigration in the past years -Spain. These top immigrant communities are estimated to have about 720,000 members each, the latter being the fastest growing immigrant community. The two immigrant groups differ both in term of history of migration (with Moroccans being the first to come, Romanians the fastest growing), ethnicity/race and ability to learn the language (Romanian and Spanish are both Latin languages, which makes it easier for Romanians than Moroccans to learn Spanish).
1	I explore the relationship between active-duty military service and self-reported health measured at age 40 Based on selectivity veterans of active-duty service might be expected to have better health than civilians Using data taken from the NLSY-79 I show that this is not the case Although veterans of reserve-duty service and nonveterans who passed the military's physical exam for entrance into the military report better physical health active-duty veterans do not The lower than expected self-reported health of active-duty veterans cannot be explained by differences on confounding variables such as income, education, and marital status In addition the lower physical health of these veterans cannot be explained by differences in health-related behaviors such as excessive alcohol use cigarette smoking and body mass index 
0	This paper focuses on the war-making practices of European and subsequently North American states between 1815 and 1909, both as these states waged war against one another and in their respective colonies, highlighting variation in the extent to which states intentionally and systematically targeted and attacked civilians.  The central goal of this paper is to explain the emergence of intentional attack on civilians in war in the period before the World Wars, which have garnered most scholarly attention, but by which time the movement toward lack of restraint was well underway.  The authors attempt to explain the erosion of restraint in European and colonial civil and interstate wars by focusing on the role of conventional restraints on war-makingexpressed in the prevailing laws of warin guiding practice, and examining in detail how the interaction of racial othering, taking up arms against ones own state, and taking up arms against another state without authorization of ones own state contributed in different war-making contexts to destabilize pre-existing distinctions between combatants and non-combatants in war, undermining historical protections for civilians.  Substantiation of these claims is drawn from analysis of all conflicts during the period in question drawn the Correlates of War dataset, and bolstered by insights drawn from select historical case studies
0	This paper analyzes ethnographic data which reveals the fraught nature of Somali group identity and the public definition of Somali-ness which emerged in Lewiston, Maine, in the early years of Somali immigrant settlement in the city. Within public perception of Somalis I find persistent attention to the idea of Somalis as a bounded and cohesive group. I conclude that the emphasis on “the Somali community” persists despite increasing recognition of the limits of such an approach for service provision or for understanding intra-Somali community dynamics. In demonstrating that Somali inclusion in the broader community hinged upon the ability to construct and to ownership of a morally-acceptable group identity, this research corroborates Povinelli’s (2002) observation that multicultural citizenship requirements exercise a particular form of domination over indigenous and minority citizens. Those who would count as diverse are required to perform their diversity and, yet, to do it authentically.
0	In our comparative perspective we use six nation cultures to test if supernatural attributions differentiate religious and secular authority. Using semantic dimensions derived from Osgood we empirically match the affective meaning of identities to the Christian concept of God with secular alter-identities. The same mechanism is used to identify behaviors, emotions and traits that are attributed to God and his alter-identity. Using the symbolic integrationist perspective of Affect Control Theory we extent this analysis by setting identities, behaviors and emotions into the context of an event. We find that the concept of God represents religious authority that in secular societies is perfectly replaced by other authority concepts in legal, political, professional, medical, or family institutions. While data of the US, Canada, and Ireland establish a cluster of religious attributions to authority, Germany, Japan, and China cluster on the secular side.
0	The purpose of this paper is to investigate parenting as a dynamic process that evolves as parents develop expertise in their role and adapt to the changing needs of the child and family. We first document mothers trajectories of positive and consistent parenting using four waves of data collected biennially between 1994 and 2000 from a nationally representative sample of 2107 Canadian children aged two to five who continuously reside with two biological parents. We then examine the extent to which these trajectories are influenced by child and family level factors. Finally, we test the resource dilution hypothesis which suggests that because parenting resources are finite, parenting practices are more easily depleted in households that are larger rather than smaller, and that the entrance of a new sibling into the household further diffuses parenting practices. Results from growth curve models suggest that parents generally exhibit declines in positive parenting over time, but increase their levels of consistent parenting. The implications of significant child and family characteristics on these parenting trajectories as well as our findings of mixed support for the resource dilution hypothesis are discussed.

1	Decades of racial progress have led some researchers and policy makers to doubt that discrimination remains an important cause of economic inequality. To study contemporary discrimination, we conducted afield experiment in the low-wage labor market of New York City, recruiting white, black, and Latina job applicants who were matched on demographic characteristics and interpersonal skills. These applicants were given equivalent resumes and sent to apply in tandem for hundreds of entry-level jobs. Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer In fact, black and Latina applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison. Additional qualitative evidence from our applicants 'experiences further illustrates the multiple points at which employment trajectories can be deflected by various forms of racial bias. These results point to the subtle yet systematic forms of discrimination that continue to shape employment opportunities for low-wage workers.
0	In this paper I propose a new theoretical and methodological tools to assess immigrant integration process. Most sociological studies on assimilation process focused on upward social mobility of immigrants while leaving out politics. The politics of immigrants, often neglected, were treated as a separate domain from socio-economic mobility. I argue, however, that the choice between upward socio-economic mobility and active political participation is a central dilemma for the immigrants and their children. Some immigrants focus only on individual success through education and stable employment; some realize that group-level political mobilization could bring them the benefits as well; and other find themselves between these two strategies. How immigrants situate themselves within this continuum of market success and political power, I argue, is a key factor in immigrant integration to the U.S. society. To test this model, I analyze the data on immigrant second generation in New York City and develop four different typologies of immigrant strategies, using Latent Class Models. Then I explain the strategies more in detail by analyzing in-depth interview data. In the end, I discuss the implication of my model to some of the previous theories of immigrant integration, such as new assimilation and segmented assimilation.
0	The criminalization of immigration has preceded in successive stages including establishment of the criminal alien program, designation of aggravated felonies for deportation, denial of due process rights, and expedited removal procedures. These procedures were in place before application in the “securitization of immigration.” After 9/11, a result has been massive retroactive deportation of Mexican and Central American nationals that exceeds their rate of presence in the population. The Violent Gang Task Force, Operation Community Shield and Operation Return to Sender are probable sources of racial profiling producing this disparity. A precursor to the mass repatriation of Latinos is a costly stay in an expensive abusive detention system now expanded by undocumented migrants apprehended crossing the border. This record implies civil and human rights violation which should be addressed by policy change.
0	Environmental education, research, and professionalization in universities is expanding everywhere around the world.  Standard explanations of curricular reform emphasize the role of local processes, set in motion by environmental degradation.  Instead, we suggest a top-down causal mechanism hinging on the ontological elaboration and rationalization of “nature” and its epistemological clarification at the level of world society.  We test this approach first in cross-sectional regression analyses of the total number of environmental-degree programs and second in longitudinal Poisson analyses of the count of environmental-degree programs established between 1985 and 2009 for a global sample of universities.  In both sets of analyses, the top-down global explanation proves stronger than the bottom-up alternative.  Universities adopt environmental education when substance and significance are attributed to the entity “nature” in global institutions, and when actors conceive that entity as best comprehended with knowledge-based understandings.  Additionally, national receptor sites – which serve as intermediaries between world society and domestic actors – show a positive and significant role in the cross-sectional analyses, while centralized state control over the university sector and organizational inertia within the university prove negative and significant throughout.  The overall findings strongly validate our world-society perspective.
0	Developing a sense of transparency and positionality is complex and unsettling within a contemporary social structure that still accommodates traditional binary understandings of race, class, and gender.  Our poster session will address the complexities of attempting to reach a Participatory Action Research utopian space through theorizing and discussion of literature.  We will discuss the challenges we face as budding researchers within societal structures and positionalities that are inherently unequal as we begin our research careers within urban spaces.  We will consider the questions raised about possible research utopias such as PAR and whether or not PAR space can be truly emancipatory since it exists within the broader scope of an unequal society.
0	In this paper I examine the effect of women's and their husbands' attitudes toward contraceptive methods on their fertility limiting behavior. Drawing from Fishbein and Ajzen's theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior, I hypothesize that individuals' perceptions of contraceptive availability, effectiveness, and potential negative side-effects will influence their subsequent method use, and that husbands' attitudes toward contraceptive methods will have significant influence on their wives' method use. Using unique data from Nepal, preliminary analyses reveal significant effects of wives' attitudes on subsequent contraceptive use, but no significant effects of husbands' attitudes.
0	Past research has typically focused on educational outcomes such as attainment and achievement to understand the extent to which immigrant youth are keeping up with their native peers.  In this paper, we analyze patterns of school-sponsored extracurricular activity participation, an understudied aspect of the schooling process which can provide insights into the extent to which immigrant youth are building valued social and cultural capital within their schooling environments.  We view extracurricular activities as key avenues for immigrant youth to interact with native youth, learn social norms and skills, and build valued competencies.  Drawing upon segmented assimilation theory and the frog pond hypothesis, we examine whether immigrant and second-generation youth participate in activities at higher levels in school contexts where they are surrounded by peers who are similar in terms of racial, ethnic and socioeconomic background.  Using a nationally-representative sample of adolescents, we find that participation in school clubs and sports varies by race and immigrant generation, and that the effect of school context varies by race, which has important implications for our understanding of immigrant integration.
0	This paper is based on the analysis of the discourses of three trials of African American men accused of the murder of their minor children.  The  three trials occurred within a single span of time when the Abner Louima case of police brutality and torture was unfolding in New York City. The paper reveals how the shared knowledge of  police brutality towards racial minorities was deployed by the defendants as a defense strategy and then analyzes legal and ethical problematics  of such defense.  Since crimes against children usually involve strong forensic evidence as well as the voluntary taped confession by the defendants it is surprising that the claims of an improperly and forcibly extracted confession could represent an effective legal strategy. Yet. the macro-context of racism in the criminal justice system and the more micro context of the local community relations, make the claims of the defendants plausible even without putting to question the evidence against them. This plausibility of the defendants claims in view of very strong evidence against them raises important questions regarding broader issues of human rights of the defendants as well as the concrete issues of justice for children.  As this paper demonstrates the discourse of the prosecution presenting mostly forensic evidence and the discourse of defense claiming  coerced confessions are engaged in the unproductive tension rather then in the genuine truth-discovery process a criminal trial is supposed to represent.
0	This paper focuses on how unprotected anal sex presents a particular conflict within the current safer-sex paradigm. Safer-sex discourses regard it as a sexual practice solely within the gay male population and men who have sex with men (MSM). HIV prevention campaigns, medical personnel, and public discussions typically fail to recognize heterosexual teens and married couples as engaging in unprotected anal intercourse, which perpetuates the recurrent erroneous association of men who have sex with men (MSM) with “unsafe” anal sex. This paper examines the broader safer-sex paradigms, academic literature, statistics from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) discourse about just what is “barebacking” (condomless anal sex) and who exactly is engaging in it, and how different social institutions view this sexual practice as problematic.
0	"This paper examines the marketing and selling of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non Violent Social Change by the Brand Atlanta Campaign--a public/private partnership that seeks to market Atlanta's past to tourists, while paradoxically projecting an image of ""nowness""--more specifically, a post civil rights Atlanta in which race is no longer an issue--to business interests. The tension between the forward looking face of business and remembrance highlight how the tourist industry creates and maintains site of consumption and raises important questions about the use of King's legacy by competing interests.  King's dream of political and economic parity has been rearticulated in terms of consumption and the accumulation of wealth as a measure of racial progress.  This is done by packaging and selling a sanitized version of history in which we have ""arrived.  Capitalism is thus presented as a curative for racism."
0	Categorization is a complex cultural phenomenon that is central to many aspects of social life. In recent years findings from cognitive science have played an increasingly important role in the sociological analysis of culture and categorization. A result of this research is that Emile Durkheim’s classic theory on the relationship between society and cultural categorization no longer seems viable. This article, then, uses findings from cognitive science to develop an empirically-based framework for understanding social categorization. In particular, I focus on understanding the innate capabilities that humans have for category acquisition. I begin my analysis by discussing the beneficial role that findings from cognitive science can play in contributing to the sociological analysis of culture. Next, I provide an overview of the predominant sociological theories of culture and category acquisition. Finally, I review studies from cognitive science that describe how innate cognitive mechanisms shape category acquisition and use these findings to generate twenty theoretical propositions about category acquisition. The purpose of this exercise is to provide an empirically-based theoretical framework that can be used to evaluate sociological claims about category acquisition, as well as to provide a springboard for future research on culture and categorization.
1	This study combines data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with data from four censuses to examine the effects of foreign-born populations in the immediate and surrounding neighborhoods of residence on native-born black and white householders' residential mobility decisions. We find that the likelihood of out-mobility for native householders is significantly and positively associated with the relative size of, and increases in, the immigrant population in a neighborhood. Consistent with theoretical arguments related to the distance dependence of mobility, large concentrations of immigrants in surrounding areas reduce native out-mobility, presumably by reducing the attractiveness of the most likely mobility destinations. A sizable share of local immigration effects can be explained by the mobility-related characteristics of native-born individuals living in immigrant-populated areas, but the racial composition of a neighborhood (for native whites) and local housing-market conditions (for native blacks) are also important mediating factors. We discuss the implications of these patterns for processes of neighborhood change and broader patterns of residential segregation.
1	Sociologists have long sought to understand the relationship between collective experiences and individual commitments. This article examines the short-term mission as an institutionalized religious experience, assessing its prevalence, predictors and impact on the religions trajectories of the youth who participate in them. Religiously devout adolescents are more likely than others to go on a short-term mission as are younger adolescents and those with very religious parents. Applying propensity score matching to a nationally representative longitudinal sample of American adolescents, we find that adolescents who go on a short-term mission between interview waves report increased religious participation and solidified religious beliefs. We use the example of this experience to emphasize the importance of considering religious experiences to develop more nuanced understandings of the way religion shapes the beliefs and behaviors of individuals.
0	Contemporary sociologists broadly apply the term “network” to describe the kind of organizational form through which meanings are produced, yet the term is often used without theory of what this organizational form is and how it works.   This paper traces several tracts of thinking about networks — from group actions (Blumer 1969), to the production of culture, (Peterson 1976a), cultural capital (Bourdieu ([1979]1984) and social capital (Putnam 2000), to a contemporary form for business (Podolny and Page 1998)—then outlines the ideal types of a “local art production networks” formed by shared interests among art producers who function outside institutional or market contexts.
0	After China’s urban housing reform in the late 1980s, the massive transfer of housing property rights and urban restructuring have created intense conflicts and a proliferation of homeowners associations (HAs, yezhu weiyuanhui) across neighborhoods. Based on a two-year field research conducted in Guangdong Province, this article explores the establishment, development and conflicts of HAs in urban China. By retrieving three dimensions (the significance of society, market and the state; power relations; and social capital) from the theoretical evolution of civil society, this research argues that one essential mechanism for building civil society is through the formation of network relations, instead of market or hierarchical relations among civic organizations and other parties. Given that the significance of this argument is unfolding with the intellectual growth over civil society literature but has not been explicitly considered in existing studies, this study systematically examines organizational relations in neighborhood governance. Chinese homeowners respond to persistent problems in urban space and fiscal arrangements by civic engagement in neighborhood governance, which can lead to a reorientation of relations in neighborhood governance and subsequently promote the rise of civil society in China and other authoritarian regimes.
1	Religious participation is linked to overall satisfaction among both married and unmarried couples in urban America. Less is known about what may account for the association between religious participation and relationship quality. We explore this issue using data from the first two waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Relationship-related behaviors (e.g., temperance) and relationship-specific behaviors (e.g., affection) can each account for the association between church attendance and relationship quality. Furthermore, religious participation appears to be more tightly linked to men's perceptions of relationship quality than women's.

The study explores the ways in which a loosely structured community, the Solidarity Sing Along, has formed around a musical vigil for labor and civil rights that has taken place at the Wisconsin Capitol every weekday for more than nine months.  Drawing on literature from sociology and communication studies to explore the following research broad research question:  How do the underlying values and beliefs of a new social movement reflect the historical values and beliefs of older social movements, and exist across the community’s membership?   This study explores values and beliefs that emerge through deep analysis of the Solidarity Sing Along community as expressed in the texts they produce, by their members in interviews, in their performances in public space, and in their collaborative and community-building use of new media. The research is based on 11 in-depth interviews with core participants, leaders, newcomers, and one interview with a political office-holder, as well as ethnographic participant observation of the weekdaily sing along for three months from October 6 thru December 12, 2011.  The paper advances the understanding of how new social movement participants evaluate the effectiveness of their organizations in raising public understanding for a cause and creating meaningful social change, and connect to other social movements, past and present.
1	In contrast to recent US studies showing a decrease in core network size, our Kenyan data reveals substantial network growth. We attribute this to the diffusion of mobile telephones. Results from pooled survey data from Nairobi professionals and entrepreneurs in 2002 and 2007 as well as qualitative interviews from 2007 to 2009 show virtual saturation in the diffusion of phones during this period, but no direct effect of technology use. What explains this puzzle is a network effect of mobile telephony: increased technological access to existing networks in a context of resource scarcity leads to a strengthening of weak ties and the enhancement of core networks among Kenyans. Video ethnographic data before and after the 2007 post-election unrest supports this interpretation, showing that mobile phones are a crucial resource in managing interpersonal networks for instrumental purposes. 
1	In this study we examine whether and why human and social resources increase charitable giving. Using the Giving in The Netherlands Panel Study 2003, we find that people with more extended networks and higher education are more generous. However, these effects can be completely explained by financial resources, church attendance, requests for donations, and prosocial personality characteristics. People with more extended social networks are mainly more generous because they receive more solicitations for donations, and are more integrated in extended religious networks that promote charitable giving. The generosity of people with higher formal education can be explained by their larger financial resources, and stronger verbal abilities. Whereas the effect of education seems mainly causal, that of network extension appears largely spurious.
0	The classical model of migration posits that family goals, family constraints, and socio-economic status affect rural women’s choices for migration. Analysts typically examine two migration paths – migration for employment and migration for marriage and do not consider education as a path of migration. Researchers often assume rural women express agency only by choosing from these limited set of options. I contribute to this model by asking young rural women how they make decisions about migration, and who they turn to for advice about migration strategy. I collected 42 interviews with women of high, middle, and low SES status from one village in North China from 2007-2008; I find that these women describe education as a major migration option, and describe themselves as playing a more active role in choosing whether and how to migrate than do recent studies. My results highlight how women explain why family members, teachers, and peers influence their decisions and strategies. The mechanisms outlined by Chinese women are useful for understanding how young women in other developing countries may tap into different social networks for capital to make more informed decisions about education migration and upward social mobility.
0	This paper explores problems of male friendship through a social and historical perspective. I argue that within a reflexive and diversifying culture, our identity based sex-gender system is confronting its own limitations within the realm of friendship. Sexual diversity has initiated a new scrutiny of male friendship generally, and has carried with it a unique way to understand the unstable elements of friendship from a historical perspective. This historical view does not suppose a return to some golden age of male friendship, but rather offers a way to understand the potential of a more protean and undefined view of friendship that resists stable identity categories and preconceived notions of gender and sexuality.
0	Every year, and increasing number of Mexican parents make the difficult decision to migrate abroad without their children.  Many times, family separation is strategic: parents migrate to enhance their ability to accumulate family resources and pay for childrens schooling.  In this paper, I explore whether this means for investing in childrens future ultimately bears fruit to parents and childrens hopes and expectations.  I draw on interviews and ethnographic data with parents in the US, and children and caregivers living in Mexico, as well as interviews with school administrators and teachers and surveys with school students in the lower Mixteca region of Oaxaca, Mexico.  I find a disjuncture between the goals of international migration and educational performance of children left behind.  The failure of this strategy is two-fold.  First, both mothers and fathers migration has emotional consequences for children in Mexico, which bleed into school performance.  Second, in some communities, migration pressures have created a crisis for schools educating children who consider work in el norte as the most lucrative option for their future.  Thus, while parents are well intentioned, the combination of school environment and family dynamics in transnational households makes international migration an unsuccessful strategy for investing in childrens education.
1	Drawing on the embeddedness, varieties of capitalism and macrosociological life course perspectives, we examine how institutional arrangements affect network-based job finding behaviors in the United States and Germany. Analysis of cross-national survey data reveals that informal job matching is highly clustered among specific types of individuals and firms in the United States, whereas it is more ubiquitous in Germany. These differences are linked to (1. loosely regulated and hierarchical employment relations in the United States that facilitate network dominance in specific economic sectors and (2. coordinated market relations, tight employment regulations and extensive social insurance system in Germany that generate opportunities for informal matching but limit the influence of network behavior on employment characteristics. These findings illustrate how social institutions shape access to economic resources through network relations.
1	In this article we probe the interplay between public and private music consumption using a large-scale survey of the Flemish population in Belgium We analyze whether public and private music consumption have different correlates and to what extent there is convergence between the genres that people listen to at home and at concerts Results show that music consumption is positively related to all indicators of cultural capital educational attainment, enrolment in arts classes and public participation of the parents The effects are strongest for high-brow genres such as classical and opera and diminish for middle-brow and low-brow genres such as world/traditional music or pop/rock Cultural capital is more important for public participation than for private consumption This suggests that not only information processing capacity is involved when attending concerts, but also social barriers such as familiarity with the rules of decorum and network homophily Omnivorousness in music consumption is especially situated in the private sphere
1	We examine whether sex of child affects parents' beliefs about traditional gender roles. Using an improved methodological approach that explicitly analyzes the natural experiment via differences in differences, we find that having a daughter (vs. having a son) causes men to reduce their support for traditional gender roles, but a female child has no such effect among women, representing less than 4 percent of the size of the standard deviation of the attitude scale.
0	This paper addresses how transnational advocacy networks (TAN) work in an authoritarian context by examining recent activism surrounding the proposed Nu River hydropower dam in China.  The case presents the first evidence that TAN are effective inside China.  The effectiveness, moreover, is achieved without resort to the Boomerang Pattern, the prevailing theory by which such networks achieve their goals in an authoritarian context.  The case also suggests that political opportunity structures (POS), a concept largely developed to examine movement outcomes in democratic political settings, arewith modificationvaluable in non-Western authoritarian contexts.  The author identifies key variables that help to assess the effects of domestic POS on transnational network activism in a repressive authoritarian context.  These are: (1) the degree of state vulnerability; (2) the states capacity and propensity for repression; and (3) the presence or absence of elite allies.  Given the repressive states low vulnerability to anti-dam activism, activists framed issues in terms of compliance with the law in order to take advantage of the states high vulnerability to its own official political principles.  Newly empowered political elites in the State Environmental Protection Administration allied with activists to bring the dam project into the public discourse.
1	National context may influence sex segregation of household tasks through both pragmatic decision making and the normative context in which decision making is embedded. This study utilizes 36 time use surveys from 19 countries (spanning 1965-2003) combined with original national-level data in multilevel models to examine household task segregation. Analyses reveal that men do less and women do more time-inflexible housework in nations where work hours and parental leave are long. Women do less of this work where there is more public child care and men are eligible to take parental leave. National context affects the character of gender inequality in the home through individual- and national-level pathways.
0	The problem of cooperation has not yet been effectively addressed by sociology. Indeed, although much literature has been devoted to the subject, there exists considerable ambiguity regarding the origins and maintenance of cooperation over time. Central to the controversy is the problem of free-riders. In this paper, I briefly review the problem of cooperation, and assess the current explanations from a variety of perspectives. I conclude that all extant theories of cooperation share in common one untenable assertion that prevents satisfactory resolution to the problem of cooperation. I propose an alternative, and construct a mathematical model to demonstrate the possibility and utility of this new theoretical paradigm.
1	New Zealand has experienced a marked increase in immigration since the early 1990s, which has fostered greater ethnic diversity. However, little is known about the changing patterns of spatial differentiation among ethnic groups. Using the New Zealand Census data from 1991 to 2006, we examine the patterns of Asian, Maori, and Pacific people residential segregation from the majority European population. We then assess the effects of ethnic group and geographic level characteristics on the levels of segregation. The results reveal that Pacific people are the most segregated group from Europeans. The levels of segregation have declined only slightly for Maori and Pacific people over time. but increased gradually for Asians. While results show general support for spatial assimilation theory, different sets of factors were found to be associated with levels of segregation for each ethnic minority group. 
1	The welfare reform bill adopted in 1996 limited the eligibility of immigrants on federal funding for welfare use, while vesting states with the authority to create new state-funded substitute benefits for immigrants. This paper capitalizes on this inter-state variation in state welfare rules regarding new immigrants and estimates a triple difference-in-difference estimator that provides evidence on the impact of removing public assistance on Mexican immigrants' infant mortality rates. Using the US linked birth and infant death cohort files from 1995 to 1996 and from 1999 to 2002, I find that infant mortality rates have decreased at a slower rate among children of low-educated Mexican immigrant women compared to their native Mexican-origin counterparts, especially for those mothers residing in less affluent metropolitan counties within their own state. These findings suggest that there may be unintended social costs associated with the Personal Responsibility Work Opportunity and Reconciliation Act, resulting in disparate impact on immigrant mothers and infants. 
1	This study examines the influence of partner relationship quality on childbearing. We are innovative in using relationship quality reports from both partners, drawing on the first and second wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study. Thus, we can identify potential effects of discordant perceptions of the relationship on childbearing. We also pose a new hypothesis on the direction of the effect of relationship quality on fertility, predicting that medium levels of relationship quality result in the highest childbearing rates. Our results indicate that only women's perceptions of relationship quality influence a first birth, whereas women's and men's perceptions affect second births. We do not find unique effects of disagreement in assessments of relationship quality; effects of partners' perceptions are additive. Women reporting medium levels of relationship quality are most likely to have a(nother) child, whereas men with medium and high quality relationships are most likely to have a second child. 
0	It is time to move beyond ascriptive and structural accounts of volunteering toward social processes and mechanisms.  Going beyond Tocqueville and neo-Tocquevilleans, volunteering needs a wider view that includes societal, political and activist volunteering.  This paper reshapes Tocquevillean theory and then proposes a two pronged approach.   First, using principles from public opinion research, we focus on volunteering existing in informal networks.  People exist in informal networks of volunteers and non-volunteers with volunteer leaders who provide information and recruit volunteers through a multi-step process.  In these interpretive communities being asked is socially organized.  People from these more active networks also meet non-volunteer communities and challenging volunteer communities that deaden volunteering or suggest that they should be doing something totally different.   Second, volunteering is embedded in three levels the private and civil spheres that consist of the: (1) private sphere of dinner table conversations with friends and family, (2) civil sphere 1 of voluntary associations and organizations, and (3) regulatory sphere of political, media, and economic institutions.   Civil repair and civil adjustment operate vertically within these spheres with voluntary associations that generate volunteering and then social movements that impact on the regulatory sphere to create major and minor changes in society.  Civil degradation and civil diminution are the opposite processes.  Civil maintenance operates horizontally in the private and first civil sphere to provide good works under existing altruistic norms.  The end result makes volunteering a vertical and horizontal process that operates in the civil spheres in both radical and conservative ways.
0	This paper analyzes terrorism experts understandings of their field of expertise, which has been consistently characterized by an overwhelming categorization of the field as unsuccessful.  I show that this rhetoric of failure often centers around the problematic nature of terrorism itself as an object of expert knowledgethus illustrating the intertwined nature of the production of expertise and the production of the concept of terrorism itself.  While this may seem puzzling in light of sociological theories of science and expertise predicting that experts will engage in boundary work, I suggest that the experts rhetoric can be understood as part of a strategy of legitimation.  Although sociological theories of scientific fields do not adequately describe the world of terrorism experts, such theories are influential insofar as they are mobilized as cultural schemas by actors hoping to discipline their field.  However, experts have been able to stabilize and control neither the definition of terrorism, nor the production and legitimation of terrorism expertise itself.  I suggest that this provides a starting point for further inquiries into the operation of terrorism discourse in both the academic and political realms.
1	Few studies of social movement political success investigate the strategic and tactical approaches used to achieve positive political outcomes. This work investigates a rarely studied mobilization of U. S. women in the first half of the 20th century to explore how movement organizations bring about legal change. Archival data for 15 states are examined to investigate how women won the right to sit on juries. The authors argue that jury movement activists engaged in strategic adaptation were more likely to win a change in jury laws rapidly. Those not engaged in such strategic action won their reforms more slowly. The authors suggest that when social movement actors tailor their actions to respond to exigencies in the environment they are more likely to expedite political success.
0	Although classical sociological theory conceptualized the boundary between work and home as both coterminous with capitalism or modernity and as increasingly impermeable small businesses continue to depend on family labor and capital. A case in point is hairstyling: small businesses dominate the sector and there is significant use of family labor. Furthermore because hairstyling skills are almost universally exchangeable and can be employed in extra-work environments many hairstylists experience instances of work spilling into family life. Thus the boundary is breached in two directions. This paper conceives of the boundary between home and work as multidimensional (with core dimensions of temporality, spatiality, personnel (or social relations), tasks, and rationalities) and empirically specifies the circumstances when it is breached. It is argued that particular dimensions are reinforced or weakened where workers are in different structural positions (trainee; employee; self-employed; business-owner) and (related) where the structural organization of the workplace (the salon) varies. Additionally, the multidimensionality of the home-work boundary means that breaching across one or more dimension can coexist with ongoing ideological valorization of the boundary. Data is from the authors survey of salons and barbershops in a UK city (N=132) and semi-structured interviews with 70 stylists in 52 workplaces.
0	Sexuality has been a neglected topic in many introductory sociology textbooks. However, some more recent texts have begun to address the topic. Our study addresses first the amount of coverage of sexuality in our initial sample of 38 introductory textbooks published after 2000.  We focus specifically on the content of 10 textbooks containing chapters devoted to sexuality.  Our findings reveal attention to a sociological perspective through numerous cross-cultural and historical examples.  Chapters also devote attention to the impact of gender although there is less consistency with regards to material on class and race/ethnicity.  While there is considerable inclusion of homosexuality generally, there is still a lingering heteronormativity as well as homogenization of homosexuality.  The majority of chapters do not explicitly apply theory to sexuality, although all chapters take time to explain sexual identity.  In regards to the sex industry and the media, authors often only offer one perspective. We offer some suggestions to instructors on how to supplement these chapters in their introductory courses.
1	Drawing on structural racism and urban disadvantage approaches, this article posits a broad influence of citywide racial residential segregation on levels of violent crime across all urban neighborhoods regardless of their racial/ethnic composition. Multilevel models based on data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study for 7,622 neighborhoods in 79 cities throughout the United States reveal that segregation is positively associated with violent crime for white and various types of nonwhite neighborhoods. Nonetheless, there is a lack of parity in violence across these types of communities reflecting the larger racialized social system in which whites are able to use their privileged position to reside in the most advantaged neighborhoods, while African-Americans and Latinos live in the most disadvantaged urban communities and therefore bear the brunt of urban criminal violence.
1	A number of studies document a negative relationship between adolescent sexual intercourse and high school educational experiences and outcomes; yet, this research risks conflating the consequences associated with sex in romantic relationships with those that result when sex occurs in other relationship contexts. We predict that, compared to abstinence, intercourse in romantic relationships will have limited consequences for education, whereas the negative effects associated with sex in other relationships will be pronounced. We evaluate our hypothesis with two waves of data on nine measures of educational experiences and outcomes from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our results are generally consistent with our predictions: the context in which sexual activity occurs substantially moderates the relationship between sexual intercourse and several education measures. These findings contradict the claims some abstinence-only curricula make regarding the link between adolescent sex and a plethora of negative outcomes. We speculate that such programs reinforce the notion that sex, and in particular sex that occurs in nonromantic relationships, is counternormative. As a result, they may needlessly increase the risk that some sexually active adolescents will have negative educational experiences and outcomes.
1	"Using data from 7272 adolescent US girls, we explore how girls' race/ethnic group status affects their bodyweight, perceptions of overweight, and weight control practices. We hypothesize that a girl's race/ethnic status influences her basic identity which in turn prompts her to adopt or reject a ""drive for thinness."" After controlling for family and peer support, school engagement, family SES, maturation, and family structure, we find that girls' race/ethnic status influences their susceptibility to the thinness ideals of mainstream culture. African American girls weigh more than Asian. Hispanic, or White girls, but at any given weight they perceive themselves as overweight and attempt to control their weight less. Asian American and White girls invest most in thinness dynamics. Some evidence also suggests girls from lower SES families are less driven to be thin. Our results affirm the utility of viewing material bodies as ""situations"" that are experienced and interpreted in accord with identity group relations and dynamics. Published by Elsevier Inc."
0	The post socialist transformation in Hungary was a period of both persistence and change in territorial inequality. Persistence is the dominant pattern, and it appears to be associated with the location of FDI.  We show that while dependence on FDI is uniform throughout the nations 20 counties, only certain areas have been able to use FDI  to improve the quality of employment and resulting remuneration.  We show that inter-area differences in the amount and types of FDI are associated with persisting differences in territorial well being, and with instances where localities either advance or decline in their material level of living. We asked whether the leading sector framework is a fruitful theoretical perspective for examining uneven spatial development within countries during the post socialist transformation, and we conclude that it is.   Similar to FDI location between countries, international investors are hesitant to redistribute their capital toward lagging regions within ex-socialist countries. We believe that global investors will continue to favor local economies that have similar supply structures to their home economies. Hence,lagging regions continue to lag because investors avoid areas that are structurally different, but they are structurally different because of a lack of FDI. The systems logic implies that lagging regions will hardly ever recover because their own efforts, and their national governments development policies, are simply too weak in comparison with the power of deregulated capital in the global system.
0	Contemporary congregation-based community organizing (CBCO) makes an important contribution to participatory democracy by developing innovative interpersonal relationships of mutual support and accountability. While past movements have found such forms to be fragile and exclusive, democratic relationships in CBCO are sustainable and inclusive. CBCO groups achieve this by teaching specific relational and organizational practices, and supporting them with a rich organizational culture. Relational organizing, however, may deepen tensions inherent in participatory democracy. Public sociology can create a dialogue with activists around these key issues, furthering scholarship and practice.
1	Little is known about the language acquisition of refugees in Western countries. This study examines how pre- and post-migration characteristics of refugees are related to their second language proficiency. Data are from a survey of 3,500 refugees, who were born in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, former Yugoslavia and Somalia, and who resided in the Netherlands. The analysis shows that speaking and reading skills are better among refugees who received more pre-migration schooling, who migrated from a major city, and who arrived in the host country at a younger age. Post-migration characteristics are also important. Language skills are better among refugees who only lived in a refugee reception center for a short while, who completed an integration course, who received post-migration education, who intend to stay in the host country, and who have fewer health problems.
1	The study investigates the influences of women's attitudes about gender and couples' housework allocation patterns on women's employment status and work hours across the life course. The influence of these factors on the employment characteristics of continuously married women is investigated at four time points: 1977, 1980, 1985, and 1993. Data come from the Intergenerational Panel Study of Parents and Children and the analysis sample includes 556 continuously married women. Findings from structural equation, fixed effects, and tobit models offer consistent evidence of long-term positive influences of women's egalitarian gender ideology and men's participation in routine housework on women's labor force participation. The results provide evidence of a process of lagged adaptation through which wives' employment patterns are responsive to individual and couple characteristics over long intervals of time.

0	This article is based on a study on a random sample of 108 internally displaced persons (IDP) camps – one in eight in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area – conducted during July-August, 2010. This article discusses how international development agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) failed to secure the human rights to water and health for all of Haiti’s 1.5 million IDPs. Among other indicators, 30 percent of IDP camps had no toilets, and 40 percent had no access to water. This lack of sanitation services created a prime breeding ground for cholera, killing over 2,700 people two months following its initial outbreak.
0	This paper presents an up-to-date study on economic return to investment in human capital among working married women in Hong Kong. We simultaneously consider their decision on labor force participation. That is, the earnings function is corrected for women's self-selection into wage-earning jobs. We expand the existing literature by examining changes in the earnings function for married women before and after the sovereignty handover in 1997. In particular, our study aims to shed new light upon the roles played by such factors as family role constraints and thus selectivity in affecting married women's economic return to human capital in the labor market. Drawing on data from 1996 and 2006 Hong Kong census/by-census, we estimate earnings functions for married women with human capital measures, such as schooling, work experience, and English skill, as key predictors. As to selection process, we consider the influences of family role constraints, indicated by presence of young children and husband's income, and availability of domestic helper. Estimates from two years are compared.
0	Research indicates that while acculturation is a powerful determinant of self-rated health (Johnson, Carroll, Fulda, Cardarelli, & Cardarelli, 2010), its relationship to physical health is still not well understood, particularly among immigrants living in the United States (Lara, Gamboa, Kahramanian, Morales, & Bautista, 2005). We develop a comprehensive physical health index which reflects BMIand the presence of chronic health conditions and diseases and evaluate acculturation’s relationship tothis index. We perform a series of cross-sectional analyses of data from the 2000 to 2005 of National Health Interview Study (NHIS) using the Complex Samples module of SPSS 19.0 to account for the stratified multistage probability design of the NHIS. It is hypothesized that acculturation is a stronger predictor of physical health as compared to self-reported health.We compare the relationship of acculturation to self-reported health with the relationship of acculturation to physical health. Findings reveal that acculturation is a significant predictor of both self-rated health and physical health among immigrants in the United States. A stronger association was established between acculturation and physical health (McFadden Pseudo R2: .086-.116). These results reinforce arguments for the use of measures that combine several dimensions of physical health status in immigrant health research.
1	Our paper examines service usage (e.g., shelter) as well as a typology of individuals who are most likely to use groupings of services among 249 homeless youth. Our results revealed that the majority of homeless young people have used food programs (66%) and street outreach (65%) on at least one occasion within the past year. Cluster analysis of services revealed four distinct groups: (1) basic survival service use, characterized by above average shelter, food, and outreach service use, but below average on counseling, substance abuse/mental health services, and incarceration; (2) multiple service use, which included above average use of all six services; (3) incarceration experience, characterized by above average incarceration experience, but below average use of all other five services; and (4) minimal service use, which included slightly above average use of counseling, but below average use of all other services. These findings have the potential to provide important information that may assist with targeting services to homeless youth. 
1	In the 1990s, many immigrants bypassed established gateways like Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Miami to create new immigrant destinations across the US. In this paper, we examine how segregation and spatial assimilation might differ between established gateways and new destinations among the 150 largest metropolitan areas. Using data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses, we calculate levels of dissimilarity for Hispanics and Asians by nativity for these two gateway types. Our findings show that segregation levels are consistently lower in new destinations. However, Hispanics in new destinations experienced significant increases segregation during the 1990s, suggesting a convergence in residential patterns by destination type. Nevertheless, in both destinations the native-born are less segregated than the foreign born-consistent with immigrant spatial incorporation. Finally, socioeconomic indicators are generally consistent with predictions of spatial assimilation. 
1	The relative numbers of women and men are changing dramatically in China, but the consequences of these imbalanced sex ratios have received little empirical attention. We merge data from the Chinese Health and Family Life Survey with community-level data from Chinese censuses to examine the relationship between cohort- and community-specific sex ratios and women's partnering behavior. Consistent with demographic-opportunity theory and sociocultural theory, we find that high sex ratios (indicating more men relative to women) are associated with an increased likelihood that women marry before age 25. However, high sex ratios are also associated with an increased likelihood that women engage in premarital and extramarital sexual relationships and have more than one sexual partner, findings consistent with demographic-opportunity theory but inconsistent with sociocultural theory.
1	This article examines the causes of financial malfeasance in the largest U.S. corporations between 1995 and 2004. The findings support organizational-political embeddedness theory, which suggests that differential social structures create dependencies, incentives, and opportunities to engage in financial malfeasance. The historical analysis shows that neoliberal policies enacted between 1986 and 2000 resulted in organizational and political structures that permitted managers to engage in financial malfeasance. Our quantitative analysis provides three main findings. First, capital dependence on investors creates incentives to engage in financial malfeasance. Second, managerial strategies to increase shareholder value create incentives to engage in financial malfeasance. Third, the multilayer-subsidiary form and the political structure permitting corporate PAC contributions create opportunities to engage in financial malfeasance. These findings have important implications for public policy; the corporate and state structures enacted in the late-twentieth century were the outcome of a long-term, well-financed, and systematic political strategy that provided managers with unprecedented power, autonomy, and opportunity to engage in financial malfeasance.
0	This paper uses the case of the Norse Greenlanders, who lived in Greenland from 985-c. 1450 during a period of significant climatic change, to explore the role of ideological rigidity  the inflexible attachment to a particular world view  as a constraint on human adaptation. Through an examination of the social and economic bases of Norse Greenland society, the emergence of a variety of stresses (both internally and externally generated) to that system and the reaction to them, the case suggests that mental models of the world channel the way a culture reacts to stress. Rather than abandoning those models as the stress continues to worsen, the culture may respond by elaborating and reinforcing the dysfunctional world view. Even at the maximum possible price, the death of the culture. Parallels between this societal level process and the dynamics of the smaller system disasters discussed by Perrow (1984) are explored.
1	Using a sample of 42,329 respondents nested within 4254 Canadian urban neighborhoods, this study demonstrates the conceptual and empirical importance of making a distinction between neighborhood racial diversity and minority concentration. and examines how each is uniquely associated with trust. Our analysis shows that at a given level of racial minority concentration, Whites are more trusting when their minority neighbors are more evenly distributed across racial minority groups. Meanwhile, Whites are less trusting as the neighborhood share of racial minorities increases. Overall, the effect of racial minority concentration tends to prevail over that of racial diversity. 
0	Students at two state universities were surveyed to determine whether those who had an academic ethic in high school performed better in college than students who did not possess an academic ethic in high school.  This paper also assesses the perceived helpfulness of a variety of factors (first-year seminar, freshman orientation, parents, peers, high school teachers and guidance counselors, college professors, etc.) in the transition experience of students from high school to college.  Latinos were less likely to find first-year seminar helpful than both whites and blacks, and in terms of gender parents and college professors were a more important influence on the transition to college for Latinas than Latinos.  Latinos were more likely to possess an academic ethic in high school than whites, but not in college. Latinos who possessed an academic ethic in high school and college did not have significantly higher GPAs than those who did not possess an academic ethic.  In terms of gender, there were no significant differences between Latinas and Latinos regarding GPA or the possession of an academic ethic in high school or college.  Important differences were also found between first-generation and second-generation college students.  Implications of the findings for future research and policy are discussed.
1	"Recent studies report significant cross-national variation in the conceptual distinctions or ""symbolic boundaries"" used by majority groups to construct notions of ""us"" and ""them."" Because this literature compares only a handful of countries, the macro-level forces by which certain symbolic boundaries become more salient than others remain poorly understood. This article provides the first panorama of these processes by comparing the relative salience or ""configuration"" of multiple symbolic boundaries in 21 European countries. I use fuzzy-set analyses of data from the 2003 European Social Survey to create a typology of symbolic boundary configurations. The results indicate that the symbolic boundaries deployed by the general public do not correspond to the official ""philosophies of integration"" emphasized in the literature. Moreover the data suggest previous comparisons have focused too heavily on Western Europe, overlooking important variation in other regions of Europe where immigration began more recently. I generate hypotheses to explain this newfound variation using demographic, socioeconomic, institutional, and historical data from quantitative and qualitative sources. The article concludes with examples of how these hypotheses can be combined by future studies toward a theory of ""boundary-work."""
0	Community service learning offers students the opportunity to enhance their learning by linking classroom knowledge with real world experiences.  Part of this process involves students crossing societal borders of differential power and privilege where they come into contact with groups of people who are different from themselves.  Using student writings and interviews, this paper explores the impact of these border crossing experiences in a peer facilitated community service learning program at the University of Michigan.  We focus on how peer facilitators address the experiences students have at community service sites, the interactions between and among students and peer facilitators in the classroom, and how to better realize the benefits of border crossing in community service learning courses.  Our findings suggest that community service learning creates border crossing experiences that encourage students to reflect on their own social group identity and position within the larger social structures of privilege and oppression.
0	Skateboarding is an increasingly popular activity among teenagers, especially among boys. But skateboarding in public space disrupts the urban order, as it is an unintended use of space shared by others in the community. Studies have approached teen skateboarding from various perspectives including subculture, postmodern geography, sport, and gender. This ethnographic study of street skating among suburban teenagers explores the ways in which a suburban community regulates skateboarding in public places, and how teenage skaters negotiate the constraints imposed upon their activities. I find that a suburban community attempts to regulate and control skateboarding activities by building a skate park, implementing prohibitive devices, making skateboarding in public spaces illegal, and monitoring activities. The examination of the skateboarders tactics of overcoming such constraints shows their ability to relocate their activity and continue to maintain certain level of autonomy over where and how they skate. The study concludes that space, time and the way space is used determine the types of regulation on a public behavior, and whether such attempts are successful.
1	New Immigrant Survey 2003 data are used to consider the intersection between self- and other's assessments of English proficiency. Our findings yield two important results. First, individuals who over- or under-estimate their English proficiency experience worse labor market outcomes than those whose positive self-evaluations coincide with the interviewer's. Second, our analysis of respondents with a concordant self and interviewer assessment suggests higher returns to English proficiency than when using self-assessment. We argue that, although self-assessed language proficiency dominates the literature on immigrants' well-being, this measure omits an important additional factor concerning immigrant self-perception and its concordance with the perceptions of others. 
0	Using detailed data from the National Science Foundation on commercial participation among doctoral recipients in four scientific disciplines and three employment sectors, I investigate rates of commercial involvement among male and female scientists and changes in their involvement over time.  Descriptive data describe the landscape of current commercial activity, while multivariate models provide evidence to distinguish between important predictors of male and female involvement across organizational contexts.  In addition, using two-wave panel data, I also examine whether and how gender and these predictors matter for subsequent involvement in later years, controlling for scientists earlier commercial activity choices. Results suggest that gender operates in different ways across academia and industry settings.  There is not a direct effect of gender on the probability of commercializing in academia rather, gender disparities are created and maintained through other avenues and particular subsets of female scientists within academia.  In particular, women with children appear to be the principally commercially disadvantaged group in the university setting.  Gender disparities in industry, however, remain despite controlling for intervening demographic and career-history variables, although certain work environments appear to be more advantaging to women scientists than others.  Additional models suggest that continued involvement is more a function of exposure, or experience with commercial activity in the past, for both male and female scientists.   Therefore, structural differences and demographics matter for female scientists, but only to set the commercial process going.  I discuss the substantive and policy implications of these results for scientific work practices and careers.
1	"Drawing on original qualitative research, this article investigates how natives and institutions in rural America ""new immigrant destinations"" are adapting, if at all, to Hispanic newcomers and whether corresponding interaction should be viewed as substantively responsive. In contrast to predictions made by traditional political incorporation theories, results based on semi-structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork suggest that Hispanic newcomers are undergoing a process of bureaucratic incorporation whereby public service bureaucrats, rather than elected politicians, are initiating substantive responsiveness. Yet I also identify a continuing interaction between immigrant bureaucratic and political incorporation in rural America. I conclude by connecting my findings to more general sociological perspectives regarding population needs, electoral bodies, and public bureaucracies in democratic societies."
0	Scholarship on the consequences of social movements has grown considerably in recent years.  We examine a classic case in the study of social movements – the sit-ins to desegregate lunch counters by black college students in the early 1960s.  We build on movement infrastructure, political mediation/opportunity, and economic opportunity structure theories highlighting their core propositions and identifying ways in which they complement and diverge from one another.  We provide the first comparative assessment of these theories using a dataset of over 300 cities in the South to explain patterns of desegregation in the two years following the onset of protest.  We find no direct support for the claims of economic opportunity structure proponents and minimal support for the political opportunity argument.  Instead, we find that student protest and strong adult organizations are the most important factor shaping desegregation while white segregationist organizations reduce the likelihood of success.
0	Among the diverse types of employment discriminations in China’s labor market, employment opportunity differentials by gender and hukou are two prominent representatives. Previous literatures dealing with the effects of categories of social identity on inequality in the labor market have resolved around whether employment discriminations are interdependent or mutually exclusive. This paper uses the 2003 CGSS and 2006 CGSS to respectively test this debate for women migrant workers, namely, the existence and degree of intersections of gender and hukou on their employment opportunities relative to their comparative-group members, and then goes further to examine trends in employment discrimination against this marginalized group between 2003 and 2006. Methodologically, this paper has improved the conventional approaches of intersectional perspective to measure inequality in the labor market, and in particular, developed a new way for employment opportunities. It is found that in each year women migrant workers suffer greater employment discrimination than those with only one dimension of identity. This pattern becomes more distinct in 2006 than in 2003. These results not only point to the social exclusion result from the unequal distribution of employment opportunities based on ascriptive social identities, but also indicate the nature of the two-tier labor market, a particular representation of labor market segmentation found in Western countries. This phenomenon is implicitly a danger signal of ill or even disaster in contemporary urban Chinese society, which is caused by the economic globalization that involves no globalization of human rights.

This shaped a series of structural transformations in the field that cannot be adequately understood in terms of intellectual orientations or professional ambitions alone. Greater attention to this structural side of this story can lay the groundwork for a more systematic assessment of the extent to which a postwar sociological establishment was able to successfully impose a common set of disciplinary issues, discursive stakes, and evaluative criteria--as some have claimed--thereby paving the way for more detailed considerations of the interplay between dominance and resistance, consensus and fragmentation, integration and heterogeneity, orthodoxy and heterodoxy, in postwar American sociology. To that end, we attempt in this paper to shed more light on the structural transformations of the discipline, especially in the postwar period. We focus in particular on the expansion and differentiation of venues for the production of PhDs.

Throughout the period, the majority of young women lived in extended families with their in-laws.  However, the percent of young women residing in nuclear families did increase from 1992 to 2006.  Contrary to depictions of the daughter-in-law as a position of hardship, young women living in nuclear families do not enjoy greater well-being than those in extended families.  Of the ten well-being outcomes examined, only four differ significantly by family structure.  Further, where there are differences, it is the young women residing in extended families that are better off.  These findings suggest that the trend towards living in nuclear families will have only a very small impact on young women’s well-being, but the impact it does have will be largely harmful.
0	This study examines how the odds of a black renter becoming a homeowner changed during the 1990s, considering significant policy changes aimed at dismantling discriminatory barriers to nonwhite homeownership during that time period and various housing market characteristics, including level of residential segregation.  With data drawn from the geocoded version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, this study employs event history methods in the form of discrete time logit models to capture the dynamics of renter to owner tenure transition.  The results of this study provide both good news and bad news.  The good news is that blacks benefited from the changing home lending environment and were more likely to become homeowners during the 1990s.  This implies that the policy changes had some success.  The bad news is that race still matters.  Relative to whites, blacks were significantly less likely to become homeowners during the study period even after controlling for a variety of factors known to be associated with homeownership.  Interestingly, the data also show that blacks residing in metro areas with the highest levels of racial isolation were significantly more likely to become homeowners than blacks residing in metro areas with the lowest levels of isolation.  The dissimilarity index, however, was not an important predictor of transitioning to homeownership for blacks in this time period.
0	After school programs using a positive youth development (PYD) approach have become an increasingly common feature of the educational landscape.  Because PYD incorporates ideas from developmental discourse and the new childhood studies, it advocates creating both ethnic-neutral and ethnic-specific programs. We analyze two after school programs that implemented a PYD approach to serve a Southeast Asian youth population.  One after school program created an ethnic-specific program, which helped youth to explore their ethnic histories and backgrounds in such a way that youth became empowered to act from a place of ethnic-specific self-knowledge.  The second program adopted an ethnic-neutral approach which empowered youth to exercise agency in relation to technical aspects of leadership, such as planning and leading activities.  How program staff decide to address youths’ racial and ethnic backgrounds has far reaching consequences for the way youth develop leadership skills.
1	This paper examines parallel shifts in late life debt use and retirement behaviors. After discussing the conceptual linkages between credit and labor markets, I use data from the 1992 to 2008 waves of the Health and Retirement Study to examine the temporal patterning of retirement and debt behaviors. I rely on the longitudinal structure of the data to estimate the effects of debt accumulation on retirement behaviors, using alternative specifications to identify treatment and control groups. The findings suggest that debt accumulation in later life has a significant effect on decisions to remain in the workforce in later years. 
0	Although the boy crisis, or the notion that boys are falling behind girls in schools, has been a popular topic in the news for years, few have used a comprehensive approach to explain boys´ academic achievement that includes research on gender theory and adolescent development.  Certain constructions of masculinity, augmented by intersections of race/ethnicity, time and development, and sexuality, may deny some boys the capital needed for high educational achievement.
1	It has often been proposed that new cleavages have emerged within the middle class. In this paper, we examine the distinction between social and cultural specialists and technocrats, and investigate whether these new and old middle class fractions are differentiated by their patterns of intergenerational mobility. To what extent do these newly distinguished middle class fractions have specific external and internal intergenerational mobility patterns? And to what extent have mobility boundaries between them been rising over time? To answer these questions, we use 47 Dutch national population sample surveys with detailed occupation codes collected between 1970 and 2006 (N = 60,978). Our analyses of internal and external homogeneity show that the middle class fractions each have characteristic mobility and immobility patterns and therefore a necessary condition is satisfied to declare them as separate classes. Furthermore, in the early periods, the social and cultural specialists were differentiated by a high level of immobility but in the later periods, the distance between the old and new middle classes has decreased significantly.

1	Despite Civil Rights legislation, racial inequality persists, especially in the context of poverty. This study advances the literature on racial inequality and the Southern legacy of slavery by examining slavery's relationship with inequality in poverty. I analyze county-level U.S. Census data using regression and spatial data analysis techniques. I find the 1860 slave concentration is related to contemporary black-white inequality in poverty, independent of contemporary demographic and economic conditions, racialized wealth disparities and racial threat. My research suggests the importance of slavery for shaping existing U.S. racial inequality patterns. Insights derived from this research, including the formulation of legacy as a place-based, continuous phenomenon that is distinct from racial threat, provide the basis for future research on legacy's mechanisms.
0	Economic sociologists routinely argue that markets are politically constituted, yet beyond such empirical observations little systematic theoretical understanding of the generic political processes of market constitution have emerged.  In this paper I use this historical moment of neoliberalism to develop a theoretical approach to the politics of market reorganization.  I examine a crucial case of market reorganization during this period, the deregulation of the U.S. airline industry.  The historical narrative of this case demonstrates three concepts as central to market reorganization: economic rents, exogenous shocks, and the political environment.  Rents provide an impetus for challengers to mobilize against incumbents and attempt to reorganize markets.  Challengers however frame their mobilization in ways that resonate with the political environment, leading to market reproduction during historical moments of market stability.  However, when exogenous shocks delegitimate the institutions underlying the political environment this enables challengers to construct new frames that resonate with an emerging institutional structure and develop new mobilization networks, potentially leading to market reorganization and a reorganization of the rent distribution.  This model moves beyond the existing theories of markets by better specifying the political process of market reorganization as the outcome of shifting institutional resources and network ties.
1	A key argument of Massey and Denton's (1993) American Apartheid is that racial residential segregation and non-white group poverty rates combine interactively to produce spatially concentrated poverty. Despite a compelling theoretical rationale, empirical tests of this proposition have been negative or mixed. This article develops a formal decomposition model that expands Massey's model of how segregation, group poverty rates, and other spatial conditions combine to form concentrated poverty. The revised decomposition model allows for income effects on cross-race neighborhood residence and interactive combinations of multiple spatial conditions in the formation of concentrated poverty. Applying the model to data reveals that racial segregation and income segregation within race contribute importantly to poverty concentration, as Massey argued. Almost equally important for poverty concentration, however, is the disproportionate poverty of blacks' and Hispanics' other-race neighbors. It is thus more accurate to describe concentrated poverty in minority communities as resulting from three segregations: racial segregation, poverty-status segregation within race, and segregation from high- and middle-income members of other racial groups. The missing interaction Massey expected in empirical tests can be found with proper accounting for the factors in the expanded model.
0	Sociological commentaries on the increased use of scientific knowledge and technology for the maintenance of social control within contemporary society have usually proceeded in one of two ways: either by providing a critique of such resources and their implementation as heightened forms of surveillance; or by offering an analysis of the social processes through which scientific developments are incorporated into the administration of criminal justice. In the spirit of the latter, this paper addresses police uses of molecular biology to support criminal investigations. The paper moves from a theoretical consideration of this issue to an empirical analysis of the use of DNA profiling by the police in the UK, often described as the world-leader in the operation of this technology. We focus in particular on the ways in which DNA is represented in public discourse surrounding the construction of forensic DNA databases in order to show how sociological research can contribute to the wider public debate over contemporary modalities of social control.
0	This paper contributes to the assessment of ecological modernization as an explanation for environmental reform.  I offer a broader synthesis of theoretical perspectives in political science and world polity theory that provides a superior explanation for environmental reform and a wide array of other reforms.  The synthesis also moves us away from the dichotomy between biophysical and cultural causes of reform and refocuses our attention to how institutions structure privilege.
0	In her analysis of the dialectical structure of reproductive consciousness, Mary OBrien argued that the physical labor involved in womens reproductive experiences affirms womens connections with their children and integration into the human species, whereas mens discontinuous experiences negate such connections and integration.  Patriarchy enables the reconciliation of this negation for men, by allowing them to claim ownership of the products of womens reproductive labor.  Drawing on interview data with 18 postpartum women, this paper re-examines OBriens central argument in conjunction with empirical data.  The findings support OBriens assertions that (1) work is viewed by some women as an essential component of childbearing, and (2) childbearing results in a sense of greater connectedness and integration into the human species for some women.  However, women also emphasized the importance of another element of childbearing  an indescribable, in-comprehensible, experiential component  that is missing from OBriens analysis and much feminist literature on reproduction.  It is argued that placing this experiential element of childbearing at the center of feminist work can further our understanding of reproductive experiences and enhance current debates over the appropriate role of men in childbearing.
1	We examine the influence of community context on change over time in households' use of non-wood fuels. Our theoretical framework builds on sociological concepts in order to study energy consumption at the micro-level. The framework emphasizes the importance of nonfamily organizations and services in the local community as determinants of the transition from use of fuelwood to use of alternative fuels. We use multilevel longitudinal data on household fuel choice and community context from rural Nepal to provide empirical tests of our theoretical model. Results reveal that increased exposure to nonfamily organizations in the local community increases the use of alternative fuels. The findings illustrate key features of human impacts on the local environment and motivate greater incorporation of social organization into research on environmental change. 
0	In this paper, I use data from the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) to explore the interconnections among specialization, spouses perceptions of fairness, gender ideologies and marital stability.  Social exchange theory orients my analysis of the effects of specialization on marital stability. I hypothesize that the division of paid and unpaid labor has important consequences for perceptions of fairness in marriage and that these perceptions in turn affect marital stability.  Moreover, I consider how gender ideology might change the relationship between specialization and fairness as well as the relationship between specialization and the risk of divorce.  The results indicate that the division of labor has a small effect on perceptions of fairness and that perceptions of fairness only weakly predict marital stability net of the actual level of specialization in the marriage.  The relationship between the sharing of division of labor and marital stability is not affected by a spouses gender ideology, but gender ideology has offsetting direct effects on marital stability.
1	We used ECLS-K data for White first graders in 1999 to quantitatively test Lareau's [Lareau, Annette, 2003. Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life. University of California Press, Berkeley] theory of the role played by parental concerted Cultivation as a mediator of the positive effect of parental SES on children's school achievement. We measured concerted cultivation using a scale of 29 items, each of which was a parental response to one of the following: perceptions of parental responsibilities towards their child, leisure time activities scheduled for the child, parental relationships with the child's school, and the number of children's books at home. We also included measures of parental educational expectations, the teacher's judgment of the student's school-related effort and organization, and socio-demographic control variables. We used two distinct measures of achievement-reading test scores, and the teacher's judgment of the student's language and literacy skills. In support of Lareau's theory, we found that parental SES is positively and very strongly associated with concerted Cultivation. We also found that concerted cultivation is positively associated with both test scores and the teacher's judgment of student language and literacy skills, and explains a portion of the effect of parental SES on these achievement measures. However, the portion attributable to concerted Cultivation is modest in size. 
0	Inter-organizational forms of collaboration among firms have become increasingly important over the past few decades.  With the exception of notable studies of university and firm relations to further research, development and technology transfer, most of this literature has examined collaboration among entities of a common legal form and purpose.  This research examines how organizational forms from sectors with incommensurable values and structures create a means to collaborate.  With interviews from 75 informants in the open source and free software communities and evaluation of four community managed software projects, I examine how online software development communities negotiated a set of practices and rules for collaborating with firms that included the creation of a boundary institution.  Prior research has shown how boundary objects facilitate shared understanding across cross-cutting communities of expertise, but we know little about boundary institutions.  Boundary institutions have characteristics amenable to both parties that do not violate the foundational features of either.  They are essential to enabling actors from different sectors to substantively and legally engage and provide a means to reconcile divergent and convergent interests.  This research also suggests that the study of boundary institutions may illuminate how alternative logics become integrated or hybridized with dominant logics.
0	The Asian population is heterogeneous, yet many researchers continue to treat Asian American students as if they were a homogeneous ethnic category and overlook the differences within Asian ethnic category. This study explores whether there are between-group differences between Chinese Americans and Non-Chinese Asian Americans in linking parental involvement with student academic achievement.Results of this study indicate that although Chinese students are more academically successful in math, it is not clear whether their academic success can be attributed to certain parental practices. Differences in parenting styles fail to account for the observed ethnic differences between Chinese and Non-Chinese Asian students in math achievement.
0	The purpose of this paper is to reveal the unintended consequences of teamwork and work intensification on family. Based on a qualitative study involving observation and in-depth interviews with 142 workers from a top Japanese auto factory, this paper focuses on the issues of gender, identity transformation of female workers in a male dominated environment, and group processes, and ends with implications of workplace affairs on family. Workers’ personal stories uncover how long-term teamwork sometimes leads to flirting, dating and affairs between team members.  Team intensification also has a consequence of undermining workers’ families especially through an unusually high rate of divorce in the factory.  This impact of high performance work systems on families and marriages is an effect of teamwork that is never mentioned in the literature on teams.
0	Based on five years of faculty-led summer term study abroad programs to Central Europe, the authors report their experiences in preparing, organizing, and leading groups of sociology students on extensive field trips.  The paper focuses on 1) the particular ways that a study abroad program to Central Europe can be effectively used to teach sociological concepts, and 2) the areas of special concern for the university professor who intends to consider preparing such a program.  The authors argue that specific destinations in the Central European region, which includes Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, offer excellent and unique opportunities for teaching sociology.  Topics covered include institutions, social change and modernization, globalization, McDonaldization, social solidarity, social services, gender, politics and parties, diversity, and totalitarianism.  Also discussed is how to create a program, including setting the agenda and planning travel, administrative issues, budgeting, risks, and student evaluation.
1	"Little is known about how influence flows in the academy, because of inherent difficulties in collecting data on large samples of friendship and advice-seeking networks over time. We propose taking advantage of the relative abundance of ""affiliation network"" data to assess aggregate patterns of how individual and dyadic characteristics channel influence among researchers. We formulate and test our approach using new data on 2034 faculty members at Stanford University over a 15-year period, analyzing different affiliations as potential influence channels for changes in grant productivity. Results indicate that research productivity is more malleable to ongoing interpersonal influence processes than suggested in prior research: a strong, salient tie to a colleague in an authority position is most likely to transmit influence, and most forms of influence are likely to spill over to behaviors outside those jointly produced by collaborators. However, the genders and institutional locations of ego-alter pairs significantly affect how influence flows. "
1	Although income inequality in Central and Eastern Europe was considerably lower during socialism than in other countries at comparable levels of development, it increased significantly in all Central and East European states after the fall of communist regimes. However, some of these countries managed to maintain comparatively low inequality levels 10 years into the transition period while inequalities have skyrocketed in others. What explains this variation? This article presents one of the first longitudinal cross-national analyses of the factors that determine changes in income inequality in 10 Central and East European countries during the first decade after 1989 Results suggest that rising Income inequality is principally related to (1. the expansion idle private sector, (2 retrenchment of the redistributive state, (3. the social exclusion of ethno-national minorities, and (4. penetration of foreign capital. Moreover, the analyses suggest that privatization strategies promoting foreign investment created more inequality than those promoting domestic investment. These findings reveal the social, political and cultural foundations of the income inequality dynamic during post-socialist transition in Central and Eastern Europe
0	In this project we ask whether, through what mechanisms, and for whom elementary and secondary school characteristics affect post-secondary educational and occupational attainments.  Do the attributes of elementary and secondary schools have causal effects on later educational and occupational outcomes?  If so, what particular aspects of elementary and secondary schools seem to matter for these outcomes?  Finally, to what extent are any effects of elementary and secondary school characteristics on post-secondary educational and occupational attainments heterogeneous across students with different socioeconomic and other backgrounds?  To address these questions we will use unique data from a large and representative sample of individuals who have been followed from their senior years of high school through age 66 and for whom we have recently obtained detailed data on the attributes of their elementary and secondary schools.

Recognizing that authenticity is not inherent to a person, object, or performance but is instead a dynamic social construction, we argue that racial groups do collective authenticity work and emphasize their uniqueness by deploying the rhetoric and practices of ""tradition.""  People underscore their distinctiveness by describing three categories of practices under the broad framework of tradition: ""roots,"" which includes an emphasis on a homeland, history, and biological heritage; ""values,"" which includes emphasis on the importance of family and social decorum; and ""cultural toolkit,"" which encompasses numerous cultural traits and abilities such as language competence, religion, food, and other ritualized practices."
0	During the past century, scholars have been examining the relationship between marital status and health in a quest to discover why married individuals live healthier lives than singles. Explanations for this relationship take the form of two major arguments – the social selection hypothesis and the social causation hypothesis. Previous studies testing the social selection hypothesis assumed that marriage is a screening process for healthier individuals. The social causation hypothesis emphasized the benefits of being married, not the benefits of remaining unmarried. In societies where remaining single is no longer considered deviant or socially unacceptable, the reasoning that married people are healthier by selection or causation may no longer be valid. Our study uses adult participants in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) in 1993 and 2004 and investigates whether marriage is associated with better psychological health in their older years. The findings suggest that previous health status had a significant effect on current mental health status. Taking marital quality into account, staying in very close relationship in marriage had a significant positive effect on mental well-being even after controlling for previous health status.

1	This article extends previous work on family structure and children's education by conceptualizing migration as a distinct form of family disruption that reduces parental input but brings substantial economic benefits through remittances. It examines the multiple and countervailing effects of migration on schooling in the context of substantial migration and limited educational opportunities for blacks in South Africa. The receipt of remittances substantially increases black children's school attendance, but has no such effect for whites. The effect for blacks is in part attributable to improved household economic conditions that increase household educational spending and reduce the demand for child labor. We also find a negative effect of parental absence due to migration, but it is largely cushioned by inflows of remittances. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score methods and contextual fixed-effect modeling suggest that the beneficial effect of remittances is relatively robust. We find further that remittances help ameliorate inter-familial socioeconomic inequality in schooling. Finally, we evaluate possible temporal changes and show that the positive and equalizing effects of remittances persisted during and after the apartheid regime. We conclude that labor migration and remittances, as institutionalized family strategies adopted by many blacks, help reconfigure structural opportunities in the educational stratification process in South Africa.
1	In this study, we construct a multivariate model that assesses the risk of an outbreak of civil war in a country over a period of 5 years into the future. In addition to structural factors of state weakness, which have dominated the literature on civil war onset, this model includes repression of basic human rights to personal integrity - an important harbinger of wars to come - as an aspect of state behavior. Our aim is not to explore the causal factors of civil war onset, but to build a model that includes indicators that correlate with civil war outbreak and may be used to predict it. Based on two versions of the model - logit and neural network - out-of-sample risk assessments for three different time periods are generated and compared to the historical record of civil war outbreak during those years. In addition, the model's ability to produce in-sample risk assessments over a 5-year period is tested. Finally, we compute truly predictive civil war risk assessments for all countries for which data are available, for the years 2008-2012. The analyses show that with a relatively simple model and based on publicly available data sources, meaningful civil war risk assessments can be computed. The quality of the predictions exceeds that of prominent studies, in which the risk of interstate war is assessed. 
1	"This article takes a new approach to gender and housework by identifying a new measure of gender deviance-work in gender-typical occupations-and by arguing that men who do ""women's work"" and women who do ""men's work"" in the labor market may seek to neutralize their gender deviance by doing male-and female-typed work at home. Analysis of data from the National Survey of Families and Households and the 2003-7 waves of the American Time Use Survey shows that men who do ""women's work"" in the market spend more time on male-typed housework relative to men in gender-balanced occupations and their wives spend more time on female-typed housework. Women in gender-atypical occupations also do more female-typed housework than women in gender-balanced occupations. The article provides clearer evidence about the important ways in which cultural conceptions of gender shape and are shaped by economic processes."
0	In poor- and middle-income countries, women’s tendency to justify wife beating has varied from less than 10% to more than 90%. Such wide variation in women’s justification of domestic violence against women suggests, on the one hand, that these views are not inevitable. Such wide variation, however, also raises concerns about the comparability of the questions used to elicit these data. This paper explores to what extent cross-national variation in women’s reported agreement that wife hitting or beating is justified can be explained by cross-national variation in survey design, socioeconomic conditions, or both. We base our analysis on 67 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), which were conducted between 1995 and 2007 and in which women 15 – 49 years answered attitudinal questions about domestic violence against women. The DHS, in general, are notable for their cross-national comparability, but variations in the wording of these attitudinal questions have occurred since their first administration in 1995. These 67 DHS, thus, provide an opportunity to quantify the sensitivity of women’s responses to such variations. Our findings provide insights about the cross-national comparability of such questions and the potential to improve them in the DHS and similar surveys.
0	Coming to define oneself as an adult is a critical transition.  Significant others and significant interactions with institutions are essential to the development of self.  Individuals whose childhood and adolescent experiences include contact with the public mental health or criminal justice system have numerous hurdles to overcome including disruptions in education and limited opportunities for pro-social interactions.  Their life experiences reflect deviant socialization processes in families and relationships.  This paper uses symbolic interactionism to highlight the emerging adult population with psychiatric disabilities involved with the criminal justice system.   Case studies and secondary data examine how emerging adults create meaning and define their situations based their progressive identity formation and social interactions.  Demographic, clinical, and criminal history variables analyzed describe this population as distinct.  Case studies suggest that their internalized informal social control mechanisms are poorly developed for independent community living due excess interactions with formal social control mechanisms.  Thus, emerging adults with psychiatric disabilities and criminal histories require external social controls to manage their interactions which ultimately influence their identity formation.
0	This study is designed to advance scholars understanding of the evolution of the financial media in the United States, as well as investigate a range of theoretical explanations for why firms structure themselves in particular ways in order to interact with the media. As such, this research attempts to answer the following question: Why do firms choose certain structures through which to interact with the financial news media?  Under shareholder capitalism, firms are driven by signals from financial markets and structure themselves in order to interact with the financial markets to maximize their shareholder value (see Davis 2005 for a comprehensive review and synthesis).  Given this focus on the financial markets, certain areas rise to importance in the firm, including the investor relations department (Rao and Sivakumar, 1999) and the chief financial officer position (Zorn, 2004).  Scholars have shown the critical nature of the interface between financial analysts and the financial markets by illuminating the legitimacy that firms receive from being followed by certain Wall Street analysts (Zuckerman, 1999).  The importance of firms presenting a coherent story that is easily understood by the market and analysts has also been demonstrated (Zuckerman, 2000).  The financial news media forms an additional signal of legitimacy for firms and is a mechanism for transmitting financial information to the market.  Thus, a deeper theoretical understanding of its role is needed.  This need is heightened by the wider availability of timely information and by the fact that news can be reflected in a firms stock price within seconds.
1	Although previous research demonstrates the importance of the availability of marriageable men, earnings, and employment stability for racial differences in marriage, it also suggests that other factors likely contribute to this variation. This study investigates a new factor that might help to explain racial variation in marriage, the kinship group. To explore this possible connection, we examine the influence of parental kin involvement experienced during childhood and adolescence on marriage in adulthood using all three waves of the National Survey of Families and Households. While few of the measures of kin ties have significant effects on marriage, some measures were significantly related and the patterns of associations sometimes varied by race. 
0	Neighborhood characteristics have been shown to be related to individual educational attainment. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and a family process model, we examine the role of neighborhood in influencing adolescents' overall expectations for their future accomplishments and subsequently examine how these expectations affect actual educational achievement in young adulthood.  We control for census level neighborhood characteristics and employ multilevel random effects models to capture unobserved neighborhood level heterogeneity in our analysis.  Moreover, we include mean individual expectations at the neighborhood level to capture normative neighborhood processes. Results show that neighborhood and school characteristics are important predictors of both expectations and future outcomes and even after these controls, intra-neighborhood variance accounts for roughly 13% of outcome variation (ICC=.13).  Additionally, normative expectations also influence individual level expectations and outcomes.  These results provide further compelling evidence regarding the role of place as being an important predictor of educational aspirations and achievement.
1	Although occupational segregation by sex has declined in recent decades with the rising numbers of women entering traditionally male occupations (e.g., law and medicine), the achievement of women within male-dominated occupations continues to lag behind that of their male colleagues. In this article, we draw on theories of proportional rarity, expectations states, and social support as three dimensions that provide a structural understanding of tokenism. We examine tokenism in the legal profession through: (1) organizational context in tern is of gender composition and gender ratios at upper echelons of the organizational hierarchy; (2) status characteristics of the minority and dominant groups; and (3) the content of communications (emotional and informational support) that women receive from their colleagues. These communications may act to integrate, or conversely, through their absence, exclude women and heighten boundaries to women's career advancement within the traditionally male profession of law. We used questionnaire data collected from a sample of 740 married lawyers working in law firms to examine these aspects of tokenism. The results reveal that women's rising representation in law firms leads to enhanced communication through informational and emotional support, benefiting both men and women lawyers. Yet, a more gender balanced organizational context, in terms of gender composition, does little to shift the expectation states associated with women lawyers and the professional disadvantage women face when they have family responsibilities.

The first tier of the study examined violent and nonviolent families, while the second tier examined batterers who abuse human family members only and those who also abuse the family pets.  Conditions within the violent homes with regard to the family pets were also examined. The present study (Tier 1) examined the attitudes, perceptions and behaviors of both violent and non-violent families with regard to companion animals.  The goal was to determine whether there existed significant differences between these two groups in their perceptions, attitudes and treatment of the family pets. Data was gathered through surveying victims of family violence residing at domestic violence shelters and a control group comprised of randomly selected pet guardians in upstate New York. More specifically, this study was conducted to determine whether there were differences between abusive and non-abusive family members in terms of (1) perceptions of companion animals as sentient beings vs. property, (2) tendencies to ""scapegoat"" the family pet for personal and/or family problems, (3) sensitivity to hassles and stressors in the environment--particularly those perceived as being caused by the pets, (4) unrealistic expectations about animals.  The results indicated there are statistically significant differences between these two groups in attitudes, beliefs and behaviors with regard to the family pet."
1	The authors explore the contributions of social and genetic influences to religious attitudes and practices in a population-based sample of 11-18 year olds and their mothers who responded to a Religious Attitudes and Practices Inventory and Religious Rearing Practices Inventory respectively. Contrary to genetic studies examining adult religious behavior, genetic influences were small, accounting for only 10 percent of the variance. Rather, the effects of the social environment were much larger, greater than 50 percent, and a majority of offspring similarity was explained by familial rearing. In light of the divergent finding between adolescents and adults, one supporting a socialization model and the other a genetic model, the importance of integrating genetic and social science methodology for complex social behaviors is discussed.
1	Model uncertainty is pervasive in quantitative research. Classical statistical theory assumes that only one (true) model is applied to a sample of data. In practice, however, researchers do not know which exact model specification is best. Modern computing power allows researchers to estimate a huge number of plausible models, yet only a few of these estimates are published. The result is a severe asymmetry of information between analyst and reader The applied modeling process produces a much wider range of estimates than is suggested by the usual standard errors or confidence intervals. I demonstrate this using the work of Barro and McCleary, on religion and economic growth. Small, sensible changes in their model specification produce large changes in the results: the results are inconsistent across time, and the instrumental variables strategy suffers from a weak instrument set. Also, the observed relationship between religiosity and economic growth does not hold in the West; it is largely a feature of Asian and African countries and of countries whose data is poor quality In short, empirical findings should be evaluated not just by their significance but also by their robustness to model specification. I conclude with suggestions for incorporating model uncertainty into practice and improving the transparency of social science research.
1	Using data from 6070 U.S. heterosexual internet dating profiles, this study examines how racial and gender exclusions are revealed in the preferences of black, Latino, Asian and white online daters. Consistent with social exchange and group positions theories, the study finds that whites are least open to out-dating and that, unlike blacks, Asians and Latinos have patterns of racial exclusion similar to those of whites. Like blacks, higher earning groups including Asian Indians, Middle Easterners and Asian men are highly excluded, suggesting that economic incorporation may not mirror acceptance in intimate settings. Finally, racial exclusion in dating is gendered; Asian males and black females are more highly excluded than their opposite-sex counterparts, suggesting that existing theories of race relations need to be expanded to account for gendered racial acceptance.
1	Using an event history framework we analyze the adoption rate of national human rights institutions. Neo-realist perspective predicts adoption rates to be positively influenced by favorable national profiles that lower the costs and make it more reasonable to establish these institutions. From a world polity perspective adoption rates will be positively influenced by a world saturated with human rights organizations and conferences, by increasing adoption densities, and by greater linkages to the world polity. We find support for both perspectives in the analysis of the human rights commission. Only the changing state of the world polity is consequential for the founding of the classical ombudsman office. We discuss the national incorporation of international human rights standards and its relevance to issues of state sovereignty and national citizenship.

However, even though the end goal is to manage service members evenly and efficiently, policies directing who is able to serve and in what capacity are largely shaped by social attitudes, particularly those surrounding gender and sexuality.  Building on this perspective, this paper analyzes how formal policy and informal norms, which privilege heteronormative masculinity, influence the gender and sexuality demographics of the American military.  We argue that even though formal policy change is on the horizon for both military women and gay men and lesbians that these formal changes may not have an immediate impact on who serves in the Armed Forces, the timing of their service, and where in the organization they do so.  Using a transnational perspective, we begin by discussing women’s military participation, both currently and over time, and the impact of enabling factors, such as changes in women’s labor force participation, legislative and judicial decree, and manpower needs during wartime.  We then discuss the evolution of formal policy regarding the service of openly gay men and lesbians and how their acknowledged presence impacts military culture.  After considering the integration experiences of openly gay men and lesbians in other Western countries, we discuss the history of their service in the American military and conclude with a discussion on the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
0	The prevalence of gender wage disadvantages in academic work is well-documented, but patterns of motherhood penalties or fatherhood premiums have been less explored among college and university faculty.  Where the influence of marriage or parenthood on faculty careers has been studied, the focus more typically has been on publication productivity than salary. In addition, women faculty in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields have also been the focus of numerous studies, since these fields are identified as critical areas for recruitment of women. In this study, we examine the effects of marital and parental status on the salaries of men and women faculty in STEM disciplines and academia generally. We find that marriage and children are linked to increased earnings among women outside of STEM and men both within and outside STEM, although patterns vary between groups and increases are more strongly linked to marriage than children. Salaries for women faculty in STEM, however, are not affected by marital or parental statuses, even when discipline, scholarly productivity, institution type, and professional age are taken into account. We explore these findings an
0	This paper analyzes the late twentieth century critique of regulation as a crisis of justification for the U.S. administrative state and argues that self-regulation, or the shifting of regulatory responsibilities from regulators to regulated entities, emerges as the solution.  I show how the capture theory, public choice and price-based critiques leveled at agencies eroded their legitimacy, demanding either new regulatory arrangements or new justifications for existing arrangements.  Using content analysis of a database of the nearly 1400 law review articles on command-and-control regulation, I trace how the legal critique of regulation interprets and responds to existing critiques and demonstrate how this discourse converges on self-regulation as both a reform program and a new justification for the regulatory state.
0	Research shows that rural students are at a disadvantage when it comes to the preparedness, attendance, and success in college. Research also shows that rural and urban students are most likely to drop out of high school compared to their suburban counter parts. When parent’s income and education are low so it the effectiveness of school programs. Resource disparities at both institutional levels explain the rural effect deficit in attainment and nearly the entire rural/nonrural gap in achievement (Roscigno&Crowlet, 2001). There are many factors that as to why rural students are less likely to attend college and have trouble in succeeding in college. In rural populations hyper-masculinity and gender expectations is a theme as to why males do not attend college at the same rates as females. Inversely, urban populations show that Black males that are high achievers seek out similar peers; this high attainment has shown to motivate those who were otherwise labeled as underachievers. This study employed quantitative and qualitative methodologies examining the impact high school setting has on college success. Specifically a survey was administered to 500 community college, college, and university students and a total of eight focus groups were conducted in four counties within Central Florida.
0	Globalization is highly situational depending on the external condition of capital flow and internal pressure of production and consumption in each region As China incorporated its economy into the global neo-liberal capitalist system, the hinterland region in Northwestern China was left behind as it could not adapt to the skill-based technological transformation in the global economy. This paper focuses on how the neo-liberalist turn in China has influenced patterns of migration in the context of disparate regional development, particularly in the Chinese Northwest region. Using GIS data and the Chinese Census, I explore the intersections of poverty, environment degradation, and ethnicities under the force of rapid economic restructuring and urbanization in Northwestern China. I discuss how the “Go West Strategies” have dealt with the combination of widespread land degradation, food insecurity, ethnic unrest and environmental migration. Given the geographical limits of Northwestern China, I argue that neo-liberalist market expansion is profoundly inadequate in Northwestern China because its limit in dealing with external cost associated with economic development.
0	Over the last several decades, the United States has become more unjust and more unequal, with wealth and income inequality reaching stratospheric levels.  Yet, it seems that much of the populace has grown more quiescent than ever.  This paper, as such, considers why the disenfranchised mobilize so rarely.  In the wake of the bourgeoning literature on the mass media and US political culture, it makes sense to refocus scholarly attention on the workplace.  I maintain that the workplace functions as the primary institution that legitimates and reproduces the extant socio-political order.  I organize the paper around three distinct but very interrelated problems.  The first involves how capital converts the purchase of labor power into useful labor, and how it induces consent among subordinate workers.  The second involves how capital organizes the labor process in ways that reproduce the social relations of capitalist production.  And the third, which attempts to conclude on an optimistic note, involves how workers disrupt the labor process in order to accommodate their own ends.
0	This paper is a largely anecdotal and autobiographical piece on the perceived loss of Native American identity in the Central Valley of California.  Due to the complex intersection of rural whiteness, symbolic ethnicity, and a large immigration of Latin American groups, some people have come to assume that all brown people in the Central Valley are Latina/o, a conclusion which few of such classified people choose to accept.  Such a loss is not only detrimental to the cultural heritage of future generations, but also contributes to the ignorant and mildly xenophobic mentality fueling such broad categorizations.
1	High cost barriers and immigration policy restrictions prevent many low-capital migrants from realizing their destination preferences. However, interviews with 95 Filipino domestic workers in the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore reveal how these low-capital migrants can intentionally follow a stepwise international migration trajectory, working their way up a hierarchy of destination countries and accumulating sufficient migrant capital in the process so as to eventually gain legal entry into their preferred destinations, often in the West. Such a trajectory differs from more frequently studied migration patterns in its number of stages, duration, intentionality, hierarchical progression, and dynamic nature.
0	Abstract: This paper examines how clergy in mainline Protestant congregations facilitate conversations about homosexuality among church members who have different positions on the issue. While national denominational meetings have clear procedures and rules for conversation and debate, local congregations do not. We examine how clergy create theses rules and spaces for conversation in local congregations by first situating the cause of public conflicts over homosexuality in an emotion, fear, rather than in the us versus them kind of culture wars framing evident in their denominations and American society more broadly. From this starting point, clergy do the cultural work, in several patterned ways, necessary to bring members of local congregations into sustained consideration of this and other controversial social issues. Rather than contributing to greater social polarization, this study points to the limits of the culture wars framework and to the ways mainline Protestant clergy and congregations provide members with caring civil repertoires for thinking and talking about homosexuality.
1	"This article presents findings from a content analysis of all 460 ""Dear Lawyer Bao"" (DLB) legal advice columns published in its ten-year history (1989-98) in the Beijing Evening News. While much sociolegal research has focused on the exercise of power in the legal process through the control of meaning in verbal, private face-to-face interactions, this article reveals similar meaning-making processes at play in publicly disseminated writing where the audience is far larger, the potential impact far wider, and the role of the state far greater. Lawyer Bao's popular image as valiant defender of ordinary people in trouble obscured and thus enhanced both the degree to which he was beholden to the state and the effectiveness with which he did the bidding of the state against the interests of the very letter-writers he purported to help. His ultimate allegiance to the state is reflected in two empirical patterns. First, the temporal distribution of problem topics featured in the DLB column corresponds less to shifts in public sentiment or objective popular needs and more to legislation, policy shifts, and political campaigns. Second, whether Lawyer Bao legitimized or delegitimized letter-writers' claims was determined primarily by the extent to which state interests were at stake in the problem at hand. Lawyer Bao tended to delegitimize labor grievances, housing demolition grievances, collective grievances of any kind, and other claims construed as potentially destabilizing or of challenge to state priorities."
0	Early findings from a ten-year panel study provide a baseline of two cohorts of adolescents in a rural community undergoing economic change. Findings illustrate the competing objectives confronting 7th and 11th grade students in rural New Hampshire and encapsulate what students may be going through in developing their plans for the future. Data indicate that student aspirations for economic and academic success are high, with most (90%) reporting they expect to graduate from college, a sizable minority (42%) reporting they will likely attend a graduate or professional program after college.  These results are illustrative of a noteworthy disconnect between Coos County youths future aspirations and the realities with which they may be confronted in their efforts to reach these goals.  According to 2000 Census data, Coos Countys educational attainment for the population 25 years and over was the lowest in the state of New Hampshire, with 11.9% holding a bachelors degree compared to the state average of 28.7%. Over time we will discover the extent to which students aspirations will be realized, or not and for those students who meet their goals against the odds, we will be able to ascertain the types of protective factors that may have helped them to be more resilient than others when confronted with the types of adversity these students have experienced in recent years. Ultimately, our objective is to learn something about the combination of factors that seem to predict more and less successful transitions into adulthood.
0	Research on female entrepreneurship tends to look at gender as a variable to the success or failure of womens businesses. While this is research is an important contribution to the understanding of female entrepreneurship, further research should examine how gender is experienced and manipulated in the environment of the business. Using the example of the scrapbooking industry, currently the most popular craft hobby in the United States, I argue how women use gendered practices to enhance their businesses. This is a form of business that I call gendered commerce. This research provides insight into how female owned businesses can succeed or fail based on gendered interactions.
1	Can economic ties positively influence social relations and actions? If so, how does this influence operate? Microfinance programs, which provide credit through a group-based lending strategy, provide the ideal setting for exploring these questions. This article examines whether structuring socially isolated women into peer-groups for an explicitly economic purpose, such as access to credit, has any effect on the women collective social behavior Based on interviews with 400 women from 59 microfinance groups in West Bengal, India, I find that one third of these groups undertook various collective actions. Improvements in women,v social capital and normative influence fostered this capacity for collective action. Several factors contributed to these transformations, including economic ties among members, the structure of the group network, and women participation in group meetings. Based on these findings, I argue that microfinance groups have the potential to promote women social capital and normative influence, thereby facilitating women collective empowerment. I conclude by discussing the need for refining our understanding of social capital and social ties that promote normative influence.
1	While income inequality among college graduates is well documented, inequality in occupational status remains largely unexplored. We examine whether and how occupational specificity of college majors is related to college graduates' transition into the labor market and their subsequent occupational trajectories. Analyses of NLSY79 indicate that occupationally specific degrees are beneficial at the point of entry into the labor market but have the lowest growth in occupational status over time. Students earning credentials focusing on general skills, in contrast, begin in jobs with low occupational status but subsequently report the greatest growth. These findings illuminate specific ways in which educational and occupational systems interact and provide a novel approach for understanding inequality in labor market outcomes among college graduates.
1	This article examines post-Civil Rights Act trends in private sector managerial representation for white men, white women, black men, and black women. We examine how three factors affect changing access to managerial positions: (1) industrial restructuring, (2) the process of bottom-up ascription, and (3) organizational characteristics. Accounting for compositional shifts in the labor supply, we find that white male managerial overrepresentation remains virtually unchanged since 1966, even while other status groups make gains. A significant portion of the observed equal opportunity advance for women and blacks takes place in the expanding service sectors of the economy. We also find that female and minority gains are enhanced in larger and more managerially intensive workplaces. For all groups, managerial representation is increasingly tied to the presence of similar others in nonmanagerial jobs. Further examination reveals a new status hierarchy of managers and subordinates-a hierarchy wherein white men are likely to manage men of all races. White women, in comparison, are realizing a growing racial privilege in managing women of color.
0	Although Knowledge has grown to occupy a major role in the discussion on firm performance, we currently know little about the micro-processes involved in search and transfer of knowledge. Social network theory, useful elsewhere, is mostly silent about network dynamics. Drawing on extensive fieldwork in multiple offices of a large, multinational professional service firm, we describe how employees actively search among unacquainted others and draw needed resources, bypassing direct and indirect network ties altogether. We present the minutiae of such transactions, and hypothesize on two circumstantial conditions to for their success: affiliation and status similarity. Highlighting the difference between the observed phenomenon, indirect ties, and complete unacquaintanceship, we present a definition of performative ties. We argue that such ties are theoretically significant, have several advantages for knowledge dissemination, and have been observed elsewhere, although never explicitly identified. We compare performative ties to market, embedded, and community based exchange relations, to argue that such ties allow wide search for potential exchange partners, and intimate transfer once they are found. Thus performative ties combine benefits previously attributed to one mode of exchange or another.
0	This paper examines the relationship between legal and scientific fields. Recently, sociologists of law moved from viewing law as exogenous constraint on behavior of regulated social actors to viewing law as emerging endogenously from the social fields it regulates. Meanwhile, sociologists and historians of scienc debated the relative merits of internalist vs. externalist perspectives on scientific evolution.   Central to externalist accounts of scientific development is the state – a key law producing institution. This paper proposes a theoretical perspective emphasizing co-production of legal and scientific knowledge and institutions.  It grounds the perspective empirically in analysis of the reciprocal relationship between enforcement of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the science of industrial psychology.  New legislative enactments provide opportunities for scientific knowledge to penetrate the legal system and become translated into legal terms.  When scientific knowledge becomes incorporated into interpretation and enforcement of legislative law as social authority – ie, the rationale for judicial rule-making—then law’s own institutional logic of relying on precedent and reasoning by analogy ensures that science and scientists will have ongoing influence on legal development.    At the same time, by helping set the agenda for scientific research and providing new professional opportunities for researchers, institutionalized legal doctrine is likely to have implications for the content of scientific knowledge.   But because of differences in institutional logic, wherein legal cumulation is backward looking whereas scientific cumulation is forward looking, the co-production of law and science may produce serious mismatch between legal doctrine and scientific knowledge.
1	This article argues that existing studies on cultural capital and educational success fail to distinguish the different channels through which cultural capital promotes educational success. Following Bourdieu, the article proposes that for cultural capital to promote educational success three conditions must hold: (1. parents must possess cultural capital, (2. they must transfer their cultural capital to children, and (3. children must absorb cultural capital and convert it into educational success. This research develops an empirical model that analyzes the significance of the three effects with respect to Danish children choice of secondary education. Denmark is well-suited for this study because access to secondary education is particularly meritocratic. The empirical analysis shows that all three channels through which cultural capital affects educational success are important.
0	Identifying early risk factors for later deviant behavior has been a core aim in research in criminology and deviance. One body of literature has shown that early deviance and criminal activity predicts later criminal activity. A second set of research has shown that self-derogation/rejection is strongly related to social deviance. Finally, there is a large literature showing that substance abuse and dependence are often precursors to life-course persistent deviance. This paper examines how linkages between early self-derogation and deviance in and reported deviance in young adulthood are mediated and/or moderated by substance use problems. Data from three waves of a ten-year prospective study were employed to examine these relationships among a multiethnic sample of young adult males (N = 659). Analysis confirmed that self-derogation and early deviance (age 11) were independently related to criminal behaviors in young adulthood (age 22). However, controlling for substance use problems at age 20 reduced the magnitude of the relationship between early deviance and later deviance to non-significance, but the association between self-derogation and later deviance was unchanged. These findings underscore the utility of these factors in identifying high risk individuals for prevention and early intervention efforts.
1	The expansion of women's political representation ranks among the most significant trends in American politics of the last 100 years. In this paper, we develop two longitudinal theories to explain patterns of growth and change in women's state legislative representation over time. Gender salience suggests that years in which women's absence from politics is problematized (e.g., 1992-the Year of the Woman) will demonstrate higher levels of growth. Political climate suggests that periods in which domestic issues are stressed (e.g., the 1990s) will produce higher levels of growth than periods in which international issues are stressed (e.g., post 9/11). Combinations of these two theories create four possible trajectories of growth in women's representation that may be observed over time. We use latent growth curve models to assess the four theoretical trajectories, using data on women's state legislative representation from 1982 to 2006. We find that while women achieved fleeting success in the Year of the Woman, further gains were limited in the remainder of the 1990s and average growth stalled completely after 2001. Our results show futher that gender salience and, to a lesser extent political, climate matter to growth and change in women's political power over time. 
1	"This article examines between-group differences in support for military action in the period since the Vietnam War. During the Vietnam War, support for military action was stronger among men, whites, the more educated, the more affluent, and younger persons. In the post-Vietnam era, men have remained consistently more supportive of military action, despite recent changes in gender roles and gender politics. Racial differences have remained strong, but not uniformly so. The gap between whites and nonwhites has been most pronounced in periods of intense partisanship or when military events have sparked a ""rally-'round-the-flag"" response that affected whites more than nonwhites. Education and income differences have generally followed a similar pattern, although there are signs of a weakening (or even reversal) of differences in attitudes to war on the education variable. Another change in the post-Vietnam era has been the relative decline in support for military action among younger persons. These data are used to explore the diverse causes and meanings of attitudes toward the use of military force and to assess the implications of the social distribution of pro-and antiwar opinion for the conduct of U. S foreign policy and political mobilization on issues of war and peace. Keywords: militarism, public opinion, foreign policy, Vietnam War, Iraq War."
1	Two long-standing research problems of interest to sociologists are sources of variations in social inequalities and differential contributions of the temporal dimensions of age, time period, and cohort to variations in social phenomena. Recently, scholars have introduced a model called Variance Function Regression for the study of the former problem, and a model called Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort regression has been developed for the study of the latter. This article presents an integration of these two models as a means to study the evolution of social inequalities along distinct temporal dimensions. We apply the integrated model to survey data on subjective health status. We find substantial age, period, and cohort effects, as well as gender differences, not only for the conditional mean of self-rated health (i.e., between-group disparities), but also for the variance in this mean (i.e., within-group disparities)-and it is detection of age, period, and cohort variations in the latter disparities that application of the integrated model permits. Net of effects of age and individual-level covariates, in recent decades, cohort differences in conditional means of self-rated health have been less important than period differences that cut across all cohorts. By contrast, cohort differences of variances in these conditional means have dominated period differences. In particular, post-baby boom birth cohorts show significant and increasing levels of within-group disparities. These findings illustrate how the integrated model provides a powerful framework through which to identify and study the evolution of variations in social inequalities across age, period, and cohort temporal dimensions. Accordingly, this model should be broadly applicable to the study of social inequality in many different substantive contexts.
1	This article employs a unique method of inferring the legal status of Mexican immigrants in the Survey of Income and Program Participation to offer new evidence of the role of legal authorization in the United States on workers' wages. We estimate wage trajectories for four groups: documented Mexican immigrants, undocumented Mexican immigrants, U.S-born Mexican Americans and native non-Latino whites. Our estimates reveal a gross 17 percent wage disparity between documented and undocumented Mexican immigrant men, and a 9 percent documented-undocumented wage disparity for Mexican immigrant women. When worker human capital and occupation are held constant, these wage gaps reduce to 8 and 4 percent, respectively. We also find large differences in returns to human capital with undocumented Mexican immigrants having the lowest wage returns to human capital and having very slow wage growth over time.
0	The prospects for Brazil rising from the semi-periphery are bleak. This is due to both world systems considerations based on international indebtedness, penetration of foriegn capital and fiscal crisis within the state - and agency considerations based on political and social factors within Brazil itself. The key to rising into the core is developing local proprietary technology which could created pro-Brazilian favorable terms of trade. Debt induced high interest rates are limiting economic growth and investment reducing local capital's ability to generate such technology. Increased foriegn ownership of Brazilian companies is leading to a reduction of research and development actitivies. An alternative road to a locally controlled science would be development of basic science at the university level. Brazilian universities are hampered by low salaries, poor facilities, very low graduation rates, and unwieldy administrative structures that prevent universities from rewarding star researchers. These factors stem less from debt-induced fiscal crisis within the state and more of political considerations within Brazil that lead to the misallocation of scarce educational resources. Agency attempts to overcome these handicaps are having mixed results. The new anti-globalization social movements coming out of Porto Alegre are having impressive results in improving municipal governance - but face too many political obstacles to have a chance to produce a national Brazilian state willing to confront international capital. There are however positive developments in less glamorous areas. The economic wing of the Porto Alegre movement - the Economia Solidaria - is producing impressive increases in employment and reductions in poverty in Brazil - using an explicit nationalist anti-globalization strategy. Furthermore, routine social and economic policies such as support for small business are confronting for the first time disarticulation in Brazil and producing a more balanced distribution of economic incentives and government benefits. These developments by themselves will not propel Brazil into the core. However there is one conjunctural factor that could make a difference .....
1	The U S residential landscape is increasingly multi-racial and multi-ethnic giving rise to the question of how to compare dichotomous segregation among multiple groups living in the same area To address the problem in the existing dichotomous approach, which offers no common basis for comparing dichotomous segregation among multiple groups this paper develops a weighted segregation ratio approach based on Theil s segregation index and its additive decomposability This approach can be used to bridge information obtained from dichotomous segregation between specific groups (such as black-white and black-Hispanic), and dichotomous segregation between group and non-group (such as white-non-white and black-non-black) in previous studies We apply both dichotomous and weighted segregation ratio approaches to 1990 and 2000 US census data Results are interpreted for five selected metropolitan areas as well as for the weighted national average This new approach yields distinctive findings that portray the complicated process of residential segregation including the increasing significance of Hispanic segregation and Asian segregation in the decade from 1990 to 2000 
0	The question of why students think that there are two kinds of American history taughtone in the K-12 system, and one in the university systemcan be thought about critically using Emile Durkheims description of the sacred and the profane.  The type of history taught in K-12 often focuses on the idealized accounts of the past which protect the status quo.  K-12 history emphasizes the underlying values which Durkheim calls the sacred, and which are reproduced through the development of a triumphal history.  The sacred values K-12 History emphasize selfless acts of people who sacrificed on behalf of the larger society.  On the other hand, the curriculum emphasized in college courses often focuses on the everyday temptations which are not in the interests of the larger society, and which Durkheim calls profane.  The dissonance between these two types of historythe sacred and profaneis important for understanding not only why there are different types of history taught, but also why social change can be so difficult.
1	"Retrospective questions on educational attainment in national surveys and censuses tend to over-estimate high school graduation rates by 15-20% points relative to administrative records. Administrative data on educational enrollment are, however, only available at the aggregate level (state, school district, and school levels) and the recording of inter-school transfers are generally incomplete. With access to linked individual-level administrative records from a very large ""West Coast metropolitan school district"" we track patterns of high school attrition and on-time high school graduation of individual students. Even with adjustments for the omission of out-of-district transfers (estimates of omission are presented), the results of this study show that failure in high school, as indexed by retention and attrition, are almost as common as on-time high school graduation. In addition to the usual risk factors of disadvantaged background, we find that the ""9th grade shock""-an unpredicted decline in academic performance upon entering high school-is a key mechanism behind the continuing crisis of high school attrition.

0	In 2003, Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger successfully won his bid to become governor of California in a special election.  The election and its candidates were criticized as a media circus and bemoaned as evidence of a general decay of American democracy.  Using the pioneering work of Clifford Geertz, we offer an alternative account that normalizes the putative oddities of the California political system and the narrative of demise it evokes.  This paper applies the politics-as-theatre perspective to the gubernatorial campaigns of Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, which serve as illustrative cases of the much-maligned celebrity politics.  We suggest that the performance of these two candidates mirrors the broader relationship between politics and cultural myths.
1	The growth of precarious work since the 1970s has emerged as a core contemporary concern within politics, in the media, and among researchers. Uncertain and unpredictable work contrasts with the relative security, that characterized the three decades following World War II. Precarious work Constitutes a global challenge that has a wide range of consequences cutting across many, areas of concern to sociologists. Hence, it is increasingly important to understand the new workplace arrangements that generate precarious work and worker insecurity. A focus on employment relations forms the foundation of theories of the institutions and structures that generate Precarious work and the cultural and individual factors that influence people's responses to uncertainty. Sociologists are well-positioned to explain, offer insight, and provide input into public policy, about such changes and the state of contemporary employment relations.
1	In the United States, racial disparities in incarceration and their consequences are widely discussed and debated. Previous research suggests that perceptions of crime and the operations of the criminal justice system play an important role in shaping how Americans think about race. This study extends the conversation by exploring whether being incarcerated affects how individuals perceive their own race as well as how they are perceived by others, using unique longitudinal data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Results show that respondents who have been incarcerated are more likely to identify and be seen as black, and less likely to identify and be seen as white, regardless of how they were perceived or identified previously. This suggests that race is not a fixed characteristic of individuals but is flexible and continually negotiated in everyday interactions.
0	Organizations recurrently need to allocate scare resources to competing organizational units and projects. At a newspaper, a particularly scarce resource is front page space, the allocation of which has to be redecided on a daily basis, on the basis of claims engendered by events in the external world. Here I analyze competition for front page space among the four main desks (foreign, national, business and metro) of the New York Times for the period 1980-2004. By modeling the number of front page articles originating from each desk as a function of the number of articles each desk contributes to the paper as a whole, I infer relations of precedence, whereby one desk advances onto the front page at the direct expense of another desk. On this basis, I reconstruct the sociometric structure governing allocation decisions, one combining limited transitivity, sustained competition, and benign co-existence. Inertial (autoregressive) tendencies are also uncovered. Finally, I find evidence that the front page is not an entirely fixed resource, but one that expands or contracts in effective size depending on the amount of input from the foreign, business, and metro desks.
1	This research examines the relationship between work disability and food insecurity, and tests whether the positive association between disability and food insecurity is accounted for by two mechanisms: economic resources and/or competing consumption needs. A sample (N = 6997) is chosen from the 1999 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with over 1200 households headed by people with disabilities. Findings support both mechanisms but depending on the levels of food insecurity and the types of family economic resources, their success at explaining the relationship of disability with food insecurity varies. In addition, we find that household assets are more effective than income in protecting people with disabilities against food insecurity. Implications for disability policy and food assistance programs are discussed. 
1	"This article builds on earlier studies that have examined ""the economic cost of homosexuality,"" by using data from the 2000 U.S. Census and by employing multilevel analyses. Our findings indicate that partnered gay men experience a 12.5 percent earnings penalty compared to married heterosexual men, and a statistically insignificant earnings penalty compared to partnered heterosexual men, when both individual- and state-level characteristics are taken into account. Partnered lesbians experience about a 3.5 percent earnings advantage compared to married heterosexual women, and a 9 percent earnings advantage compared to partnered heterosexual women. Although individual-level characteristics are the primary determinants of their earnings, we find that some contextual characteristics affect the earnings of partnered gay men and lesbians, relative to partnered heterosexuals, and that these effects vary by sex."
0	This paper examines the particular biographical career trajectories of a particular kind of worker who struggles in, and profits off of, public spaces: walking tour guides. This group of individuals participates in and around the tourism industry deriving a certain amount of significance to their lives while they, with reciprocity, provide meaning to those spaces and places. Being a full time walking guide is difficult, but many do not want to work full time, finding it to be a job to pass through to another career, or as a great side project to their other endeavors. This paper offers a few examples of how guides, often serendipitously, came into the business, the costs and benefits of those career choices, and concludes with a discussion of how they find guiding as a significant and meaningful career.
0	This paper examines the mode of immigrant incorporation in Japan, focusing on discursive opportunity structures.  In immigration literature, the Japanese case is often categorized as an exclusive model based on an ethnonational conception of nationhood.  Such portrayal however fails to capture the political dynamics of immigrant incorporation.  Indeed, recent policy discussion in Japan is characterized less by exclusion than by inclusion.  What is notable, though, is that immigrants are expected to be incorporated into the host society as foreigners rather than as ‘Japanese’ citizens with full citizenship rights.  Activists working on behalf of immigrants have adopted ‘foreigner (gaikokujin)’ as a primary collective identity and chosen to seek the “denizenship model” rather than the “naturalization model.”  The purpose of this paper is to understand this prevailing mode of immigrant incorporation in Japan.  It focuses on how activists have framed their demand, while reacting to the Japanese government policy, drawing on the ideational trend in globalization, and defining common interests between old-timer and newcomer immigrants.  The analysis in this paper will demonstrate how the underlying opportunity structures have been reproduced in each phase of immigration and integration in Japan, making the ‘foreigner’ category both legitimate and effective in claims-making activities.
1	We suggest that moral panics exert spillover effects through stigma by mere association. Individuals are harmed even if their ties to stigmatized affiliates are heterophilous, and high-status individuals can also suffer. This creates a broadcast effect that increases the scale of the moral panic. Analyzing the U.S. film industry from 1945 to 1960, we examine how artists' employment in feature films was influenced by their associations with co-workers who were blacklisted as communists after working with the focal artist. Mere association reduces an artist's chances of working again, and one exposure is enough to impair work prospects. Furthermore, actors' careers are impaired when writers with whom they worked are blacklisted. Moreover, the negative effects of stigma by mere association hold even when the focal artist has received public acclaim. These findings have broad implications. When a few individuals or organizations are engaged in wrongdoing and publicly targeted, stigma by association can lead to false positives and harm many innocents.
1	"Drawing on an ethnography of queer women in Ithaca, New York, this article documents the perceived costs and benefits for a minority group's ties of changing attitudes, identities, and legislation. It reveals that despite the high proportion of queer women in Ithaca most informants report disappointment with ""community."" However, this disappointment does not correlate with a dearth of affective local ties; queer women detail a wealth of supportive ties to heterosexual and queer neighbors. Informants' simultaneous disappointment with ""community"" and rich local ties emerge from: (1) a shift from identity politics and networks to emphasis on shared cultural, social, and political tastes and activities; (2) the breadth of the queer female population; and (3) queer women's successful integration into Ithaca's social, cultural, and political spheres. From informants' perspectives these conditions weaken ""real"" community, which they associate with homogenous place-based networks of marginalized individuals, and promote a strong sense of ambient community: feelings of belonging and connection that arise from informal, voluntary, and affective ties largely fashioned around shared tastes and activities and predicated on a sense of safety and acceptance forged among heterogeneous proximate individuals. Contra the prevailing expectation that place-based ties best flourish among marginalized individuals who share a dominant identity and formal institutions, the article demonstrates that when social and cultural conditions change local ties change, too they do not simply disappear. Social and cultural shifts alter the foundation of local ties and informants' assessment thereof"
0	This study involves an investigation into the effectiveness of Catholic and public elementary schools in bringing about Mathematics and Reading achievement over six years of schooling. This is accomplished by modeling achievement growth from the beginning of Kindergarten to the fifth grade using ECLS-K data. This study finds that students who are in public schools during the entire time period of the study make larger gains in Mathematics achievement then do those in Catholic schools. Students who switch from a Catholic to public school during the time period of the study also see similar increases in their rate of Mathematics achievement growth. There are not substantial differences between Catholic and public school students in their rate of Reading achievement growth. Finally, this study finds that opportunities to learn differ consistently between sectors over the time period of this study. Most notably Catholic schools spend significantly less time on Mathematics and Language Arts instruction then do public schools. However, the opportunities to learn factors used in this study do not fully mediate the lower achievement growth of Catholic school students in Mathematics.
0	The central role of the state and state elites in constructing nations and national identity has been established.  At the same time, the U.S. is often overlooked as a site of nation-building and enactment of national identity more generally. To uncover how varying conceptions of citizenship informed federal debate and legislation about national identity, I analyze discourse surrounding immigration legislation in two federal Congressional debates between 1880-1924, a key period of changes in immigration and consolidation of federal regulatory power in the U.S.  Analysis shows the interwoven nature of the legal regulation of character and legal regulation of national belonging, suggesting overlapping rather than distinct models of legal and cultural citizenship. Legal proscriptions of citizenship reveal assumptions about national belonging that challenge dominant conceptions of universal citizenship and its practice in democratic nations.
1	"Increasing constraints placed on race-based school diversification have shifted attention to socioeconomic desegregation. Although past research suggests that socioeconomic desegregation can produce heightened achievement, the ""frog pond"" perspective points to potential problems with socioeconomic desegregation in nonachievement domains. Such problems are important in their own right, and they may also chip away at the magnitude of potential achievement benefits. In this article, I report conducted propensity score analyses and robustness calculations on a sample of public high schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. As the proportion of the student body with middle- or high-income parents increased, low-income students progressed less far in math and science. Moreover, as the proportion of the student body with middle- or high-income or college-educated parents increased, low-income students experienced more psychosocial problems. Such patterns were often more pronounced among African American and Latina students. These findings suggest curricular and social psychological mechanisms of oft-noted frog pond effects in schools and extend the frog pond framework beyond achievement itself to demographic statuses (e.g., race/ethniciry and SES) perceptually linked to achievement. In terms of policy, these findings indicate that socioeconomic desegregation plans should also attend to equity in course enrollments and the social integration of students more generally."
1	This study revisits the Wisconsin model of status attainment from a life course developmental perspective Fixed-effects regression analyses lend strong support to the Wisconsin framework's core proposition that academic performance and significant others' influence shape educational expectations. However, investigating the process of expectation formation back to the elementary grades yields insights not evident when analyses are limited to the high school years: (1. many youth consistently expect to attend college from as early as fourth grade; (2. the expectations of middle- and low-SES youth are less stable, and across years the preponderance of their exposure to socialization influences mitigates against sustained college ambitions; (3. long-term stable expectations are more efficacious in forecasting college enrollment than are changing, volatile expectations As anticipated in the Wisconsin framework, family- and school-based socialization processes indeed contribute to social reproduction through children's educational expectations, but the process starts much earlier and includes dynamics outside the scope of the original status attainment studies.
1	From 2000 through 2008, initiatives proposing to ban same-sex marriage were on the ballot in 28 states. Although same-sex marriage opponents scored lopsided victories in most cases, voting outcomes varied substantially at the county level. This article examines sources of that variation and argues that opposition to same-sex marriage should be strong in communities characterized by the predominance of traditional gender roles and family structure. Perhaps more interestingly the analysis also shows that the effects of traditional family structure and gender roles are especially strong in counties characterized by weak community cohesion, as indicated by residential instability, low rates of home ownership, and high crime rates.
0	This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between race and neighborhood outcomes and asks whether members of different racial groups have differential access to quality neighborhoods. It goes beyond existing studies by expanding the conventional definition of locational attainment to include other neighborhood characteristics using data from the national sample of the American Housing Survey of 1993 and a cluster of nearest neighbors as a proxy for neighborhood. Racial group membership was found to have an effect over and above socioeconomic and life cycle characteristics in predicting the quality of neighborhoods in which householders reside, especially for Blacks. With respect to housing, all non-White groups in the study were found to live in neighborhoods with significantly poorer housing quality than Whites even after controlling for socioeconomic status. The results provide selective support for place stratification theory and spatial assimilation theory depending on the neighborhood dimension  and racial group.
0	Adopting a model of structured mobilization, this paper argues that Canadian and American variants of multiculturalism have divergent effects on immigrants political incorporation.  Although Canadians like to contrast their multicultural mosaic with the perceived American melting pot, both countries embrace a form of multiculturalism that celebrates diversity.  There are, however, two important differences that affect political integration.  First, Americans support for cultural diversity is social rather than political.  There is no official policy of cultural diversity in the United States whereas in Canada the state has officially endorsed multiculturalism, both symbolically and through funding or other material support.  I find that government intervention engenders a greater sense of political standing and obligation to participate among Portuguese and Vietnamese immigrants in Toronto than in Boston, and this holds true for both ordinary community members and community leaders.  Second, political multiculturalism in the United States is race-based while in Canada it is largely centered on ethnicity, usually defined by country of origin.  Canadian multiculturalism makes it somewhat harder to address racial barriers to integration, but it appears to provide a more inclusive starting point for inter-group dialogue than in the United States.  I make this argument based on documentary evidence and 147 qualitative interviews with members of the Vietnamese and Portuguese communities of Boston, MA and Toronto, ON.  Focusing on the symbolic and material resources provided by government helps explain why, since 1970, Canada has been more successful in the political incorporation of newcomers than the United States.
0	Empirical studies demonstrate that implementations of enterprise resource planning technologies (ERP) often fail, at least in part because of user resistance or other non-technological issues.  Because of the interdependent nature and scope of ERP technology, deterministic conceptualizations of technology acceptance are insufficient to explain this failure phenomenon since such models dont adequately consider the influence of non-technological factors on the acceptance or resistance of ERP technologies.  I provide a multi-level model that considers ERP-specific technological factors within a contextual framework that includes potential individual, group, or organizational effects on technology acceptance or resistance.
1	How has growing knowledge about human genetics affected how American textbooks present race? This article analyzes 80 biology textbooks published from 1952 to 2002 to reveal that U. S. biology texts have pursued the topic of race with renewed vigor in recent years. Moreover, textbooks have redefined race as genetic without furnishing empirical evidence for this framing. The textbooks' transformation sheds light on the broader relationship between race and science in the United States, where claims about racial difference have not only drawn instrumentally and selectively from empirical research, but at times forgo scientific grounding altogether. As the textbooks show, both the tight and the loose linkage of race to science can preserve the cultural authority of the race concept. The texts also make clear that race is not a one-time construct or a relic of centuries past. Instead, it is continually remade-and is being reworked today-suggesting its dynamic adaptation for ongoing use as a fundamental tool of social stratification.
0	This paper explores the implications of a basic, theoretical model of interaction between two actors over time.  It identifies the types of two actor systems that are likely to approach a stable equilibrium, become unstable, or exhibit oscillatory (stable or unstable) behavior.  In particular, this research explores a number of variations of a differential equation model for couples (Felmlee and Greenberg, 1999).  Several basic assumptions about dyads are formalized in a series of models, and illustrations of each model are discussed.  The models demonstrate that if both actors are independent of each other, dependent on each other, or cooperative,  then a stable equilibrium is approached over time.  Stability is not obtained, on the other hand, when both actors are independent reactionaries or system contrarians.  In several other combinations of types of actors, the outcome depends on the values of the parameters, that is, the relative strength of various model components.  For example, when a dependent actor is paired with a relatively highly uncooperative partner, then a stable cyclical interaction pattern develops; in other specifications of the model, the system converges to a point equilibrium, or produces exploding oscillations.  Negative, reactionary, or contrary behavior on the part of at least one actor is necessary, but not sufficient, for instability.  The findings illustrate the complexity of a simple two-actor dynamic system.  They also demonstrate that ignoring the endogenous system created by a pair of interdependent actors is misleading when considering the long-term behavior of a pair.
0	Using hierarchical data from a 2001 survey of rural villages and households in a Chinese province, this study examines changes brought to income determination by market-oriented economic transition. The inconclusiveness of previous debates is largely attributable to the difficulty in dealing with complex interactions between market and redistributive mechanisms. This study adopts a new conceptual model of embedded markets that makes the distinction between two types of interactions, each identifying a distinctive empirical task. First, interactions exist between coexisting market and redistributive mechanisms of economic integration. Second, in the making of market institutions, state actors assert their political logic and constitute and regulate the market in specific ways. To empirically evaluate effects of market transition, we need to first disentangle the effect of market processes from that of redistributive ones, and second, locate the source of the distinctive effect of market processes in the market institutions in which they are embedded. This model guides the empirical analysis of one specifically instituted market process in rural Chinaexchange of agricultural land among peasant households. The emerging land market has turned the previously more equally allocated land into a new source of income inequality and tends to further differentiate rural households. Two key market institutions are found to be primarily responsible for the specific qualities this market process displays: the property-rights institution that rests the ownership of rural land in village communities and the rules of exchange that protect rural land markets from urban forces and segregate them locally with village boundaries. Effects of this market process on income are highly sensitive to changes in the economic context and institutional setting, further indicating that market processes have variable consequences depending on the specific institutions in which they are embedded.
1	The dramatic increase in Hispanic immigration to the United States in recent decades has been coterminous with fundamental shifts in the labor market towards heightened flexibility, instability, and informality. As a result, the low-wage labor market is increasingly occupied by Hispanic immigrants, many of whom are undocumented. While numerous studies examine the implications for natives' employment prospects, our understanding of low-wage immigrants themselves remains underdeveloped. Drawing on original data collected in Durham, North Carolina, this article provides a more holistic account of immigrant Hispanic's labor market experiences, examining not only wages but also employment instability and benefit coverage. The analysis evaluates the role of human capital and immigration characteristics, including legal status, in shaping compensation outcomes, as well as the influence of other employment characteristics. Findings highlight the salience of nonstandard work arrangements such as subcontracting and informal employment to the labor market experiences of immigrant Hispanic men, and describe the constellation of risk factors that powerfully bound immigrant employment outcomes.
0	This paper uses a comparison of four disparate collective actions to address the role of art in contemporary resistance. Using participant observation, photographic records, and an exhaustive content analysis of protest speeches, leaflets, and artworks, I develop a typology of the roles of art in protests. Art can be: (a) purely instrumental (art for politics); (b) expressive and symbolic (art for arts sake); or (c) expressive and instrumental (art for individual and social liberation). Art playing this third role seeks social change through intimate liberationsself-empowerment at an individual level.  These three roles of art reflect the multi-faceted character of protests more broadly. They too can be (a) instrumental, with political ends (especially from the point of view of protest leaders); (b) expressive, with symbolic ends (especially for socially isolated or marginalized groups); or (c) aimed at intimate changes independent of socio-political changes (especially for distinct groups of artist-activists). This view of resistance stands in contrast to the mainstream literatures presentation of social movements as only (strategic-instrumental) politics by other means.
0	The paper examines the surge of Chinese nationalist movements in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia in the decades prior to and during the China-Japan War of 1931 to 1945. It extends and sharpens Benedict Andersons concepts of imagined communities and long-distance nationalism. Anderson argues that diaporas of the same ethnic root would identify with each other. Using a wide range of archival and documentary sources (including British colonial archives, Japanese intelligence reports, Chinese newspapers, commercial directories, and newsletters of business and native-place associations), my research however shows the tenacious growth of Chinese sub-ethnic cleavages in diasporic nationalist movements. I argue that diasporic Chinese bourgeois initiatives to organize nationalist movements invariably drew on sub-ethnic ties to mobilize support. Although these movements solicited support from the bourgeoisie through their transnational business networks, the movements were by and large operated by each major sub-ethnic group. In short, Chinese diasporic nationalism lacked the capacity to unite all sub-ethnic groups. Instead it provided the terrain for competition among sub-ethnic business networks and the political parties they supported.
0	This paper explores the mechanism that creates career images of Japanese workers. The deterioration in the Japanese employment practice has made Japanese workers think about their future career including the possibility of switching companies. With this change in the Japanese labor market as the theoretical background, I study the mechanism focusing on how workers career images deviate from the long-term employment practice, a main component of the Japanese employment practice, and why. The results of an analysis of a data set collected in Japan in 2003 show that three factors affect career images. The first factor is respondents recognition of their career, which has strong psychological inertia. The second factor is their positions in the labor market such as gender, employment status, and firm size. The third factor is their educational level, which is an important aspect of their human capital. In addition to these results, comparison between working under the long-term employment practice and becoming independent points out that the second and the third factors affect the creation of career images after controlling the effect of the first factor, even though the first factor has a very strong effect on career images.
0	In April 2004 a new pay for performance contract was introduced for general practice (family medicine) in the UK. The contract can be interpreted as part of the process of promoting enterprise in public services. This paper examines the impact of this change on practice organisation and professional identity. Based on an ethnographic case study, we found that doctors engaged in a no change narrative, suggesting that the new contract had made little impact on their work. This allowed them to maintain their claims to provide patient-centred care, whilst supporting the use of pay-for-performance targets, which threaten to override patients agendas and concerns. Our data suggest that despite traditional professional identity narratives which emphasise holism or biopsychosocial approaches in primary care, there has been a shift towards the delivery of biomedical care by nurses and doctors. At the same time, both groups are becoming enrolled, to varying degrees, in regimes of self-surveillance. Furthermore, far from eradicating or reducing bureaucracy as proponents suggest, the expansion of enterprise in our case study site was facilitated by the creation of new forms of bureaucracy and top-down surveillance.
1	The expansion of the U. S. penal system has important consequences for poverty and inequality, yet little is known about the imposition of monetary sanctions. This study analyzes national and state-level court data to assess their imposition and interview data to identify their social and legal consequences. Findings indicate that monetary sanctions are imposed on a substantial majority of the millions of people convicted of crimes in the United States annually and that legal debt is substantial relative to expected earnings. This indebtedness reproduces disadvantage by reducing family income, by limiting access to opportunities and resources, and by increasing the likelihood of ongoing criminal justice involvement.

1	One shortcoming in the literature on policy framing has been the absence of analytic models through which to explicate change. This paper advances research in this area in three related ways. First, it links policy frames to the actors who employ them. Second, based upon this linkage it proposes two complementary approaches for examining longitudinal change in policy framing. an actor representation approach and a frame adoption approach. Third, it assesses the relative contribution Of each process using demographic decomposition analysis. This analytic framework is illustrated using the case of debates over welfare reform in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. The findings are consistent with expectations from the frame adoption approach, suggesting that ideational diffusion was largely responsible for changing discourse during this period.
0	This study explores how the father-child relationship and fathers parenting styles are associated with adolescents risk  of first delinquency and substance use.  Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997, Rounds 1  3 (n =5,345) among adolescents in intact families, and discrete time logistic regressions, we find that a more positive father-child relationship predicts a reduced risk of engagement in first risky behaviors. Having a father with an authoritarian parenting style is associated with an increased risk of engaging in delinquent activity and substance use. Two-way interaction models indicate that the father-child relationship does interact with parenting styles (uninvolved parenting) to predict a reduced likelihood of risky behaviors.
0	Drawing on interview data and field observations from an Islamic full-time school in the Midwest, this study examines the roles that cultural and religious backgrounds play in the attitudes and teaching techniques of immigrant Muslim, American-born Muslims, and convert Muslim teachers in developing the religious identities of their students. All three groups underscore the educational and social function of the school in providing a comprehensive education for young Muslims born and raised in America.  Depending on their cultural or religious background though, the groups of teachers differ in the way they address and talk of issues regarding male to female student interaction, school dress code, religious pride, and the integration of Islamic concepts into other subjects of study. Nevertheless, all groups of teachers cite the schools isolation from the larger American (non-Muslim) society as a hindrance towards developing socially and religiously balanced generations of Muslims residing in America. However, only American-born (non-convert) teachers make concerted efforts to expose their students to other public school and community service events. The consensus among such teachers toward the need for a more inclusive and interactive Muslim-American experience (for their students) informs their desire to debunk prevailing stereotypes about Americans held by their students. Because the attitudes and behaviors of Islamic school teachers, as one segment of the larger Muslim community, are so diverse, these findings have important implications for understanding the intricacies surrounding the assimilation of Muslims in America.
0	Reliance on “disposable workers” is a characteristic of a contemporary job market. While research has focused on temporary workers, less attention has been paid to the phenomenon of “leadership on demand,” which is becoming more prevalent in the current economic situation. I use guest conductors in professional orchestras as an example of an interim manager. By relying on a qualitative approach, I explore the challenges guest conductors face in providing temporary leadership to multiple orchestras and explain the nature of domination in temporary organizational settings. I argue that successful domination is based on the use of both control and trust. My analysis of interim managers’ power deals with the following three questions: (1) How does temporality influence leader-subordinates relationships? (2) How can interim managers achieve legitimacy of their domination in a short period of time? (3) How does treating trust and control as mechanisms of domination change our understanding of trust-control relationships?
1	"This study examines how high school boys' and girls' academic effort, in the form of math coursetaking, is influenced by members of their social contexts. The authors argue that adolescents' social contexts are defined, in part, by clusters of students ( termed ""local positions"") who take courses that differentiate them from others. Using course transcript data from the recent Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement Study, the authors employ a new network algorithm to identify local positions in 78 high schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Incorporating the local positions into multilevel models of math coursetaking, the authors find that girls are highly responsive to the social norms in their local positions, which contributes to homogeneity within and heterogeneity between local positions."
1	This article revisits the Moving to Opportunity housing mobility experiment, which heretofore has not provided strong evidence to support the hypothesis of neighborhood effects on economic self-sufficiency among adults. The authors undertake a conceptual and empirical analysis of the study's design and implementation to gain a better understanding of the selection processes that occur within the study. The article shows that the study is potentially affected by selectivity at several junctures: in determining who complied with the program's requirements, who entered integrated versus segregated neighborhoods, and who left neighborhoods after initial relocation. Furthermore, previous researchers have not found an experimental treatment effect on adult economic self-sufficiency, relative to controls. The authors propose an alternative approach that involves measuring the cumulative amount of time spent in different neighborhood environments. With this method, they find evidence that neighborhood is associated with outcomes such as employment, earnings, TANF receipt, and use of food stamps.
1	"This research investigates the merits of the ""social causation"" and ""health selection"" explanations for associations between socioeconomic status and self-reported overall health, musculoskeletal health and depression. Using data that include information about individuals' SES and health from childhood through late adulthood, I employ structural equation models that account for errors in measured variables and that allow for explicit tests Of various hypotheses about how SES and health are related. For each outcome and for both women and men the results provide no support for the health selection hypothesis. SES affects each health outcome at multiple points in the life course, but the reverse is not true."
0	This paper inquires 1) how identity differences among family members has an influence on children’s health and 2) moderating effects of the state of Hawaii empirically. Several previous researches dealing with problems derived from identity difference considers that mental health is a subject of healing. Moreover, conventional researches focus on describing a process of acculturation rather than its impact on children’s health. Thus, in this paper, I want to cope with 1) the impact of family conflict in some conditions to children’s mental health and 2) consider the effect of Hawaii as a stress moderator. By doing so, I’d like to reveal causal relations between identity difference and its impacts on health in Hawaiian context. In order for that, I will analyze Hawaiian Health Survey data (version 2009) with OLS regression.
0	Social and political analysis tends to assume basic continuity.  But major discontinuities sometimes disrupt society and thinking about society.  In recent years a growing number of serious scholars have begun to address the possibility of social collapse, in particular collapse triggered by oil depletion as the global Hubbert’s Peak for oil is reached.  This paper develops a systematic typology of social collapse scenarios based on the existing literature but extrapolating to other as yet unexamined possibilities.  After identifying the parameters of social collapse, and several possible triggers in the present world-system, the focus is on what follows:  core-wide versus more regional scenarios and their implications for hegemony; effects in the semi-periphery and periphery; right, left and center political scenarios; centralized and decentralized scenarios; coal-intensive and clean/renewable energy scenarios; populations shifts; social experimentation; and prospects for system transformation.
0	Most social movement scholars attribute activists choices of strategies and tactics to rational decisions based on personal preferences, past experiences, or opponents abilities to sanction. But these explanations cannot account for instances when activists knowingly choose strategies and tactics that do not seem to offer the likeliest chance of success. What can account for these seemingly irrational choiceswhy would activists purposefully avoid likely successful strategies and tactics? I address this question through a comparative study of the animal rights movements in France and the United States, based on interviews and participant observation with activists in both countries. Activists in the U.S. exhibit more tactical pragmatism than French activists, who engage in tactical stubbornnesssometimes refusing tactics and strategies that have proven successful for others. I argue that these choices are not irrational, and surprisingly are not based on cultural or structural constraints external to the movement. Instead, they are indicative of the constraints placed on activists by the cultural structures within the animal rights movement itself. This meso-level analysis adds a new level to studies of tactical choices, and also provides a comparative perspective to an empirical case of cultural structures and agency.
0	Although women are still doing most of the domestic food work in the West, men are slowly moving into the kitchen. But as much of the research on the division of cooking focuses on continuity rather than change, we know little about the meanings of and motivations for domestic cooking among men cook a great deal. This paper attempts to address this gap by reporting on a study with involved male domestic cooks. The study used semi-structured interviews and cooking observations with 30 men in Toronto, Canada, who do a significant share of the cooking in their households. Key study questions were: Why are these men challenging traditional divisions of labour? and What does the traditionally female work of home cooking mean to them? Drawing on social constructionist and structural theories of gender, the paper explores the answers to these questions as well as their implications for gender equity. Findings include that 1) domestic cooking has become an acceptable part of some masculinities even though it has not become widely normalized, 2) the pleasures of cooking for involved male cooks draw on traditionally “masculine” and traditionally “feminine” positionings, and 3) for some men, not cooking (i.e. adhering to more traditional divisions of labour) can be seen as disadvantageous.
1	"How do multiracial groups ""fit"" into the system of racial oppression and privilege in the United States? Are the outcomes of multiracial individuals explained by the Latin Americanization hypothesis (Bonilla-Silva 2002), or a hardening racial divide between blacks and all other racial groups (Gans 1999; Yancey 2006)? Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I address these questions and show that the educational outcomes of multiracial groups and individuals are not consistently explained by measures of appearance, as suggested by these theories. Although the educational outcomes of Latinos and single-race groups are significantly associated with skin color and the racial perceptions of observers, multiracial young adults' high school and college educational outcomes are not consistently related to either measure of appearance. Parental education and family income are the most important predictors of educational outcomes for multiracial respondents across different types of outcomes. The implications of these findings for racial inequality and research on multiracial groups are discussed."

It does so by applying the principles associated with Granovetter's theory of strong and weak ties, drawing out its theoretical implications for the criminological theories and deriving a number of hypotheses. The article uses ""strategic research materials"" in the form of a data set strongly biased towards the social disability model and containing information on co-offending relations among a population (N = 580) of juveniles in a Swedish town during a three-year period. Results from cross-sectional empirical analyses using, among other things, the Quadratic Assignment Procedure, clearly support the social ability model. The robustness of the initial analyses is checked through longitudinal analyses applying actor-oriented statistical models for network evolution. The article's implications for criminological, as well as multidisciplinary, research are discussed."
0	In this paper I propose a framework to analyze the sustainability of liberalizing reforms in post-communist developing societies.  I argue that perhaps one of the most significant impediments for reforms in these countries is whether or not the leaders who carried the revolutionary insurgency are still in power.  For some, this inverse dichotomy can largely be explained by accounting for the personality and psychological aberrations of political leaders.  This explanation, however popular, fails to account the origins and steadfast disdain for reforms by these types of leaders and how their persuasion is sustained over time despite changing domestic and international political interests.  By comparing Cuba with China and Vietnam, I find that the longer the core revolutionary elite stays in power, the slower the pace of reforms and the more pronounce the tendencies towards dictatorial authoritarianism.  Thereafter, as new generations of leaders who did not participated or experienced the revolutionary insurgency first hand takes control, we will witness more political and economic reforms as is the cases in China today and to a lesser extent in Vietnam, but not in Cuba where Castros revolutionary cadres still effectively control much of the political power in the island.
0	The dynamics of social movements and the democratization of a political system are reciprocally interactive. However, social movements promote political democratization only in a specific context. Based on a case study of Korean womens movements, this paper illustrates that democratic consolidation progresses when social movements (1) raise issues susceptible to policy implementation, (2) use legitimate repertoires of collective action, and (3) have activists who participate in policy-making, while expanding their organizations and solidifying their collective identity and autonomy. Such blending of movement politics with institutional politics not only enables social movements to avoid co-optation but maximizes their impact on political change. Viewed as a strategy choice rather than a predestined outcome, social movement institutionalization is therefore the consequence both of a given social movements decision to participate in government and of the states desire to integrate such movements into its governmental structure. Joint movement-state decisions are then made under the increasing pressures of international organizations, democratizing political structures, and the strategic innovations and cognitive shifts of social movement organizations.
0	Much of the sociological and historical literature with regards to integration of Americas public schools takes for granted first, that all black parents wanted integration, and second, that the reasons for this included desires for assimilation in addition to access to better quality schooling.  Similarly, most authors fail to differentiate the interests of the most outspoken groups involved in this struggle, civil rights organizations, with those of community-based groups, such as parents.   This project examines the interests of various segments of the black community of New York City during the 1950s, a time often perceived as being one of quiet consensus, using contemporary black newspaper accounts of protests.  I seek to determine the interests of black activists with regard to the public schools during this era.  Findings suggest a clear difference between the desires of civil rights organizations and community-based parents with the former articulating desires for abstract ideals of integration and the latter far more intent on desires for improved educational welfare.  These findings have a number of implications for contemporary theorists and researchers as well as those concerned with educational policy for minority students.

Making use of the literature from sociology, political science, economics, anthropology and ethnic and gender studies, we examine how immigrants maneuver through the legalization process, and how their place vis a vis the law affords or denies them membership and rights. Although men and women share common experiences in the legalization process, their lived experiences and the legalization process often are vastly different. We explore some of these gender differences by relying on in-depth interviews with women and men from Mexico and Central America in Phoenix, conducted from 1998 through 2004. The data reveal that immigration policies reflect norms based on ideals of a nuclear family in which geographic origins, race, religion, gender and sexuality matter and continue to deny women full participation and inclusion in US society. Although immigration generates change for immigrant women, often this transformation remains embedded in a patriarchal order. As such, women for the most part, remain dependent on men through judicial, economic and cultural standards created by men that dictate the process to citizenship. This study suggests that, though in principle the law is gender neutral, gender emerges as a central organizing principle in the relationship immigrants have with immigration law from the very act of crossing the border (physical and legal) through the naturalization process.
0	A great deal of recent research has highlighted the political mobilizing activities of religious congregations. This research suggests that when mobilized, congregations potentially play an important role in helping to pass particular kinds of state-level ballot initiatives, such as those that restrict same-sex marriage. Past research has generally addressed the internal causes of congregational political activity such as organizational resources, authority structure, local theology, and sociodemographic characteristics of members.  In this article we examine whether social forces outside organizational boundaries spur congregational mobilization activity.  We hypothesize two ways this may happen: by the opportunity presented to congregations through ballot measures in a morally charged election environment or by perceived threat experienced by congregations, measured in terms of levels of tolerance of homosexuality in local contexts.  Our main questions are:  Do state-level opportunities or threats in relation to the issue of same-sex marriage influence congregational political mobilization?  If so, which congregational political activities are affected?  This research points to a mechanism for the organizational basis behind the much-cited connection between religious belief and opposition to same sex marriage, revealing the momentum that campaigns to ban same-sex marriage can have through local congregations.
0	The machismo culture is prevalent in many parts of the Caribbean and it hard to overstate the HIV-related risk that stems from machismo attitudes and related behaviours.  Jamaica has a machismo culture which is conducive to high levels of sexual activities and multiple partnerships among males, especially adolecents and young adults. Many young Jamaican males feel social pressure to engage in behaviours that are perceived to be masculine or machismo, without regard for the possible negative consequences. Therefore, 1632 sexually experienced male youth in Jamaica were surveyed about these attitudes and behaviours.  Overall, 48 percent- of the sample expressed some level of machismo attitudes.  These attitudes were significantly associated with the socio-demographic variables age, education, union state and employment status.  Rates of high-risk sexual behaviours were high including early age of sexual initiation, multiple partnerships and inconsistent condom use with both steady and non-steady partners.  Machismo attitudes were significantly associated withe the various high-risk behaviours including multiple partnerships, negative reactons to condom requests by sex partners and inconsistent condom use.  With respect to HIV/AIDS prevention for young Jamaican males, interventions need to include discussion of culture and promote positive machismo behaviours.  In addition, male role models should also be promoted for the positive impact they could have on these young men.
0	The objective of this paper is to reconsider and update Alvin Gouldners celebrated analysis of the social infrastructure of the Parsonian paradigm.  My argument is that the domain assumptions behind the Parsonian consensus in American sociology of the 1940s-60s are rooted in the particular historical pattern of the relationships between academics, including social scientists, and the government, including the intelligence community.  I refer to this pattern as the State-Academic Complex (SAC) and trace it back to the New Deal and, especially, the war effort and the establishment of the Big Science.  In this context, Parsonian sociology can be viewed as an intellectual current particularly resonant with the social agendas and political ideologies of the welfare state officials and the Cold War liberal elites as well as professionals searching for the shelter from free market in the service to the state.  In the course of the close reading of the Parsons FBI files and other previously classified materials, I also suggest that both McCarthyism and the 1968 movementdespite their vastly different agendascan be seen as instances of the resistance by the fractions of the elite and the broader public to the SAC.  In terms of its theoretical contributions, this paper criticizes Gouldners emphasis on macro-processes (industrialization, welfare state) in explaining the significance of an intellectual paradigm.  Building on Bourdieus analysis of intellectual fields and Randall Collins hierarchy of embedded levels in explaining ideas, I propose to focus on the institutions and networks at the interfiled nexus between political and academic fields.
1	Effects of material, social, and psychological incentives for giving and volunteering as well as socio-demographic and personality characteristics are studied in a factorial survey (n = 1248). Social incentives for giving strongly increase intentions to give money and time. Requests for more efficient ways of contributing as well as requests for contributions to local as opposed to (inter)national organizations are also More likely to be honored. More highly educated and more empathic respondents were more likely to intend giving and volunteering. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	We know too little about the effects of immigration on black Americans. If prior research yields mixed evidence about immigration's consequences for the objective well-being of African Americans, it is silent about effects of immigration on blacks' subjective well-being. To fill that void, this paper assesses the impact of the expanding Hispanic population on black Americans from a social psychological perspective. We ask whether blacks' self-reported distress, social distrust, or attitudes toward Hispanics and immigrants are affected by the size of the local Hispanic population or by the percentage growth in local Hispanic residents. Answers come from responses of non-Hispanic black participants in the 1998-2002 General Social Surveys, linked to 1990 and 2000 census data. Contrary to pessimistic claims, most social psychological outcomes, including measures of economic distress, manifest no impact of local Hispanic numbers. The four exceptions, significant effects of local Hispanic population share or percentage growth evenly split in valence, underscore the complexity of recent immigration's effects on African Americans.

0	In the wake of the considerable cultural changes and societal shifts that beset the United States and all advanced industrial democracies since the late 1960s and early 1970s, one can also observe a completely altered manner as to how humans in these societies have come to relate to animals, dogs in particular. One of the new institutions created by this novel attitude and behavior towards dogs has been the many breed rescues that emerged all over the United States beginning in the 1980s. Like many other institutions and structures in the world of human  animal relations, the world of dog rescue has also witnessed a massive preponderance of women at every level. In this paper, we present some key findings of research on canine breed rescue organizations in the state of Michigan, specifically addressing the question of why more women are involved in these organization than are men. While a blossoming scholarship on the changed dimension of the human  animal relationship attests to its social, political and intellectual salience to our contemporary world, we are reasonably certain that this work constitutes the first academic research on canine rescue and the people involved in it.
1	We examine the success of California's black, Latino, and Asian voters in ballot proposition elections, showing that minority voters lose more often than whites across all ballot propositions, and that this disadvantage is not limited to a small subset of racially-targeted propositions. Minority voters are 2-5 percentage points less likely than otherwise-similar white voters to be on the winning side of ballot propositions. These differences persist after excluding racially-targeted propositions because minority voters are more likely to lose on several issues including elections, the environment, health, housing, taxes, and transportation. We demonstrate that race is more important than class in describing which voters lose. 
1	Research into the effects of neighborhood characteristics on children s behavior has burgeoned in recent years but these studies have generally adopted a limited conceptualization of the spatial and temporal dimensions of neighborhood effects We use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and techniques of spatial data analysis to examine how both the socioeconomic characteristics of extralocal neighborhoods-neighborhoods surrounding the immediate neighborhood of residence and the duration of exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods throughout the childhood life course influence the likelihood of graduating from high school Among blacks and whites, socioeconomic advantage in the immediate neighborhood Increases the likelihood of completing high school but among whites higher levels of socioeconomic advantage in extralocal neighborhoods decrease high school graduation rates Extralocal neighborhood advantage suppresses the influence of advantage in the immediate neighborhood so that controlling for extralocal conditions provides stronger support for the neighborhood effects hypothesis than has previously been observed Exposure to advantaged neighborhoods over the childhood life course exerts a stronger effect than point-in-time measures on high school graduation, and racial differences in exposure to advantaged neighbors over the childhood life course help to suppress a net black advantage in the likelihood of completing high school 
0	Data from the National Adult Literacy Study indicate that returns to literacy skill vary across occupations.  In this paper, I explore two possible explanations for such differences: are returns to skill related (1) the skill demands of the occupation, and (2) the institutional factors  namely, the level of unionization, public sector employment, and self-employment  that govern the wage setting process within an occupation?  The findings suggest that both the skill demands and institutional characteristics of an occupation shape the importance of cognitive skill for earnings.  In particular, more cognitively demanding and manual occupations decrease the returns to skill, while increased interpersonal skill demands strengthen the skills-earnings relationship.  Heavily unionized occupations along with occupations with a greater percentage of public sector workers decrease the importance of skills for earnings, but higher levels of self-employment within an occupation tend to increase returns to skill for workers.
1	This study informs family and child health research by using longitudinal Fragile Families data to assess how family structure and transitions are associated with changes in children's BMI and weight status between ages three and five. Concerns in family structure literature about biases due to selectivity are reduced through the use of change score models and by controlling for parental BMI. The findings indicate unhealthy BMI gain and an increased risk of becoming overweight/obese among children living with a mother who recently dissolved a union or had been living without a partner for at least 2 years compared with those in stable married parent families. Children with single mothers who entered a new union had significantly healthier BMI trajectories than those whose mothers remained single or recently became single. These results suggest the importance of two-parent family contexts for children's healthy physical development, and that single mothers may need additional support to better manage their children's BMI. 
0	Information and communication technologies have introduced new and impressive tools for information sharing and building computer mediated knowledge networks without borders. In the age of the Internet, patients are able to build their adaptive coping and self-care skills by collecting information from various digital sources. This represents a significant step in modern medicine. This paper provides a discussion on how integration of the Internet information resources into illness management changes patient role. This discussion is placed within a larger context of the U.S. health care system, as this is seen as key to determining the impact of the Internet on patient health care behavior.
1	Although risk assessments are critical inputs to economic and organizational decision-making, we lack a good understanding of the social and political causes of shifts in risk perceptions and the consequences of those changes. This article uses social movement theory to explain the effect of environmental activism on corporations' perceived environmental risk and actual financial performance. We define environmental risk as audiences' perceptions that a firm's practices or policies will lead to greater potential for an environmental failure or crisis that would expose it to financial decline. Using data on environmental activism targeting U.S. firms between 2004 and 2008, we examine variation in the effectiveness of secondary and primary stakeholder activism in shaping perceptions about environmental risk. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that primary stakeholder activism against a firm affects its perceived environmental risk, which subsequently has a negative effect on the firm's financial performance.
1	This article examines the role of family structure in the financial support parents provide for their children's college education. Data are from the Health and Retirement Study. We focus on aspects of family structure that affect parental support and estimate shared family variance in investments as well as within-family variation using a multilevel model. Family membership accounts for about 60% of the variance in payment of college costs. Small family size, living with both biological parents (compared to one biological parent and a stepparent), higher parental education, and having older parents are associated with greater parental expenditures. 
0	This paper builds on previous quantitative work, which looked at the effects of neighborhood resources on economic mobility.  The initial quantitative study population included 526 women who moved into subsidized housing throughout Chicago and its surrounding metropolitan suburbs.  The results showed significant differences in the womens economic independence based on the level of resources and segregation in their Gautreaux neighborhood.  Women initially placed in neighborhoods with few Black residents and moderate to high neighborhood resources significantly decreased welfare receipt and increased time employed when compared to women who moved to areas with high Black populations and a low level of resources.  This study provides insight into complex social processes such as how the women created and maintained social networks in city and suburban communities with various levels of racial segregation and resources.  In addition to looking at the role of neighborhoods and social networks in mobility, this study also explores the effect of historical context and the womens developmental timing.  Without fail, the participants viewed the move to their new communities as beneficial and providing them with access to jobs, social supports or a combination of both.  The women emotionally discuss how historical changes in racial and gender relations affected their economic mobility.  Lastly, we see how the women strategically combine their developmental goals and trajectories with the Gautreaux opportunities and create better life chances for themselves and their families.
1	"This article retrieves the ethnic roots that underlie a universalist class ideology. Focusing empirically on the emergence of Bolshevism, it provides biographical analysis of the Russian Revolution's elite, finding that two-thirds were ethnic minorities from across the Russian Empire. After exploring class and ethnicity as intersectional experiences of varying significance to the Bolsheviks' revolutionary politics, this article suggests that socialism's class universalism found affinity with those seeking secularism in response to religious tensions, a universalist politics where ethnic violence and sectarianism were exclusionary, and an ethnically neutral and tolerant ""imperial"" imaginary where Russification and geopolitics were particularly threatening or imperial cultural frameworks predominated. The claim is made that socialism's class universalism was as much a product of ethnic particularism as it was constituted by it."
1	"With data from random sample household surveys conducted simultaneously in major cities in Greece and in Russia, we evaluate the import of individuals' morality relative to expected utility and self-control in predicting criminal probability. In addition, we examine potential interactions among the three variables in predicting criminal propensity and compare their relative effects across the two samples. The results suggest that all three factors are important and mostly independent influences in explaining criminal probability. However, the estimated effects of morality are substantially stronger than those of either expected utility or self-control, and all three of these explanatory variables appear to be somewhat sensitive to cultural contexts. Overall, our findings confirm that morality plays a comparatively larger part in explaining conformity than is generally recognized by major contemporary theories, although the data cannot show whether morality is an element in rational decision making or represents a contrary ""non-rational"" element in accounting for human conduct.

1	This article uses Academy Award nominations for acting to explore how artistic achievement is situated within a collaborative context. Assessment of individual effort is particularly difficult in film because quality is not transparent, but the project-based nature of the field allows us to observe individuals in multiple collaborative contexts. We address these issues with analyses of the top-10 credited roles from films released in theaters between 1936 and 2005. Controlling for an actor's personal history and the basic traits of a film, we explore two predictions. First, we find that status, as measured by asymmetric centrality in the network of screen credits, is an efficient measure of star power and mediates the relationship between experience and formal artistic consecration. Second, we find that actors are most likely to be consecrated when working with elite collaborators. We conclude by arguing that selection into privileged work teams provides cumulative advantage.
0	This paper takes a clue from the incipient movement in the social sciences aiming to complement the traditional preoccupation with discursive dimensions of cultural life with the embodied forms of social phenomena.  In particular, it seeks to extend the paradigm of embodiment and the pragmatist notion of bodymind to interpretation theory, suggesting the way we can turn body and emotion into a hermeneutical resource.  The discussion begins with the classical tradition which equates meaning with logical sense and then contrasts this theoretical commitment with the pragmatism-inspired approach that brings into the interpretation process somatic, emotional, and behavioral signs.
0	Mixing self-selected images of abuse from the Abu Ghraib prison scandal with religious imagery taken from abroad, this paper makes commentary on the abuses fostered there. The author notes that this paper is not intended to be an in-depth historical or a sociological treatise explaining the abuse at Abu Ghraib. Rather, this work is a visual semiotic experiment crafted primarily to combat a moral blindness that allows individuals to ignore, or even to justify such degradation and brutality. In appropriating and re-mixing these images I seek to transform them into anti-torture messages that call out and question political motives and justifications for the use of torture.
0	A multilevel root cause theory, the racism-race reification process (R3p), is proposed to address why segregation is neither monolithically bad for Blacks nor monolithically good for Latinos (herein referred to as “the segregation paradox”). R3p situates the reification of race as the key factor in how racism creates multiple sites of risk for racially marginalized youth and racially segregated places. The reification of race informs why living in a racial ghetto (e.g., percent non-Whites) is detrimental to health, whereas living in an ethnic enclave (e.g., percent Latino) or living in a melting point (e.g., Theil’s Entropy Index) is not. Using a unique multilevel dataset created with data from the Project of Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Neighborhood Change Database, the dissertation focuses on understanding the micro (individual) and macro (neighborhood) predictors of seven types of health problems – lead poisoning, asthma, obesity, mental distress, poor physical health days, restricted activity days, and other health problems. Lead poisoning is used as the comparative case, since it is an environmental health problem more prevalent among racial/ethnic minorities. An empirical study will be conducted that evaluates the independent and mediating effects of isolating social structures (i.e., racial, ethnic, and economic residential segregation) and racist relational structures (i.e., institutionalized deprivation based on marginalized people and places). The study concludes by evaluating the usefulness of R3p in clarifying current understandings of racial inequalities in health.
1	"What led modern colonizers to treat their subject populations in radically differing ways, ranging from genocide to efforts to ""salvage"" precolonial cultures? In Southwest Africa, Germany massacred the Ovaherero and Witbooi; in Samoa, Germany pursued a program of cultural retraditionalization; and in the Chinese leasehold colony of Qingdao/Kiaochow. the Germans moved from policies of racialized segregation to a respectful civilizational exchange. Bourdieu is not generally seen as a theorist of empire, despite the partial genesis of his lifelong research program in the late colonial crucible of French Algeria (Bourdieu 1958; Yacine 2004). Nonetheless, Bourdieu theoretical work-most notably his conceptions of field and capital-helps solve the main riddle of the colonial state. Different European social groups competed inside the colonial state field for a specific form of symbolic capital: ethnographic capital. This involved exhibiting an alleged talent for judging the culture and character of the colonized, a gift for understanding ""the natives."" Competitive dynamics among the colonial rulers decisively shaped the ongoing production of native policies. Policy formation was also influenced by geopolitical and economic interests, responses by the colonized, and the metropolitan government final authority in appointing and dismissing colonial officials. The effects of these additional mechanisms were typically mediated by the internal dynamics of the semi-autonomous colonial state."
1	"This article examines the neighborhood characteristics that affect bias crime and compares bias crime to other kinds of criminal offending. Two frequently asserted arguments are tested. The first argument is that bias crime is like other criminal offenses in that it is more likely to occur in communities with high levels of social disorganization. The second argument is that bias crime is unique in that it occurs as a defense against neighborhood in-migration of ethnic ""others""-the so-called ""defended neighborhoods"" argument. Findings show that accounting for the spatial distribution of bias crime requires both perspectives. Bias crime, like robbery, assault, and vandalism, is more likely to occur in neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage and residential turnover, two of the three factors identified in social disorganization research. However, unlike other kinds of crime, holding constant attributes of disorganization, the effect of nonwhite in-migration on bias crime is greater in neighborhoods with a high percentage of white residents than communities with a low percentage of white residents. This confirms the central empirical implication of the defended neighborhoods perspective. Additional analyses show that these effects hold in analyses of specifically anti-black bias crimes and violent bias crimes. The conclusion suggests that research on social problems like bias crime should balance the emphasis on the unique features of the problem with attention to the common generative processes that the problem shares with a wider set of behaviors and outcomes."
0	This paper aims to explore the effects of institutional transition on control systems and performance. Drawn on contingency theory, the mechanisms of governance on State-owned assets have the potential to impact firms’ performance through strategy formulation and its implementation by strategy performance management systems (SPMS). Using a survey sample gathered from 247 senior managers in Chinese manufacturing industry at firm level, five hypotheses were examined. First, the results of empirical analysis indicate governmental regulation control over firms positively and significantly impact the formulation of customer satisfaction driven strategy through the support of appointed board members. Second, governmental regulation control over firms and the appointed board members is significantly associated with the use of financial performance measures and the communication of using performance measures. The implementation of customer satisfaction driven strategy is associated with four attributes of SPMS (financial and non-financial performance measures, communication, and decentralisation). Third, firms’ performance is enhanced through the use of financial performance measures and communication.
0	Profound shifts in employment relations, manifested in changes in the standard employment contract and the rise of nonstandard forms of employment, herald the advent of a new economy. While these changes in the labor market are likely to have important consequences for social stratification, they have not been sufficiently analyzed. This paper focuses on the issue of occupational sex segregation and asks the question: What does the emergence of a new economy hold for gender equality in employment? The paper explores the profiles of occupational sex segregation in two nonstandard employment regimes, contingent and part-time, and compares them to that in standard employment. Profiles of occupational sex segregation in nonstandard and standard employment follow the same global pattern. However, notable differences in segregation profiles across employment regimes exist. The main finding of the paper is that the overall degree of sex segregation is lower in contingent employment than in the standard full-time working arrangement or part-time employment and maybe explained by the hypothesis of segregation-producing bureaucratic features of standard employment, competitive forces within contingent employment, or a combination of both.
1	The social and human capital that educational attainment provides women enables them to better navigate their children's passages through school. In this study, we examine a key mechanism in this intergenerational process: mothers' selection of early child care. Analyses of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development revealed that maternal education was positively associated. with configurations of child-care characteristics (i.e., type, quality, quantity) most closely linked to children's school readiness. This association was not solely a function of mother's income or employment status, persisted despite controls for many observable confounds (e.g., maternal cognitive and psychological skills, paternal characteristics), and, according to post-hoc indices, was fairly robust in terms of unobservable confounds.
1	This article presents the first large-scale audit study of discrimination against openly gay men in the United States. Pairs of fictitious resumes were sent in response to 1,769 job postings in seven states. One resume in each pair was randomly assigned experience in a gay campus organization, and the other resume was assigned a control organization. Two main findings have emerged. First, in some but not all states, there was significant discrimination against the fictitious applicants who appeared to be gay. This geographic variation in the level of discrimination appears to reflect regional differences in attitudes and antidiscrimination laws. Second, employers who emphasized the importance of stereotypically male heterosexual traits were particularly likely to discriminate against openly gay men. Beyond these particular findings, this study advances the audit literature more generally by covering multiple regions and by highlighting how audit techniques may be used to identify stereotypes that affect employment decisions in real labor markets.
0	"My paper examines how punk and alternative rock subcultures have created their own commercially independent media, such as independent record labels and fanzines, through a so-called ""do-it-yourself ethic."" The formation of independent media is a response to the growing concentration of power among corporate conglomerates in the entertainment and music industries. The do-it-yourself ethic gives people involved with punk and alternative rock music democratic access to a means of creative expression, empowering them to be cultural participants rather than just consuming spectators. In many cases, it also enables them to use music as a vehicle of protest and activism, a kind of ""public sphere"" that gives voice to viewpoints marginalized by mainstream media while facilitating dialogue about critical social issues. My paper gives special attention to the ""riot grrrl"" movement and subculture, a collective of young women who sought to revitalize feminism by using fanzines and music as media for consciousness-raising and community organizing."
1	Previous studies find that workers of longer work weeks report more market hours in stylized measure than in time diary, while those of shorter work weeks report fewer hours. Using data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) 2003-2007, this paper attempts to explain this dilemma. I argue that market work time is composed of activity time, committed time, and constrained time. Thus, part of the difference found between the two estimates is due to the calculation of the diary estimate. I also argue that the wording of the stylized question is consequential. Some stylized questions (e.g., How many hours per week do you usually work?) might capture the mode, instead of the mean, of work time. Thus, when the distribution of work time is skewed, the mismatch between the two estimates is expected. A sequence-based identification for diary estimate and a non-parametric adjustment for stylized estimate are proposed and empirically examined. The result indicates that both methods significantly reduce the observed gap between the two estimates. I discuss the implications for future time use survey design in the concluding section. 
0	In this study, the following two questions are examined: (1) is parent, peer, and teacher social capital related to how much effort students exert in school, and (2) does student effort explain parent, peer, and teacher social capital effects on student learning?  The results indicate that parent discussion, expectations, limit setting, and monitoring is related to how much effort students exert.  The normative peer climate and peer modeling also affect student effort.  Parent and peer social capital is also related to student achievement.  Student effort explains some of the effects of peer social capital on student achievement, but explains little of the parent social capital effects.
1	How do social policies shape life courses, and which consequences do different life course patterns hold for individuals? This article engages the example of retirement in Germany and Britain to analyze life course patterns and their consequences for income inequality. Sequence analysis is used to measure retirement trajectories. The liberal welfare state in Britain generates more unstable retirement trajectories (differentiated) that are more dissimilar across the population (de-standardized) than the conservative-corporatist welfare state in Germany. Contrary to common conjectures, this is not associated with higher income inequality among retirees in Britain. This study concludes that there is no simple straightforward link between life course patterns and income inequality.
1	industrial effects have long been significant factors in wage inequality. Previous research indicates that wage differentials across industries were increasing through the mid 1980s. Using more recent data, however, we find that the level of inter-industry wage dispersion declined by 36% from 1986 to 2002 despite the continued trend towards increasing inequality in the labor force. This decline in inter-industry wage dispersion is evident across gender and educational groups. Using multilevel growth curve models, our multivariate results indicate that the decline is only weakly related to industrial changes in education, occupation or even productivity despite the fact that the latter variable had been a critical factor in the prior period. Indicators of globalization and downsizing also do not appear to explain this decline. For the more recent period, the most important factors associated with the narrowing of inter-industry wage dispersion are reduced unionization rates and the higher proportion of casual workers. We interpret these results as suggesting that firms may now be less economically obliged to pass on a portion of their rents to broad groups of workers and may instead be engaged in more idiosyncratic processes of negotiation with individual workers based on micro-level sources of bargaining power.

0	"Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, this paper delineates a process through which members of an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Los Angeles unintentionally delegate boundary work and membership-identification to anonymous others in everyday life. Living in the midst of a non-Jewish world, orthodox men are often approached by others, both Jews and non-Jews, who categorize them as ""religious Jews"" based on external marks such as the yarmulke and attire. These interactions, varying from mundane interactions to anti-Semitic incidents, are then tacitly anticipated by members even when they are not attending to their ""Jewishness""when being a ""Jew"" is interactionally invisible. Through this case, I argue that in addition to conceptualizing boundaries and identifications as either emerging in performance or institutionally given and stable, the study of boundaries should also chart the sites in which members anticipate categorization, and the way these anticipations play out in everyday life."
0	In the late 1700s, condoms were luxury items for the affluent in Western Europe, but by the 1970s, the US government gave free condoms out to poor women in Third World areas. Moreover condom availability has increased dramatically since the global emergence of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s, adding to the already fervent social stigmatization and political contentions on morality, sexuality, and wellbeing that condom use brings. This paper focuses on the strategically joint-relationship between manufacturing firms and governments to foster distinct profit-oriented condom social relations and moral-symbolic regimes of sexual cultures. Proposing a sex-situated theory of capitalist firms, the paper examines the crucial social aspect of condom production, focusing on the changes in the condom manufacturing industry from its initial colonial-warfare period (1880s-1930s), its period of massive welfare-state expansion (1940s-1970s), and its recent neoliberal consolidation (1980s-2000s).
0	Some recent evidence suggests that gender may be losing its status significance, at least among college students.  We report a questionnaire study directly assessing status effects of gender for such a population.  Our results indicate that gender still operates as both a specific and a diffuse status characteristic, for both the men and the women in our study. We also present a new social desirability scale to measure whether respondents try to present themselves as egalitarian.  We place our results in the context of other findings and discuss implications for future investigations of genders status effects.
0	This paper explores the value of using a typology-based approach to understand school inequality.  First, I use survey data on school climate from the nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) to identify distinct clusters of schools (using traditional cluster analysis methods as well as latent class cluster methods).  Then, using census data on the schools geographic locations, as well as demographic and structural characteristics of the schools themselves, I explore the utility of describing socioeconomic, racial, and geographic disparities in school quality using the typology method.
0	Exploring the relationship between nationalism and economic transactions, this paper is interested in how nationalist sentiments influence foreign investment exchanges. In particular, I examine how nationality affiliations shape the types of commitments that actors will want to realize through foreign investment transactions, and how cultural conceptions of nationality influence the evaluation of potential partners in economic transactions. I also stipulate when nationality conceptions play a more or less salient role in economic exchange. The evidence comes from interviews with actors involved in foreign investment attempts in which investors from the West try to acquire firms in postsocialist Slovenia. The analysis is grounded in the cultural economic sociology and advances a relational understanding of national identity, seen as embedded in actors cultural repertoires, situationally invoked, and negotiated in interactions.
0	This paper investigates how products of material culture can become cultural icons. Employing ideas from the culture of production perspective, this research traces the changes in US society leading the creation and increased value of specific electric guitars. A content analysis of guitar magazine covers demonstrates the electric guitar’s increased importance over time. The paper discusses more broadly how this case demonstrates the role of production of culture and the relationship to broader social changes.
0	Genes affect normal behaviors as well as medical and psychological disorders. Cultural processes shape whether the objects of genetic influence are interpreted as normal or pathological. The case of depression shows how these processes reinforce the view of depression as a mental disorder. In contrast, finding a putative gene for homosexuality did not lead to pathologization. The different interpretation of genetic findings regarding depression and homosexuality indicate the importance of social sequencing on the interpretation of genetic effects.
1	This study helps to fill a significant gap in the literature on organizations and inequality by investigating the central role of merit-based reward systems in shaping gender and racial disparities in wages and promotions. The author develops and tests a set of propositions isolating processes of performance-reward bias, whereby women and minorities receive less compensation than white men with equal scores on performance evaluations. Using personnel data from a large service organization, the author empirically establishes the existence of this bias and shows that gender, race, and nationality differences continue to affect salary growth after performance ratings are taken into account, ceteris paribus. This finding demonstrates a critical challenge faced by the many contemporary employers who adopt merit-based practices and policies. Although these policies are often adopted in the hope of motivating employees and ensuring meritocracy, policies with limited transparency and accountability can actually increase ascriptive bias and reduce equity in the workplace.
1	The rise in singlehood among young adults is often seen as an indication that young adults are nowadays more individualized, suggesting that singlehood is viewed as a positive experience. Using the Panel Study of Social Integration in the Netherlands, we examined singles' (N = 836) relational attitudes across young adulthood. Singles were not very positive about singlehood and a large majority felt more positive about a partner relationship than about being alone. Most singles were also more positive about living together than about steady dating and cohabitation was more popular than marriage. We furthermore examined whether values, life-course experiences and ageing influence singles' relational attitudes. Value orientations and age proved to be the most consistent predictors. Singles with liberal values and older singles had less positive attitudes toward relational commitment than less liberal and younger singles. The findings suggest that the positive image of singlehood needs to be reconsidered. 
0	The economic downturn and subsequent recession have provided the first test of the U.S. safety net since passage of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity and Reconciliation Act (PRWORA).  PRWORA embodied neoliberalism’s tenant that the role of the state is to promote behaviors and activities that support the market In this paper I ask the questions, what are the options for low-income women during a recession, and how do they make sense of their current economic situation?  I use five rounds of qualitative interview data, gathered yearly between 2006 and 2010, from a sample of 39 low-income women living in metropolitan Detroit to document the extent to which low-income women seek out and receive public benefits and assistance from their private safety nets and the ways in which the availability of help has changed as the economy worsened.  I also analyze responses about women’s expectations for help, particularly from the government, finding that women hope for very little beyond opportunities to find employment.  Given how little the safety net has provided them, their expectations are realistic, and unfortunately, low-income women have learned that they can only rely upon themselves.
0	This study builds on World Society theory that suggests the importance of international organizations for influencing national policy and uses statistical techniques to compare the effects of international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) on social spending levels across 18 Latin American and 18 OECD countries from 2002-2008. I define two major categories of INGOs and examine their effects on social spending levels within and across regions. Social Justice INGOs include groups focusing on human rights, environment, women, indigenous, and activist oriented organizations. Business and Professional INGOs tend to focus on providing links between workers in similar industries around the world, bettering the conditions for a certain economic sector or profession, and dismantling barriers to business and trade that may hamper their economic sector. I hypothesize that Social Justice INGOs has positive associations with all types of social spending in Latin America due to their activist and human rights oriented natures. Conversely, I hypothesize that OECD countries are less likely to succumb to the pressure Social Justice INGOs due to their economic and political clout. Business and Professional INGOs will have varying associations with social spending. This is due in part to conflicting interests amongst different economic sectors. Additionally, I hypothesize that Latin America and the OECD nations may find it more difficult to withstand the pressure Business and Professional INGOs can exert given their participation in the neoliberal project. I test these World Society indicators against classical welfare state theories to illustrate the growing importance of international organizations on national social policy.
1	Existing explanations of tokenism predict similar experiences for all numerically small, low-status groups. These explanations, however, cannot account for variation in the experiences of different low-status minority groups within the same setting. This article develops a theory of tokenism that explains such variation. Drawing on 117 interviews in the leveraged buyout industry (LBO) and a comparison of the differing experiences of female and African American male tokens in that setting, I argue that tokenism is contingent on the local cultural context in which it is embedded. Specifically, I identify two elements of an occupation's culture-its hierarchy of cultural resources and its image of the ideal worker-that can specify some status characteristics as more relevant to and incompatible with the occupation's work than others. In LBO, the industry values cultural resources that, on average, women lack but men possess, and the ideal worker is defined such that it directly conflicts with cultural beliefs about motherhood. Consequently, in this context, gender is a more relevant status characteristic for exclusion than is race, and female tokens are differentially disadvantaged. In addition to revising received wisdom about tokenism, this study integrates and advances social psychological and cultural theories of exclusion by deepening our understanding of the role of cultural resources and schemas in occupational inequality.
0	Employment environments, like school contexts, may be those of opportunity for some, but not others. Some jobs may facilitate positive socialization by promoting the soft or non-cognitive skills that facilitate successful transitions into adulthood (including post-secondary education and career-track employment) while others may do the opposite. Prior research has made strides to illuminate the complex relationships between ascription, social class, race/ethnicity and gender, achievement, and work patterns of adolescents. However, the relationship between household structure and resources available to the adolescents and their employment patterns is poorly understood. In this paper, I present evidence that family resources differentially impact work trajectories of students by gender. In addition, this paper aims to unpack gendered patterns of adolescent work by examining the variation in occupational sectors in which students are employed.
0	Subsidized by a vast array of public expenditures, America’s homeownership rate has risen steadily since President Hoover’s Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership in the early 1930s.  As the country’s commitment to homeownership has deepened, political leaders as diverse as Franklin Delano Roosevelt and George W. Bush have endorsed homeownership as a central attribute of good citizenship.  Several studies have affirmed this belief, noting that homeowners participate more regularly in civic affairs, vote more frequently in local elections, and are more likely to know the names of their public officials.  However, this descriptive evidence offers little confirmation that homeownership itself drives this association, rather than other covariates associated with homeownership (e.g., income, education). This paper examines nearly two-dozen types of civic and political participation from the Current Population Survey to ask whether – and in what ways – homeownership affects civic involvement.  From measures of formal political participation (voting, working on campaigns, attending political meetings) to neighborliness (talking with neighbors, doing favors for neighbors) to participating in community activities (volunteering, involvement in a community group), the project assesses whether the ideal of homeownership as an impetus for improved civic involvement holds true in reality.  Given the recent policy focus on expanding homeownership opportunities in low-income communities, the research pays particular attention to the effects of homeownership for low-income Americans.  The paper ultimately challenges the longstanding belief that the transition to homeownership leads citizens to engage more actively in their communities.
1	This paper proposes a model of selective mobility of workers from the state sector to the market sector to illustrate how the market transition has led to earnings inequality in former state socialist countries. Analysis of the survey data collected in 2000 from 10 Chinese cities reveals that recent entrants into the market are driven by two different institutional processes some are self-selected for higher economic returns (voluntary entrants) and some are pushed into the market through layoffs (involuntary entrants), resulting in a more heterogeneous body of workers in the market sector than before. Linear regression results show that the commonly observed higher earnings in the market sector are limited only to a subgroup of later entrants who enter the sector voluntarily. Propensity-score matching analyses further demonstrate that the effect of a late market entry on earnings is negatively associated with the propensity of making such a transition. Those who would otherwise do well in the state sector and therefore have a lower propensity for entering the market benefit more from the entry. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	"The goal of ""college-for-all"" in the United States has been pursued in an environment of rising tuition, stagnant grant aid and already strapped family budgets with the gap filled by college loans. College students are thus facing increasing levels of debt as they seek to develop their human capital and improve their career options. Debt is a useful resource for making needed investments. It is unique as a resource, however, because it must be repaid and can thus also increase vulnerabilities and limit options. We find that lower levels of educational debt do support college completion. However, additional educational debt beyond about $10,000 actually reduces the likelihood of college completion compared to lower levels of debt as the burden of repayment looms. Graduation likelihoods for students from the bottom 75% of the income distribution at public universities are especially influenced by debt. The article considers how the macro-level changes in financing societal functions influence the individual-level risks and vulnerabilities of life in a debt-based society."
1	A confining limitation for the occupational sex segregation literature has been the inability to determine how many persons of one sex would have entered an occupation had the other sex not successfully entered instead. Using panel data from all American colleges of veterinary medicine (1976-1995), a fixed-effects model with lagged independent variables finds support for the concurrent effects of many hypothesized feminization mechanisms. Declining relative earnings and policies aimed at increasing production of graduates affect applications from men and women similarly, but feminization is driven by the decline in men's college graduation and their avoidance of fields dominated by women. The findings demonstrate the relative contributions and interdependence of supply and demand to occupational sex composition and the job search process more broadly.
0	This paper discusses how twenty second generation Korean American college women participate in a process of othering whereby individuals who self-identify as of the same race and gender create social boundaries among one another through language that reflects and perpetuates particular hierarchies originally put forth by the dominant society.  In an effort to extend sociological understandings regarding identity formation, this piece focuses on othering as it reveals the social construction of race and gender without giving primacy to one form of inequality.  Consistent with scholarship that identifies college as a key time period for individual exploration and self-definition, I aim to contribute to a better understanding of how youth and Asian American youth, in particular, make sense of their racialized/gendered identities.

0	During the latter part of the twentieth century, a major restructuring of production workplaces around the world has occurred. Despite the myth that colleges and universities are  ivory towers resistant to change, institutions of higher education have also undergone dramatic changes during the same time period, changes which are clearly linked to changes in the corporate sector in certain ways.  The growing literature on corporatization has begun to explore these linkages As instructive as the corporatization literature is, however, this paper argues that in order to better understand contemporary  university restructuring, we need to compare academic workplaces with corporate workplaces so as to reveal both the continuities and the differences. In what follows, I begin with a discussion of  recent changes in academic workplaces. I  then discuss major trends in contemporary corporate restructuring. Next, I compare recent patterns of corporate and university restructuring so as to reveal both the continuities and the discontinuities between them. Finally, I discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these changes, both for higher education and for society in general.
0	This paper considers the mix of factors contributing to the decline in tuberculosis (TB) in 1950s China.  The 1950s decline of TB coincided with establishment of the work-unit system, an urban employment system under which the vast majority of urban adults had guaranteed employment and other benefits.  Among the benefits, work units provided health insurance and served as the channel into the medical system.    Using archival and interview data gathered during 16 months of fieldwork in Shanghai, I examine how creation of the work unit system made TB prevention, monitoring, and treatment widely available to the urban population.  Prior to the Communist victory in 1949, TB prevention, monitoring, and treatment only reached a sliver of the urban population.  In the early 1950s, a number of developments helped to contribute to the decline in disease: an inoculation campaign, widespread education campaigns, widespread check-ups and chest X-rays, and availability of effective antibiotics.  Work units made these developments available by linking the population to the health and healthcare system.
1	Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and three US. censuses, we examine how the composition of extralocal areas-areas surrounding a householder's neighborhood of residence-shapes the likelihood that Whites will move out of their neighborhoods. Net of local neighborhood conditions and other predictors of residential mobility, high concentrations of minorities in surrounding neighborhoods reduce the likelihood that Whites will move, presumably by reducing the attractiveness of nearby residential alternatives. Notably, this effect also suppresses the influence of the racial composition of the immediate neighborhood on White out-migration. Recent growth in the size of an extralocal minority population increases the likelihood of White out-migration and accounts for much of the influence previously attributed to racial changes in the local neighborhood. High levels of minority concentration in surrounding neighborhoods also exacerbate the positive effect of local minority concentration on White out-migration. These results highlight the importance of looking beyond reactions to local racial conditions to understand mobility decisions and resulting patterns of segregation.

1	School sector and educational context seem to make a difference in civic socialization. There is limited knowledge, however, of the mechanisms through which socialization may occur in public and private schools, and the extent to which they have any lasting effect. Does the private school effect on civic socialization persist into young adulthood, and if it does, what explains the effect? Analyzing data from NELS:88 using HLM, the results of this study show that, net of background controls, there is a private school effect on civic participation in young adulthood, but it is mediated through contextual factors in the family and school-such as parent-school involvement, intergenerational closure, student-teacher relationships and prior participation that seem to account for the effect on adult civic behavior.
0	We study differences in gender wage inequality across the OECD countries and how they are affected by welfare state characteristics. Previous research has neglected the possibility that both gender wage gaps and the impact of welfare states on them vary by class. Our analysis decomposes the gender wage gap into its class and gender components. In the same vein, we propose differentiating the impact of the welfare state between its effects on class inequality (decommodification) and gender inequality (defamilialization). We also stress the distinct role of welfare states as employers. This makes for a series of hypotheses which this paper begins to test by operationalizing classes as earnings quintiles. Empirically our case rests on a comparative study of gender gaps in 12 countries, using micro-data from the Luxembourg Income Study. The results support our expectations, and they sharpen understanding of the differences between the Scandinavian and American welfare regimes. Social democracy massively brings women into the labor market and broadly supports their earnings position by narrowing overall earnings differentials between classes. But it also appears to hamper the upward mobility of advantaged women.
1	Occupations with a greater share of females pay less than those with a lower share, controlling for education and skill. This association is explained by two dominant views: devaluation and queuing. The former views the pay offered in art occupation to affect its female proportion, due to employers' preference for men-a gendered labor queue. The latter argues that the proportion of females in an occupation affects pay, owing to devaluation of work done by women. Only a few past studies used longitudinal data, which is needed to test the theories. We use fixed-effects models, thus controlling for stable characteristics Of Occupations, and U.S. Census data from 1950 through 2000. We find substantial evidence for the devaluation view, but only scant evidence for the queuing view.
0	Recent developments in neuroscience and cognitive science point towards the vital role that social interactions play in shaping the brain.  I argue that understanding how social interactions shape the brain leads to significant and compelling alternative treatment options, and research, for mental illnesses such as ADHD, depression and Alzheimer’s.  These treatment options have important implications for American social, legal, and health policies regarding the mentally ill.  Specifically, I first highlight the how mental illness is defined and understood in the United States.  I then identify and describe three key brain disorders in terms of their neurological basis, etiology, clinical criteria and diagnostic processes, standard treatment protocol and outcomes, and a neurosociological perspective.  I then discuss alternative treatment options for these disorders, based on the few such programs in the United States as well as those found in other countries, which reflect a neurosociological sensibility.  I conclude by highlighting the impact of a neurosociology of mental health for changing the way mental illness is addressed in the United States.
0	This study assesses the effect of contact use with individual selection strategies considered. With the assumption that unmeasured and measured variables influence the probability of using contacts and the subsequent outcome simultaneously, I used Endogenous Switching Regression models to estimate the effect of using contacts on income attainment for individuals first jobs. Results show that the income gap between females using and not using contacts is solely because female non contact users are the weakest in the labor market. Rather than them not using contacts per se, their unmeasured traits which do not fit the demands of the labor market make them end up earning the least among male and female contact and non contact users. Using contacts benefits male contact users, but this advantage is based on comparisons with male contact users in a hypothetical situation of them not using contacts. Actually, the difference in income between male contact and non contact users is trivial, since not using contacts does not dampen, but instead benefits income attainment for male non contact users. I thereby argue OLS estimations upwardly biases the effect of using contacts for females, and fail to reflect the positive role of contact use for male contact users.
1	Previous research has found a link between economic development and post-materialist and libertarian values. This research examines social change in values in Japan from the mid-1970s to the beginning of the 21st century. Using Japanese survey data, we investigate the nature and pace of social change during the economic crisis of the early 1990s, as well as in the periods before and after the burst of the bubble economy. We find that social change stalled during the economic crisis and resumed again in the late 1990s, but at a much lower level than in the late 1980s. We argue that economic period effects are largely responsible for the slowdown in social change in values in Japan at the end of the 20th century. 
1	Recent research has conceptualized sustainability as the environmental efficiency of wellbeing (EWEB). This concept takes into account the benefits societies are able to produce from their demands on the environment. Research along these lines indicates that countries vary widely in the efficiency with which they transform the Earth's resources into well-being. Here, we take up this finding as a puzzle to be explained. We construct a new measure of EWEB using the ecological footprint per capita (a measure of environmental consumption) and average life satisfaction (a measure of subjective well-being). We draw hypotheses from political economy, modernization, and sustainable consumption theories in the environmental social sciences. Using full information maximum likelihood estimation, we test the effects of climate, political, economic, and social factors on EWEB with a sample of 105 countries. Key findings include a negative quadratic effect of economic development on EWEB, a negative effect of income inequality, and a positive effect of social capital. 
0	The stress paradigm links stress exposure to deleterious mental health outcomes. However, instruments which operationalize stress exposure have generally focused on micro or individual level stressors. Despite calls for greater attention to macro level stressors since the 1990s, most research has continued to focus on micro level stressors. This paper addresses one type of macro level stressor, involving the events of 9/11/01 and continuing fears of terrorism. We examined: 1)the prevalence of negative political beliefs related to 9/11 and subsequent  fears of terrorism maintained in 2003 and 2)the extent to which these beliefs/fears predicted distress and drinking two years later. Respondents in a longitudinal Midwestern workplace cohort study were surveyed at 6 time points between 1996 and 2005. Instruments assessed: negative beliefs/fears related to 9/11 in 2003, and  a variety of distress and drinking outcomes  in 2005.  Regression analyses demonstrated that negative terrorism-related beliefs and fears maintained in 2003 were predictive of distress and  drinking in 2005, controlling for prior distress and drinking. These data support the utility of broadening the stress paradigm to incorporate the salience of macro level stressors for explaining deleterious mental health outcomes.
0	This paper is a report on a case study at a Midwestern grain handling facility.  Key emergent concepts were danger and safety.  The plant workers have an excellent safety record that I attribute not to formal safety programs, but to the workers opposition to those formal safety programs.  An in-depth analysis of the informal workers relations with their bureaucratic employers and the development of an oppositional culture of safety explain how this came to be.
1	Identity maintenance processes can affect performance when that performance is relevant to an important self-identity, including performance on standardized tests of mental ability. Affect control theory proposes that individuals' performances are motivated to maintain concordance between fundamental sentiments about identities and contextually driven transient meanings. An experimental test used the college major identity and randomly assigned participants to different instruction sets that made an aptitude test either relevant to their major or a contrasting major (All participants took the Raven advanced progressive matrices test.). Participants who took a test of mental ability that they expected would verify their identity scored two and a half points higher than did participants who took a test of mental ability expected to verify a contrasting identity. Results strongly support the fundamental validity of affect control theory's predictions about situational meaning maintenance [Heise, David R., 1979.

1	Using a pooled sample constructed from recent installments of the Displaced Workers Survey, this study examines the racial disparities in postdisplacement outcomes while controlling for the predisplacement experience and earnings of individual workers. It finds no racial difference in the reemployment wage, but there is a large racial disparity in the chances of reemployment among workers with equivalent characteristics and experience. This lower reemployment rate of displaced black workers may be due to individual differences in search behavior, but it is also consistent with contemporary accounts of hiring discrimination.
0	Research has shown that field of education, net of level of education, have consequences later on-- for career paths, labor market success, etc. This study investigates gender and racial/ethnic differentiation in fields of study for bachelors degree and the factors that contribute to such patterning. The classification of fields of study employs two schemes: one is based on hierarchical nature of earnings power and results in a binary outcome of lucrative/non-lucrative fields; the other reflects horizontal dimension of field differences and results in a 4-category outcome: math/physical science/engineering, biology/life science, economics/business, humanity/social science/education. This research draws upon human capital, socialization, and education literature and brings three potential driving forces into focus of analysis: expected labor market attachment, value differences, and previous academic achievement. With data from 1988-2000 National Educational Longitudinal Survey, the preliminary analysis shows that (1) controlling for all the explanatory factors, Afro-Americans are the most likely to major in lucrative fields among the four racial/ethnic groups, and men are two times more likely than women to major in lucrative fields; (2) regarding 4-category outcome, largest gender gap occurs within the field of math/physics/engineering, and gender gap in biology/life sciences remains insignificant, all else being equal; (3) value differences and previous achievement figure prominently in predicting the outcome, while expected labor market attachment does not.
1	Why have African-American private-sector unionization rates surpassed those of white workers for decades, and how has private-sector union decline exacerbated black-white wage inequality? Using data from the Current Population Survey (1973-2007), the authors show that African-Americans join unions for protection against discriminatory treatment in nonunion sectors. A model-predicted wage series also shows that, among women, black-white weekly wage gaps would be between 13% and 30% lower if union representation remained at high levels. The effect of deunionization on racial wage inequality for men is less substantial, but without deunionization, weekly wages for black men would be an estimated $49 higher. The results recast organized labor as an institution vital for its economic inclusion of African-American men and women. This study points to the need to move beyond class-based analyses of union decline to an understanding of the gendered role unions once played in mitigating racial inequality.
1	"This article revives the debate over whether women's upward mobility prospects decline as they climb organizational hierarchies. Although this proposition is a core element of the ""glass ceiling"" metaphor, it has failed to gain strong support in previous research. The article establishes a firm theoretical foundation for expecting an increasing female disadvantage, with an eye toward defining the scope conditions and extending the model to upper-level external hires. The approach is illustrated in an empirical setting that meets the proposed scope conditions: corporate law firms in the United States. Results confirm that in this setting, the female mobility disadvantage is greater at higher organizational levels in the case of internal promotions, but not in the case of external hires."
1	Existing cross-national research on educational attainment does not fully address whether the same level of educational attainment generates the same level of literacy skills in different countries. We analyze literacy skills data for young adults from 19 countries in the 1994-1998 International Adult Literacy Survey and find that in all countries, individuals with a higher level of educational attainment tend to have greater literacy skills. However, there is substantial variation across countries in the size of literacy gaps by levels of educational attainment. In particular, young adults in the United States show the largest literacy gaps. Using two-level hierarchical linear models, we find that cross-national differences in the literacy gap between more- and less-educated individuals are systematically linked to the degree of between-school inequality in school resources (instructional materials, class size, teachers' experience and certification).
1	"This article examines variation in the social position of mixed-race populations by exploiting county-level variation in the degree of occupational differentiation between blacks and mulattoes in the 1880 U. S. census. The role of the mixed-race category as either a ""buffer class"" or a status threat depended on the class composition of whites. Black/mulatto occupational differentiation was greatest where whites had high occupational prestige and thus little to fear from a mulatto group. Furthermore, differentiation increased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively low status and decreased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively high status."
0	Drawing on six years of field research with homeschooling mothers, I show four ways they were accused of maternal deviance for keeping their children out of conventional schools, and I uncover the four justifications they used in response.  On the surface, critics objected to the behavior of homeschooling, however, their specific accusationsand the accounts they engenderedrevealed that it was mothers (alleged) emotions that were at issue.  I conclude by discussing how attention to emotions enhances our theoretical understanding of accounts, as well as how these data begin to map out the emotional complexities in the social construction of good mothering.
1	Have the 2001 terrorist attacks and two wars continued to affect the partisan salience of national security issues in US elections? Was the impact of these issues in 2008 overshadowed by renewed focus on the part of voters to domestic conditions and policy issues? This study addresses these questions using recently-released data from the National Election Studies. Building from scholarship on the partisan politics of national security, we seek to incorporate two competing theoretical perspectives on these issues. We consider the 2008 contest in conjunction with the four elections that preceded it to take into account the impact of recent historical events and evaluate key hypotheses. The analysis offers new findings regarding the over-time pattern of influence of national security conflicts on voter choice. We find evidence for the importance of national security issues in the 2008 election, alongside established sources of voter preferences. Implications for theory and research are discussed in conclusion. 
0	Age at first union is increasing throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa at the same time as couples are not universally waiting for marriage before their first sexual intercourse. While most research on the sequences leading to union formation comes from West Africa, we assess the effect of a premarital first birth on entrance into a first union in an urban area in East Africa: Moshi, Tanzania. The data stem from the 2002-2003 Moshi Infertility Survey. Women who spent less than a year in single motherhood were significantly more likely to enter into a first union than childless women. Women who had been single mothers for five or more years (about two-thirds of women with a premarital birth) were significantly less likely to enter into a first union as women without children. Finally, women with premarital births have higher rates of HIV at survey interview.
0	Global forces such as globalization and neo-liberalism have been making local labor markets more flexible in advanced industrial societies. However, the effect of global forces has not necessarily been ubiquitous in the labor market. This is because global forces affect the labor market via local institutions. New middle class in Japan, which consists of professionals and white-collar workers with college degree, is a good case to study the relationship between global forces and local institutions in the labor market. This is because new middle class in Japan has been protected by the Japanese employment system. If the system becomes weaker thanks to Japan’s increasing exposure to global forces, new middle class becomes less stable. However, it might be the case that the system is not responsive to global forces and, therefore, still keeps protecting the class. Thus it is an empirical question whether new middle class in Japan has recently become less stable. To answer this question, I conducted two analyses using a nationwide survey data: Analysis of intra-generational mobility of new middle class between 1995 and 2005 and analysis of the association between new middle class and regular/non-regular employments. A result of the analyses is that, although new middle class was stable for the decade in terms of intra-generational mobility, non-regular workers increased even within new middle class. This result suggests the importance of the divide between regular and non-regular workers within the same class to advance the study of inequality.
0	Migration researchers know that many types of intermediary are involved in the process of migration and settlement from formal to informal ones. Many studies, however, overlook what kinds of role an intermediary undertakes, aside from a utilitarian point of view. Through a case study of Latino day laborers and nonprofit organizations, the paper argues that the role of intermediary is to reinforce the legitimacy of casual employment of undocumented workers in the U.S. They use the Workers Center as a space to mold undocumented workers to socially desirable subjects. First, they foster a state of governmentality from below (Feurguson and Gupta 2002) among day laborers by using the notion of democracy as a source of power. Then, they proclaim the workers civic citizenship by presenting them to the people in adjacent neighboring communities as a harmless and hard-working group of people who are just waiting for work outside. They also advertise the availability of day laborers in newspapers and at media conferences. Through these activities, what an intermediary actually does is that they erase the shadowy image of hiring undocumented workers, and imbues the public with a new perspective that we are supporting their alternative economic adjustment to the American economy.
1	For decades, scholars have wrestled with the assumption that old age is characterized by social isolation. However there has been no systematic, nationally representative evaluation of this possibility in terms of social network connectedness. In this article, we develop a profile of older adults' social integration with respect to nine dimensions of interpersonal networks and voluntary associations. We use new data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a population-based study of non-institutionalized older Americans ages 57 to 85, conducted in 2005 to 2006 Results suggest that among older adults, age is negatively related to network size, closeness to network members, and number of non-primary-group ties. On the other hand, age is positively related to frequency of socializing with neighbors, religious participation, and volunteering. In addition, age has a U-shaped relationship with volume of contact with network members. These findings are inconsistent with the view that old age has a universal negative influence on social connectedness. Instead, life-course factors have divergent consequences for different forms of social connectedness. Indeed, some later-life transitions, such as retirement and bereavement, may prompt greater connectedness. We conclude by urging increased dialogue between social gerontological and social network research.
0	School effects research is an umbrella concept which shelters numerous questions.  This paper follows and extends a critique of neighborhood effects research and the Moving to Opportunity experiment (Sobel, 2006a, 2006b) and applies it to educational research on school effects.  Using the counterfactual or potential outcomes framework, the paper clarifies the quantities that can be estimated in schools effects research and highlights the implications of the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA).  Many school effects questions in school can be conceived of as either one of two types: student assignment effects or context change effects.  Context change effects can be soundly estimated by analyzing aggregate units of analysis, but identifying student assignment effects is more difficult.  Charter school research serves throughout as an illustrative example.
1	Many theories in the sociology of emotions assume that emotions emerge from the cognitive consistency principle. Congruence among cognitions produces good feelings whereas incongruence produces bad feelings. A work situation is simulated in which managers give feedback to workers that is consistent or inconsistent with what the workers expect to get from their performance. Workers' emotional reactions are then obtained. The power and status of the managers is investigated. The findings reveal that how much time workers have to process their performance feedback, and the power and status of the managers, influence workers to feel good about feedback that is inconsistent with their expectations. These findings are consistent with the enhancement process. We suggest that the enhancement process be included in sociology theories on emotions.
1	Declines in support for the male breadwinner, female homemaker family model in recent decades have been thoroughly documented, but research into the way such attitudes change over the lifecourse remains limited. Drawing on panel data and latent growth curve modeling techniques, the study identifies patterns and predictors of attitude change from 1977 through 1993. Women support for gender specialization in marriage declined rapidly from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s, but this was followed by an interval of stability until the mid-1990s. Education is negatively associated with support for the male breadwinner model, but there was educational convergence in attitudes between the late 1970s and the early 1990s. The results highlight the critical role Of women's employment for explaining the pattern of attitude change across the lifecourse.
0	Women receive mixed messages concerning their appropriate roles with work and family, but the fact that wives often defer to their husbands careers has far-reaching implications for gender inequality in our culture.  Whether women decide to work for pay or not, they need to negotiate household labor and childcare with their husbands.  This project surveyed and interviewed first time expectant mothers regarding factors influencing their decision-making concerning work and family life.  While none of the respondents mentioned negative attitudes about their own mothers working, some communicated negative evaluations of working mothers in general.  Past research suggests that husbands have greater power in the household because their emotional support was the strongest predictor of whether mothers worked or not.  However, current interview results indicate that women actually choose husbands according to whether they will be supportive of their wives wishes on this very important issue.  The interviewees experiences with their own mothers working, their perceived need for income, views of motherhood and job satisfaction also influenced their decisions to work or stay at home.  But despite employment status, these women tended to carry the lions share of domestic duties.
1	"Although law prohibits race-based exclusion in college sororities and fraternities in the United States, racial segregation prevails. As a result, nonwhite membership in white Greek-letter organizations (WGLOs) is often hailed as a transformative step toward equality and unity. The bulk of work on such cross-racial membership centers on comparative-historical and survey data and treats integrated membership as the successful end, rather than a problematic beginning, of analysis. Drawing upon in-depth interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in three university campuses on the East Coast, I shift the focus from resource factors that either prevent or enable membership to the strategies of action that nonwhite members employ in their everyday lives in order to be perceived as full, belonging members. By drawing upon the insights of the sociology of culture, I argue that robust racialized schemas simultaneously enable and constrain inclusion. Rather than hide explicit racial-ethnic difference or accede to traditional expectations of Anglo conformity, I find that nonwhite members are enmeshed in a paradox of participation: their ability to frame themselves as equal and belonging Greek ""brothers and sisters"" remains tied to a patterned reproduction of their racial and ethnic identities as essentially different and inferior. Such a paradox emerges as an important theoretical and pragmatic dilemma with implications for an array of institutional contexts. Keywords: whiteness, identity, schema, segregation, fraternity, sorority."
1	This paper examines the effect of employment-supportive policies and arrangements on women's economic contribution to their family. Using samples of working-age couples in 21 countries we employ multilevel modeling to separate the effects of household and country-level variables on earnings. We distinguish two types of relevant contextual factors: those that support women's employment while preserving their domestic roles and those that potentially reduce intra-family economic inequalities by allowing women to allocate more of their time to paid employment. The findings suggest that all employment-supportive policies and arrangements increase women's relative contribution to the household income through their effect on female labor force participation. Among dual-earner families, however, higher rates of childcare facilities increase women's contribution, while long maternity leave and part-time employment decrease it. These tendencies are more pronounced among mothers. 
1	Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study and the Current Population Survey, we find that labor market conditions play a large role in explaining the positive relationship between educational attainment and marriage. Our results suggest that if low-educated parents enjoyed the same, stronger labor market conditions as their more-educated counterparts, then differences in marriage by education would narrow considerably. Better labor markets are positively related to marriage for fathers at all educational levels. In contrast, better labor markets are positively related to marriage for less-educated mothers but not their more-educated counterparts. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories about women's earning power and marriage, the current economic recession and future studies of differences in family structure across education groups.
1	This paper employs a field experiment to assess whether interpersonal contact changes domiciled individuals' attitudes of the homeless. Volunteers for Project Homeless Connect-a one-day event that provides social services to the homeless-were asked to complete a pre- and post-survey. The results provide mixed support for the contact hypothesis. After volunteering, respondents were far less likely to see homelessness as the result of individual characteristics, such as substance abuse or work aversion. However, opinion was remarkably stable when it came to policy preferences. The results cast doubt on the conventional wisdom that individuals' perceptions of the causes of homelessness track closely with their preferences for governmental policy. 
0	When we present ourselves as doing research that is participatory and action oriented, are we meeting either of those goals?  An analysis of 232 concept applications sent to the Sociological Initiatives Foundation community-based research funding pool shows that most research presented as participatory and action oriented is neither.  Grass roots community members, or organizations controlled by them, are rarely involved at the crucial decision stages of research, and instead limited to participation in collecting data.  In addition, most research was proposed to produce papers, presentations, or websites, rather than directly support action.  The paper provides recommendations for how to move toward research that is more participatory and more integrally connected to action.
1	This article reevaluates traditional racial and gender disparities in the work satisfaction literature by examining the US. military: an institution that has ameliorated many racial inequalities while exacerbating gender conflict. The military departs from civilian society in some analytically useful ways, making it a unique, though underutilized, setting for examining inequality. Using data from the Pentagon 1999 Survey of Active Duty Personnel (SADP), results suggest that black males and females, Latino males and females, and white females all experience greater perceived benefits to military service than do white males along several dimensions of self-assessed job satisfaction and quality of life. Perceptions of advantage relative to civilian reference group comparisons largely explain these findings. I conclude by discussing how the structure of organizations can be powerful enough to reverse differences in relative satisfaction among key status groups.
0	Karl Polanyi’s double movement theory identified environmental degradation as a central problem under free market capitalism, yet environmental sociologists have not yet used Polanyi’s concepts to analyze environmental justice (EJ) movements, missing a rich set of tools.  Simultaneously, Polanyian theory suffers from a dearth of meso-level inquiries testing his theory of countermovements contemporarily.  My neo-Polanyian model, adapted to neoliberal contexts and attending to a meso-level of analysis, displays innovative utility in analyzing EJ movements.  After reviewing EJ literature and Polanyian theory, I present comparative case studies of uranium-related social movements in Monticello, Utah, and Paradox Valley, Colorado.  To illustrate my neo-Polanyian model, I contrast Monticello’s emergent social movement addressing uranium’s negative legacy with a local social movement supporting construction of Piñon Ridge Uranium Mill in Colorado.  I ask: How might we advance Polanyian double movement theory, illuminating patterns across EJ movements?  What conditions lead to various types of environmental countermovements?
1	While social movement scholars have added immeasurably to our knowledge of activist framing, few researchers analyze the circumstances leading to variation in the frames articulated by movement actors. In this study, 1 explore an important and understudied form of frame variation, whether activists use more moderate or more radical frames. Using framing data from the early twentieth-century U.S. women's jury movements, I first show that activists offered both a more traditional and moderate difference frame, arguing that women should be permitted on juries because they would provide a unique female perspective in jury deliberations, and a more radical equality frame, stating that women had an equal right to sit on juries and they were as intellectually capable as men to do so. Second, I demonstrate that a combination of circumstances explains whether the jury activists were likely to articulate more moderate or more radical arguments. I find that frame variation is driven by activist organizational identities, a cultural and political resonance process, and a counterframing process. Findings from multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses reveal that all three processes influenced jury activist framing.
1	Large surveys tend to be strong on reliability and generalizability but weak on validity. The recently collected Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort, a large and representative sample of over 10,000 infants assessed at 9 and 24 months, took a provocative step toward trying to improve the validity of measures of infants' environmental conditions. Instead of relying solely on self-reported surveys, the study design employed two additional data collection methods interviewer observations and a videotaped mother/infant interaction. We assess how much additional and unique information about mothering is gained by having this extra data. The percentage of variation in infants' cognitive development we can explain with mothering behaviors doubles when using a multi-method approach versus relying solely on mothers' self-reports. However, our multi-method model of mothering still only explains about two percent of the variation in infants' cognitive development. 
0	In this paper I measure whether any gender difference in the experience of empathy from ones romantic partner exists, and whether men and womens experience of empathy from their romantic partner affects the stability of their relationship.  Specifically, I use the Fragile Families and Child Well-being data and measure the experience of empathy as report of feeling understood.  I find that there is a significant gender difference in amount of empathy shown (with male partners saying they feel as if they are understood more by their female partners than vice versa) and that empathy from only male partners contributes to relationship stability.
0	This paper contributes to a broader understanding of boundary dynamics by adopting a macro-comparative approach to examining how symbolic boundaries intersect with material practices, and how this intersection relates to the creation or dissolution of institutionalized social boundaries. I analyze data on the 30 most recently initiated cases of insurgency worldwide wherein insurgent forces worked to overthrow a seated government. Using correspondence analysis, I examine the intersecting relationship between established strategies for counter insurgency and these cases, assessing how specific practices correspond to conflict outcomes. A variable accounting for symbolic boundaries of relevance to the conflict is then introduced and used to assess how these boundaries influence the constitution of the social space in relation to the conflict outcomes and the established strategies. This approach allows for the analytic bounding of multiple cases within a single social space, and for the use of inductive case selection to assess the dynamics of symbolic boundaries. Further, by adopting a macro comparative approach to boundaries in social conflict, this analysis provides a more synthetic assessment of the relationship between symbolic and social boundaries than is provided by the case studies and localized research that largely characterizes extant scholarship in this area.
1	"The proportional odds assumption in ordered logit models is a restrictive assumption that is often violated in practice. A violation of the assumption indicates that the effects of one or more independent variables significantly vary across cutpoint equations in the model. In order to relax this assumption for the cumulative odds model, researchers may use either a ""partial"" model that relaxes the assumption for a subset of variables or the ""generalized"" model that relaxes the assumption for every independent variable. In this paper, we propose a relatively new and under-utilized third alternative, the proportional odds with partial proportionality constraints (POPPC) model, which allows the effects of a subset of variables to vary across cutpoint equations by a common factor. We improve upon an earlier formulation of the POPPC model by offering an additional conceptual justification for the model and an estimation method that does not require the use of person-threshold data. We illustrate the POPPC model with two examples from the 2008 General Social Survey. "
0	This paper focuses on the development of the concept of megaphone leadership as a new analytical term used to describe leaders who, from a position of popularity through being salient entertainers, are able to turn their fan base into grassroots activist support. This is demonstrated through the compelling case of  the Grillini. This movement's quick ascendancy into Italy's political arena has much to owe to its leader, Italian comedian Beppe Grillo, especially his blog's success through its use as tool of communication, aggregation and mobilization. The first part of this paper explains the concept of megaphone leadership by placing it within the literature on social movement leadership. In the section that follows, the main characteristics and achievements of the Grillini are outlined. In the last part, the case of the Grillini is used to show the causes for the emergence of this leadership model, the extent of its success, and its main advantages and disadvantages. The final objective is to show how the unique communicative and organizational opportunities provided by celebrity leadership, as exemplified by this case, can have a deep impact on social movement leadership and its capacity for aggregation, organization and communication.
0	Social movement research continues to explore movement efforts to mobilize potential participants. While such scholarly efforts often recognize the importance of collective action frames in motivating participation and action in relation to a social problem, less inquiry has been made regarding the manner in which framing has become an active process of translation and communication on the part of movement actors. This article suggests that within the environmental health movement in the US, activists have adopted the project of reframing and reformulating scientific research in an effort to both attract more participants and influence policy makers. This rendering process in which movement actors translate and reframe complex scientific information is a vital component of movement mobilization and success.
1	Combining statistical and ethnographic analyses, this article explores the prevalence and ramifications of eviction in the lives of the urban poor. A quantitative analysis of administrative and survey data finds that eviction is commonplace in inner-city black neighborhoods and that women from those neighborhoods are evicted at significantly higher rates than men. A qualitative analysis of ethnographic data based on fieldwork among evicted tenants and their landlords reveals multiple mechanisms propelling this discrepancy. In poor black neighborhoods, eviction is to women what incarceration is to men: a typical but severely consequential occurrence contributing to the reproduction of urban poverty.
0	Is faith stronger than bureaucracy? As part of larger transformations in the welfare state, Charitable Choice and other faith-based initiatives target increased participation by religious organizations. These shifts are based on the belief that faith-based organizations are somehow different from traditional social services providers, capable of avoiding the exigencies of bureaucracy. I conceptualize these legislative efforts as exogenous shocks intended to reorganize the social service delivery system. Using ethnographic data, I uncover multiple logics operating in the delivery of social services in one faith-based organization.  The agency is guided by a set of bureaucratic imperatives that structure the formal organization, in this case dictating a move from intensive after-school programming to an in-school mini workshop format.  However, in the implementation of programming, individual actors draw on multiple discursive strategies, including a technocratic logic and a logic of compassion. These findings suggest that faith-based organizations are not acting as spaces of personal transformation or providing social services in new ways based on institutionalized practices thought to inhere in religious organizations.
1	This article analyzes the role in the credit crisis of the processes by which market participants produce knowledge about financial instruments. Employing documentary sources and 87 predominantly oral history interviews, the article presents a historical sociology of the clusters of evaluation practices surrounding ABSs (asset-backed securities, most importantly mortgage-backed securities) and CDOs (collateralized debt obligations). Despite the close structural similarity between ABSs and CDOs, these practices came to differ substantially and became the province (e.g., in the rating agencies) of organizationally separate groups. In consequence, when ABS CDOs 
1	The New Family Structures Study (NFSS) is a social-science data-collection project that fielded a survey to a large, random sample of American young adults (ages 18-39) who were raised in different types of family arrangements. In this debut article of the NFSS, I compare how the young-adult children of a parent who has had a same-sex romantic relationship fare on 40 different social, emotional, and relational outcome variables when compared with six other family-of-origin types. The results reveal numerous, consistent differences, especially between the children of women who have had a lesbian relationship and those with still-married (heterosexual) biological parents. The results are typically robust in multivariate contexts as well, suggesting far greater diversity in lesbian-parent household experiences than convenience-sample studies of lesbian families have revealed. The NFSS proves to be an illuminating, versatile dataset that can assist family scholars in understanding the long reach of family structure and transitions. 
1	Indonesia's Islamic revival has coincided with the growing involvement Of women in civil society. Muslim women's organizations are playing an important role in how the Indonesian nation-state is being re-imagined for the 21(st) century. Muslim women's groups are incubators for women's diverse political activism. The increasing role of Islam in the public sphere provides religious women with an important platform, facilitating their involvement in national debates over issues such as Shariah law, abortion and pornography. Such public sphere debates enfold significant struggles over the relationship between religion and the state. Through their involvement in these debates, Muslim women activists should be seen as participants in the renegotiation of the Indonesian nation-state.
1	Cross-national comparisons of the prevalence of depression in general populations are hampered by the absence of comparable data. Using information on the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms from the third wave of the European Social Survey (ESS-3), we are able to fill this gap. In the ESS-3, depression is measured with an 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression 
1	Data from the New Immigrant Survey are used to study wealth differentials among U.S. legal permanent residents. This study is unique in its ability to account for wealth held in the U.S. and that held abroad and yields several key findings. First, relative to immigrants from Western Europe, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (who have median wealth similar to native born non-Hispanic whites), other immigrant groups have lower levels of total wealth even after accounting for permanent income and life course characteristics. Second, time in the U.S. is positively associated with the wealth of married immigrants, yet this relationship is not statistically significant for single immigrants. Third, differences in the means of measured characteristics between Western European immigrants and those from most other origin regions account for more than 75 percent of observed wealth disparities. However, for immigrants from Asia and from the Indian subcontinent, much of the wealth differential remains unexplained by these factors. 
0	Scholars of homelessness have charted the manner in which local police departments utilize retroactive and proactive code-enforcement practices which predated the 1980s spike in homelessness, but which are discriminately applied to homeless populations to curtail their movements. Some of these scholars have also charted the manner in which the social control efforts of civic institutions, such as Business Improvement Districts and NIMBY groups complement the exclusionary efforts of local police departments. While elucidating, these studies tend to grant analytic priority to collective actors that have an interest in protecting capital investments in urban space. This paper contends that we must also unpack the ways in which urban space mediates the practical activities of the central and the ancillary institutions that are key to homeless peoples survival. We must also pay attention to the ways in which these institutional practices combine with those of the law-and-order state, thereby structuring homeless urbanites practical actions. Such a synthesis holds the promise of elucidating a citys spatial division of labor, revealing how it reproduces the social relations of production. The Lafayette neighborhood, Nashvilles current skid row, is the empirical case through which these processes are analyzed.
1	Using 2005 National Household Education Survey data, this paper compares the effects of child and family characteristics on early childhood education and care use for children of foreign born mothers versus children of native-born mothers. Maternal nativity serves as a proxy for maternal immigration status in an effort to determine if child and family characteristics differentially predict enrollment. We consider relative, non-relative, and center-based care arrangements in two age groups: 0-2 and 3-5 years old. Multivariate analyses reveal that once demographic differences are controlled, patterns of use are mostly similar irrespective of maternal nativity. 
0	How did black Republicans in Darien, Georgia, consistently defeat Democrats at the polls, even after Georgia was redeemed in 1870 and even after Reconstruction was dismantled in 1876?   Secondary sources, including histories and ICPSR data provide support for an interest group theory of partisanship but lack the precision required for an explanation of why Darien was exceptional.  A systematic analysis of Darien and Ridgeville populations, compared to a five percent sample of the U.S. (including Georgia), using data from the Ninth (1870) U.S. Census of Population and Housing, ultimately provides the key to explaining why Darien was peculiar.  In Darien, a black and mulatto middle class had the economic and political resources to take advantage of the short-lived opportunity provided by Radical Republican Party governance in 1870.
0	Although many studies address emotional reactions to injustice, few address how perceptions of distributive injustice mediate between situational conditions and emotional responses.  Moreover, no studies compare how those situational conditions may differentially affect emotional experiences compared to emotional expressions.  Here we examine these issues focusing uniquely on observers perceptions of distributive justice.  Using LISREL analysis, we investigate how group identity, procedural justice, and the legitimation of the authority by group members affect observers perceptions of distributive injustice, which in turn affect their emotional responses.  Hypotheses suggest that procedurally fair treatment and legitimacy decrease the severity of perceived injustice for another, which then attenuates negative emotional experiences.  In contrast, group identity is predicted to heighten the perceived severity of injustice and to spur stronger negative emotional reactions.  Legitimacy and procedural justice, however, may also suppress the expression of felt emotions.  Student study volunteers (N=173) read a vignette describing a distributively unjust situation in a volunteer organization and answered a series of questions.  Preliminary analyses support the logic of the model.  Discussion of results focuses on the implications of the experience and expression of negative emotions for ensuring justice for others.
0	This essay contributes to the emerging scholarship on familialism, gender relations, and welfare states by examining the social policies on reproduction and sexuality that have been imagined and enacted by the three political regimes that have held power in Nicaragua since the 1979 revolution. Policies on contraception, maternal and child health, sex education, abortion, sexual orientation, and sexual violence advanced by the Sandinistas (1979-1990), the Chamorro government (1990-1996), and the Aleman government  (1996-2002) are part of a larger ideological and political landscape of state building and reform in Nicaragua.  I argue that the construct of familialism allows us to observe that the rapid transitions in political regimes and their policies exhibit contradictions in both symbolism and the material consequences of such policies on the sexual and reproductive lives of Nicaraguas gendered citizens.  Familialism not only emanates from the state in an attempt to direct the popular imagination, but also produces a response to the state from the populace. Such practices create opportunities for resistance and collective action, and in the case of Nicaragua, a vibrant, diverse, and strong womens movement.
0	This paper explores the social dimensions of microfinance programs which are credit and savings programs targeted at fostering financial self-sustainability of the poor. Such programs have become the most popular development strategy since the 1990s and microfinance groups are to be found in developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. These groups are rural neighborhood based groups composed almost exclusively of women in most cases. One of the central premises of these programs is that giving credit to women rather than men leads to their empowerment by giving them greater control over household economic resources. However, I find that there are also non-economic ways in which such group membership leads to womens empowerment. In this paper I will use the case study of one such group to demonstrate how social capital gained by the women through such group membership plays a key role in their empowerment. Enhanced social capital in this case finds expression through group based collective action for acquiring public goods. This in turn leads to a positive change in the public perception of womens collective power. This results in a virtuous cycle of a change in womens self-perception of their power which is reflected in greater agency. This calls for a more sociologically informed analysis of such financial programs and more attention to the social dimensions of economic interventions.
0	Current theories in the sociology of emotions posit contradictory expectations regarding the expected relationship between status and the relative experience of anger, with some predicting a negative while others proposing a positive relationship.  Using data from the 1996 GSS emotions module, we investigate the relationship between anger and socioeconomic status.  Connecting different strands of research in the social psychology of emotions and making use of an insight derived from Blaus macrostructural theory, we propose that the relationship between SES and the expression of anger should be non-linear, with SES initially decreasing the expression of anger in accordance with the mechanisms advanced by both cultural and structural-relational models of emotions and later turning positive, as the ecology of encounters of high SES individuals begins to favor anger-eliciting  status-dissimilar interactions.  The results generally support our model:  SES has a U shaped relationship with the expression of anger.  The negative component of the relationship can be accounted for by locus of control and feeling rules mechanisms, while the positive explained by the higher propensity of high SES individuals to have anger eliciting encounters with lower status alters.  We discuss the implications of our findings for existing models of the linkage between stratification and emotional experience.
0	Where do I begin and end? is an ever-present, if sometimes only implicit, question among those with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).  This illness, marked by emotional disregulation, fear of abandonment and PTSD symptoms affects approximately 2% of the population, making it the most prevalent personality disorder in America. Understandably, this means a noteworthy number of children are raised by a parent suffering from BPD. Ultimately, many of these children suffer from varying levels of negative effects. Using a novel method of analyzing entire message board threads from an online support group, grounded theory was used to illuminate the interactional processes taking place among Adult Children with a BPD parent. This group meets online for lack of an offline corollary. Themes that emerged explained three types of identity management processes taking place in the community: individual, group-level, and inter-group. Findings suggest the question of where do I begin and end? translates inter-generationally to these children. And it becomes more than an issue of boundaries: with no socially recognized identity outside of this group setting, and a history of being absorbed by a parent, this is a question of boundary maintenance in service of a larger question: do I exist at all? Recommendations for treatment and clinical interventions are discussed.
0	We examine some certain conditions under which status generalization processes can be modeled as types of a mathemetical game.  In most conditions studied so far, status characterisatics theory (SCT) can be used as a solution algorithm to explain or predict the way the process ( and the group) becomes organized in a coordination game.  In slightly different conditions, somewhat different game models appear more accurate (e.g., an assurance game).  As one result, the old definition of cooperative games, based on Nash's work, appears as a partial definition; there are game-like conditions which are fundamentally cooperative without requiring, say, binding agreements or bargaining.  Yet interactions among players' strategies and moves lead either to favorable or unfavorable payoffs.  As there are different types of these games, there are different kinds of status generalization, and important modifications need to be made in SCT.  Use of game theory models may be a real strategic advance, practically and theoretically, with more elegant and potent uses of mathemetics.  Finally, considering game models for network exchange theory (NET) and for SCT, scientists may get deeper, more disciplined understanding of the relations among different kinds of power and of status relations.
0	Contrary to initial media reports following Hurricane Katrina, the crime rate in the city of New Orleans in Katrinas aftermath was actually significantly lower than in the months before the storm. Using a social constructionist perspective and drawing on print media coverage of the storm, this article analyzes the role the media played in the social construction of lawlessness in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. Content analysis of 193 articles published in major papers between September 29, 2005 and August 4, 2005 show a developing narrative that gradually changes and  sets the stage for the widespread horrific (and false) reports of murder, rape, and anarchy that appear in later weeks. Particular attention is given to the shifting meaning of looting which changes drastically in the week immediately following the storm. The consequences of the medias coverage are discussed as it relates to legal consciousness as well as public policy.
0	Increasingly within organizational theory the role of the state has gained attention as a source of influence on organizational change.   This analysis proposes a model where the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, as a derivative of state power, served as a shifting mechanism that realigned the institutional network in which corporate governance was embedded through a series of macroeconomic policy initiatives that began in late 1979.  We propose that a new monetary logic of action for governance emerged during the 1980s as a result of unique and historically specific circumstances that, when coupled with an increasing commodification of the corporation, was characterized by a greater tendency for opportunism and self interest on the part of management.  In conclusion this model examines the link between a monetary logic of corporate governance and an increasing incidence of corporate crime over the past two decades and proposes that this logic was a significant force behind the institutionalization of organizational deviance as a solution for managing new environmental contingencies.
1	This article uses updated purchasing power parity measurements of countries' income and a new strategy for approximating global inequality to examine how global income inequality-as a combination of increasing average within-country inequality and decreasing between-country inequality-changed in the period 1980-2005. In view of the overwhelming influence of China and India on trends in global inequality change, the authors base their strategy on estimating the change in world average within-country inequality from change in within-country inequality of these two countries. The authors find that global inequality decreased continuously throughout the period. They also project that global inequality will likely rise again in the next 25 years unless the stellar economic performance of China and India spreads widely to other developing countries.
0	Internet optimists and evangelists laud the Internets power to extend knowledge (and opinion) globally, but how does the Internet influence the knowledge it unleashes?  And is the promise of expanding knowledge the same for individuals and for society or are the two possibilities exclusive?  I argue that the relationship between individual search and collaborative practices and their combination into global patterns holds the key to an essential irony: As the Internet broadens individual knowledge horizons it reduces the global pool of knowledge.  I demonstrate this the case of global science and scholarship using a database of 34 million articles, their citations (1945 to 2005), and online availability (1998 to 2005).  Even as the Internet influences scientists and scholars to become more interdisciplinary and cosmopolitan, they converge to the same divergent hubs of research, which narrows the global span of knowledge considered in the next generation.
1	As the recent economic crisis has demonstrated, inequality often spans credit and labor markets, supporting a system of cumulative disadvantage. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this research draws on stigma, cumulative disadvantage and status characteristics theories to examine whether credit and labor markets intersect through the event of bankruptcy to disadvantage certain individuals over time. The transmission of bankruptcy's stigma across markets occurs in a specific legal setting where, even though the current U.S. Bankruptcy Code grants bankrupters a fresh start through debt forgiveness, the Fair Credit Reporting Act limits bankrupters' ability to begin anew because it permits employers to access credit reports. My findings highlight these ambiguities and show that, net of their previous labor market statuses, bankrupters spend less time working and have lower earnings than nonbankrupters. Thus, having become bankrupt exposes people to subsequent disadvantage in the labor market.
0	When statistical expertise is offered in a litigation context, the result can be bad law and bad statistics.  In this paper, I analyze how statistical evidence is used in the class certification phase of employment discrimination litigation.  I analyze how the institutional context of litigation determines how statistical evidence is presented by plaintiffs and defendants and evaluated by the courts.  I show that under current case law, defendants can and do introduce statistical evidence that has absolutely no relevance on the issue before the Court, yet is often persuasive in defeating class certification.  I then show how both weak and strong statistical power is exploited by experts on each sides of the litigation. Finally I outline a new approach for framing issues of statistical inference and hypothesis testing in a way that more effectively addresses the issue of whether or not systematic bias exists throughout an organization.
0	Social Capital is resources embedded in social networks. Its positive association with health is established, but whether its health effect varies with age is unexplored. This study integrates two research paradigms in the health literature: social capital theory and the cumulative advantage perspective, and examines whether the effects of social capital on depression and self-reported health are contingent on age. I use unique data from the Taiwan Social Change Survey collected in 1997, and measure social capital through the position generator. Results show that the negative effect of social capital on depression increases with age, and indicate that social capital exerts a stronger protective effect on mental health for the older respondents than for the younger respondents. Results also show that the positive effect of social capital on self-reported health does not vary with age. These findings contribute to a more complete picture of whether and how social capital interacts with age to shape the social pattern of different health outcomes.
0	This study aims to understand womens experience in the male-dominated profession. Female doctors in this profession suffer from direct or indirect discrimination in Taiwan. In-depth interviews indicate that female doctors have encountered discrimination and prejudice at various stages of their careers. These interviews also indicate that male and female doctors are in different social positions in the medical profession. Many subtle mechanisms, such as gendered selection of specialty at early stages of their careers, seem to enhance male doctors position in this profession. In addition, gendered organizational structure and social processes are constructed to maintain submission of female doctors. Female doctors make every effort to strike a balance between work and family, which constitutes long-term pressure that is detrimental to their professional status. Female doctors were consequently unable to shatter the glass ceiling of the profession dominated by men.
0	Using a combination of Census microdata and qualitative in-depth interview and time diary data from 20 stay-at-home and 10 working fathers, this paper seeks to answer three distinct questions: (1) Do stay-at-home fathers see housework as part of their job description, or do they still expect their wives to complete these daily tasks even while staying home full-time?, (2) Does becoming a stay-at-home father translate into a permanent identity for men, or alternatively, is it a temporary, economic-based solution families resort to when attempting to balance work and childcare?, and (3) Do stay-at-home fathers drop out of the labor force completely, or do many of them still complete part-time or free lance work, pursue future career goals, and/or make plan to reenter the labor force while staying home? In answering these three questions, I aim to better understand what factors drive this emergent group of men to become primary caregivers, how they spend their time while staying home, and what identifying oneself as a full-time father actually means, thereby improving our understanding and measurement of new forms of family life.
0	With nursing homes as a focus, this paper proposes that rituals are an important part of social life for employees in organizations.  Using 40 biographies, autobiographies, and research monographs to examine nursing homes, this study reviews various symbolic themes expressed through daily work rituals.  The themes involve concepts related to bureaucracy.  They include staff separation, rules, documentation, efficiency, and meetings.  Utilizing the theory of structural ritualization, we suggest that certain ritualized symbolic practices expressing these themes extensively influence nursing home exployees.  They shape their cognitions, patterns of behavior, and social interaction.  They also lead to the unintended maltreatment of residents.  The findings of this study contribute to research on structural ritualization.  They also indicate problems in nursing homes may apply to existing literature exploring organizational deviance.
0	The context of family formation has changed quite dramatically in recent years. This paper considers how the rise of remarriage and the increasing prevalence of premarital cohabitation affect the trends and patterns of educational homogamy in Britain, using data from the General Household Surveys which cover a thirty year period.
0	One of the aims of this paper is to encourage us to think critically about the distinctive character of the early tradition of American sociological thought. European thinkers were preoccupied with the prospects of the liberation of the individual subsumed under modern institutional constraints. The authors of the early American sociological tradition emphasize the primacy of societal forces over individual freedom in directing changes they observe in society. In this paper I examine how the authors of the early American tradition question to what extent people are free to make their own moral choices under the constraints of acting according to laws of the common good, and to what extent modern institutions encompass the possibility of expressive freedom and development of individual autonomy.
0	An abiding dilemma of participant observation has been how to gain access to subjects’ “inner lives” while maintaining analytic detachment. This article provides a new perspective on this problem, drawing inspiration from the Marquis de Custine’s Russia in 1839, still celebrated for the accuracy of its predictions. Yet Custine was a nineteenth century travel writer whose observational practice was, by modern standards, far from exemplary. His perspicacity therefore presents a puzzle. Here I argue that Custine’s use of his emotions is the key to understanding his percipience. Custine documents a process of “emotional contagion,” through which his thoughts and behavior were influenced by the emotions of those around him. Using the Custine case, I argue that sociologists can harness the potential of emotional contagion by adapting the psychoanalytic use of countertransference, which constitutes a specialized means of working with this ubiquitous feature of human interaction.
1	Why do certain domains of knowledge grow fast while others grow slowly or stagnate? Two distinct theoretical arguments hold that knowledge growth is enhanced by knowledge specialization and knowledge brokerage. Based on the notion of recombinant knowledge growth, we show that Specialization and brokerage arc opposing modes of knowledge generation, the difference between them lying in the extent to which homogeneous vs. heterogeneous input ideas get creatively recombined. Accordingly, we investigate how both modes of knowledge generation can enhance the growth of technology domains. To address this question, we develop an argument that reconciles both specialization and brokerage into a dynamic explanation. Our contention is that specializing in art increasingly homogeneous set of input ideas is both more efficient and less risky than brokering knowledge. Nevertheless, specializing implies progressively exhausting available recombinant possibilities, while brokerage creates new ones. Hence, technology domains tend to grow faster when they specialize, but the more specialized they become, the more they need knowledge brokerage to grow. We cast Out: Our argument into five hypotheses that predict how growth rates vary across technology domains.
1	During the past 50 years, a consensus has been forming around Edward Westermarck's idea that incest avoidance results from an aversion that develops when individuals are brought up in propinquity. The argument here presented counters this emerging consensus. Reexamining the case of the Israeli kibbutzim, the authors show that individuals who grew up in the kibbutzim's communal education system were in fact often attracted to their peers, and only rarely did they develop sexual aversion toward these peers. This article offers an alternative explanation to the problem of incest avoidance and the incest taboo, one that brings sociological factors back into the picture.
0	This article shows the impact of immigrant generation on students’ performance in college calculus courses and examines the extent to which the observed patterns corroborate or contradict various assimilation theories.  It goes beyond past studies of the relationship between immigrant generation and mathematics achievement that focused primarily on middle and high school students and typically excluded the first generation.  We found that first-generation students earned the highest grades, on average, even after controlling for race/ethnicity and SES.  Our findings provide partial support for the immigrant advantage theory.
1	Theorists argue that service economies have relatively high inequality because dichotomies have developed between manufacturing and service industries, and between knowledge-intensive and labor-intensive service industries. Researchers, however, have not adequately tested hypotheses arising from this theory. We overcome this weakness by examining, hierarchically, the effects of service industry employment and the size of Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE) industries on individuals' income in metropolitan statistical areas. Using the 2002 Current Population Survey, we find that dichotomies exist among industries in the service economy that help generate high incomes among upper-echelon occupations, particularly in the knowledge-intensive services and manufacturing industries. These incomes, however, are not available to laborers and service workers. Furthermore, we find that FIRE industry size impacts the wages of managers and service workers in more complicated ways than previously theorized. These findings help clarify the contours of stratification in the contemporary service-oriented economy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	Based on more than 14 months' ethnographic research in China, this article brings in culture and symbolic interactionism to understand the social embeddedness of economic transactions. First, an analytic frame linking tie strengths to defining principles, relational properties, and interactions is constructed and applied to changes in life insurance transactions in China. The data suggest that strong tie transactions were common until the economic gains of the sellers were made public. The author argues that the ethical-affective principle that defines strong ties and the high intensity of trust, affection, and asymmetric obligation that constitute these ties make them a double-edged sword for economic transactions. Instead, ties with midrange or weak strength are more effective because of their relational complementarity (although direct economic exchanges may take place among strong ties under extreme institutional or contingency conditions). The author also reveals that dramaturgical interactions, through which economic actors exercise their agency, are an integral part of embedded transactions.
0	This study examines trends in public opinion toward the war in Iraq among service members from all four military branches using data from the 2004 Military Times Poll.  Overall, most service members report that they believe that the U.S. should have gone to war in Iraq and approve of the presidents handling of Iraq.  Much like trends among civilian samples, men, Republicans, and Caucasians are much more supportive of the war than women, Democrats, and African-Americans.  Additional analysis shows that Marines are the most supportive of the war, controlling for gender, race, and education.  This research suggests that service members follow similar trends as the American public more generally.  However, support for the war may be stronger in the military because of the overrepresentation of men and Republicans in the services.
0	Basing health insurance on the economic productive value of human beings, on a career job, or on having a partner with insurance are disadvantages for women with lower career opportunities. Although employment-based health insurance has become recognized as a factor relevant to remaining in the labor force, the dynamics surrounding gender differences are not well-examined by the large body of mostly economic insurance-retirement research which mainly works from the rational-choice angle. Other fields including sociology and life course literature have only very inconsistently included health insurance when looking at labor force patterns.  None of these studies has examined and theorized gender to the extent that it could fully explain complex gendered labor force patterns which are likely to be exacerbated by employment-based health insurance in the United States.  A sufficient account for gender can only be accomplished when taking marital status and health insurance combined into account, looking at married/divorced/widowed women and men with insurance separately, and in placing much emphasis on spousal insurance and individual income. This paper theorizes for the first time gender in this particular strand of research which largely did not differentiate gendered labor force patterns. This paper is theoretically informed by the doctrine of separate spheres including breadwinning, organizational power structural theories, gender and the life course perspective, and the gender and the social constructionist perspective.
1	Child obesity is a public health priority with numerous and complex causes. This study focuses on factors within the family, namely stressful experiences, which may be associated with child obesity. We examine data from the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for children in two age groups: 5-11 and 12-17 years old. Results from an ordered probit regression model of child weight categorizations (healthy weight, overweight, obese) indicate positive associations between a range of family stressors (lack of cognitive stimulation and emotional support in the household among younger children, and mental and physical health problems and financial strain in the household among older children) and child overweight and obesity. We discuss how public policies that reduce family stressors may, in turn, help reduce child obesity. 
1	With reference to the extensively reported gender differences in estimated intelligence, we used a cross-cultural study to investigate whether employment status and education of mothers and fathers (at the time of data collection, in early childhood, and in later childhood) influenced the estimation of parents' general intelligence. Data showed that mothers' as well as fathers' general intelligence was significantly predicted by their education and current employment status. We additionally found a similar relationship between women's (men's) and mothers' (fathers') intelligence compared with the relationship of intelligence ascribed to their fathers (mothers). Furthermore, women's self-estimated intelligence was significantly predicted by their mothers' current employment, whereas men's self-estimated intelligence was predicted by their fathers' education. We furthermore investigated how women's and men's estimations differ between Germany and Spain. Results indicate that the more pronounced gender segregation in Spain was not expressed in larger gender differences in self- or parents' intelligence estimations. 
0	In this paper we use labor market data on respondents from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) from 1979-2000 to study the role that occupational careers play in social mobility.   A key contribution of our paper is a method to identify careers in longitudinal work history data.  We use matched data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to construct a large number of 1-year panels, and we use this data to identify occupations that are linked by systematic patterns of mobility.  We apply the results on linked occupations from the CPS to the work history data from the NLSY to calculate career tenure, and we estimate the effect of accumulated occupational and career tenure on wage growth.
0	This paper looks at the race, class, and gendered politics of prenatal care access for low-income Latina and Asian immigrant women during a recent historic moment of dramatic federal and state policy changes regarding welfare, immigration, and health care.  I argue that debates regarding who should have access to public services such as prenatal care are important venues from which to understand the shifting boundaries of belonging, entitlement, and participation of immigrants in U.S. society.
1	Networks are well understood as crucial to the diffusion of HIV among injection drug users (IDUs), but quasi-anonymous risk nodes - such as shooting galleries - resist measurement and incorporation into empirical analyses of disease diffusion. Drawing on network data from 767 IDUs in Bushwick, Brooklyn, we illustrate the use of calibrated agent-based models 
1	The authors integrate social movement outcomes research and the world society approach to build a theoretical model to examine the impact of global and local factors on movement outcomes. Challenging the current research on policy change, which rarely examines the effects of global norms and local activism in one analysis, they argue (1) that global regimes empower and embolden local social movements and increase pressure on target governments from below, and (2) that local activists appeal to international forums with help from international activists to pressure the governments from above. When the pressures from the top and the bottom converge, social movements are more likely to succeed. Furthermore, these pressures are stronger in countries integrated into global society and on issues with strong global norms. The empirical analysis of social movements by resident Koreans in Japan advocating for four types of human rights - civil, political, social/economic, and cultural - demonstrates that the movements produced more successes as Japan's involvement in the international human rights regime expanded since the late 1970s, and that activism on issues with strong global norms achieved greater successes. The analysis also shows that lack of cohesive domestic activism can undercut the chances of social movements' success even with strong global norms on the issue.
1	Names often indicate belonging to a certain ethnic group. When immigrant parents choose a first name for their child that is common in their host society, they show a high degree of acculturation. In contrast, selecting a name common only in the parents' country of origin indicates ethnic maintenance. Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel for Turkish, Southwest European, and former Yugoslav immigrants, the authors show that acculturation in terms of name giving depends on several factors: the cultural boundary between the country of origin and the host society, the parents' sociostructural integration in terms of education and citizenship, interethnic networks, and religious affiliation.
1	China's post-1978 economic reform has led to fundamental changes in its urban life. Yet little attention has been paid to the effects of this massive societal transformation on individuals' psychological well-being. Using survey data collected from a national sample of 3,443 Chinese urban residents in 2005, I examine the effects of employment conditions, political affiliation, and regional level of marketization on self-reported symptoms of psychological distress. The findings show that individuals whose personal conditions expose them more to the risks and uncertainty brought about by market reform, such as self-employed workers, are more likely to suffer from psychological distress. By contrast, residents in more marketized areas tend to feel more satisfied with their economic conditions and therefore have lower levels of distress. Taken together, these results suggest that the reduced social protection resulting from reform contributes to an elevated level of psychological distress. However, a higher perceived level of economic well-being reduces distress and partly compensates for the disruptive effects of China's market transition.
0	Social scientists, international aid organizations, governments, and religious groups have conducted extensive research concerning the effectiveness of long-term humanitarian aid.  However, there is little research concerning the effectiveness of short-term humanitarian aid.  This project is centered on the short-term trips that are sent to Cameroon by a small, U.S. based nonprofit that supports an orphanage in Northwest Cameroon.  The purpose of this research project was to identify the issues involved in evaluating short-term humanitarian aid including defining effectiveness, determining unmet needs for evaluation, and exploring the benefits and drawbacks of implementing more formal evaluation methods.  The results of a qualitative analysis of the data revealed that both the orphanage and organization are aware of dependency and dominance issues, but there is a mutual understanding of the benefits of having a dominant organization work with the orphanage toward goals of independence.  Delivering deep and long-lasting happiness and offering long-term support is an important part of short-term trip effectiveness.  Structured goals and the willingness to honestly evaluate short-term trips will enable better evaluation, and the tools used in evaluation must address not only tangible effects but also intangible effects such as improved morale or spiritual development.  This project serves as a starting point for future research by identifying some of the key issues and questions involved in evaluating the effectiveness of short-term humanitarian aid.
0	The rise and expansion of the UNESCO Associated Schools project - with its emphasis on world community, human rights, and international understanding - is a novel development we address from the perspective of the sociology of education and nation-building literature. This paper describes the emergence and expansion of these UNESCO Schools across the world.  Next, through an event history analysis, we estimate the influence of national, regional, and world characteristics as well as linkages to world culture on the likelihood of a country adopting a UNESCO School.  We find that adoption rates are positively influenced by stronger links, by world and regional adoption densities, and by international organizational density. We also find that more developed, more democratic, and more educated countries are not more likely to adopt UNESCO Schools. The implications of these findings are discussed with a view to refining the sociology of education and nation-building literature.
1	Sociologists widely acknowledge that uncertainty matters for decision making, but they rarely measure it directly. In this article, we demonstrate the importance of theorizing about, measuring, and analyzing uncertainty as experienced by individuals. We adapt a novel probabilistic solicitation technique to measure personal uncertainty about HIV status in a high HIV prevalence area of southern Malawi. Using data from 2,000 young adults (ages 15 to 25 years), we demonstrate that uncertainty about HIV status is widespread and that it expands as young adults assess their proximate and distant futures. In conceptualizing HIV status as something more than sero-status itself, we gain insight into how what individuals know they don't know influences their lives. Young people who are uncertain about their HIV status express desires to accelerate their childbearing relative to their counterparts who are certain they are uninfected. Our approach and findings show that personal uncertainty is a measurable and meaningful phenomenon that can illuminate much about individuals' aspirations and behaviors.
1	Compared to other ethnic and racial groups, Hispanic youth are worse off in every available measure of educational achievement and attainment at the primary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Using data from the Texas Higher Education Opportunity Project, we explore the degree to which students' preferences to stay home for college can help explain the low college application rates of Hispanic students. Among high school seniors, we find that (1) Hispanics are the most likely to report it is important to live at home during college, even those with college-educated parents; (2) net of other factors, students who indicate it is important to stay home are significantly less likely to apply to college, especially to selective institutions; and (3) taking account of the preference to stay home significantly reduces the Hispanic-white gap in applying to any college and a four-year college, and it makes the gap in applying to a selective college disappear.
0	This study offers a Bourdieuian analysis of how-to-listen texts for the classical music field in the post-war era. With a focus on the realm of circulation, and the mediation of cultural critics between production and consumption, I focus on how the agents of consecration constructed their listening audience, articulated the classificatory schemes of the field, and encouraged the newly suburban middle class to adopt listening practices worthy of the Protestant leisure ethic. This paper finds that Bourdieu's thesis on French class and culture does have its analog in the same era on American shores.
1	This article analyzes the determinants of innovation and success of innovation in the field of U.S. symphony orchestras from 1879 through 1959: why did major orchestras (N = 27) innovate by introducing works of new composers to the repertoire instead of sticking to canonical pieces? Can organizational processes account for the selection and the popularization of new composers in the repertoire? By integrating field theory and organizational theory, this analysis shows that orchestra and musical director consecration and local elite cohesiveness favored innovative programming. Composers introduced by consecrated actors and entering the repertoire at a time of low competition with established composers and high field-level innovation were more likely to survive in the repertoire and have their works performed frequently. These effects became magnified throughout composers' careers.
0	Explanations of urban violence have remained relatively unchanged for decades. A core argument has been that in neighborhoods confronting multiple political, racial, and economic dislocations, boys and young men will sometimes use violence to attain the opportunities denied to them within conventional society. To date, there are at least two missing explanations within the community distress and violence literature. First, most accounts of violence among boys and men fail to address how colonial histories contribute to community dislocation and male violence. Second, the community distress and violence literature also tends to ignore how violence is a response to racial systems of control. Relying on data from a six-year ethnographic study of youth violence among Pacific Islander adolescents in Hawai’i , I offer a perspective that highlights how racial systems of control were deployed during colonialism and how boys’ violence in the colonial context of Hawai’i  was often an attempt to reclaim the honor and respect that is denied to indigenous Pacific peoples.
1	Immigrant citizenship rights in the nation-state reference both theories of cross-national convergence and the resilience of national political processes. This article investigates European countries' attribution of rights to immigrants: Have these rights become more inclusive and more similar across countries? Are they affected by EU membership, the role of the judiciary, the party in power, the size of the immigrant electorate, or pressure exerted by anti-immigrant parties? Original data on 10 European countries, 1980-2008, reveal no evidence for cross-national convergence. Rights tended to become more inclusive until 2002, but stagnated afterward. Electoral changes drive these trends: growth of the immigrant electorate led to expansion, but countermobilization by right-wing parties slowed or reversed liberalizations. These electoral mechanisms are in turn shaped by long-standing policy traditions, leading to strong path dependence and the reproduction of preexisting cross-national differences.
1	"Are partnerships that begin as ""hookups,"" ""friends with benefits,"" or casual dating relationships less satisfying and rewarding than serious sexual involvements? This research tests whether selection, experience, or mediation processes affect associations between types of sexual involvement and relationship quality. Drawing on a sample of 642 urban adults, we estimated ordinary least squares and treatment-effects regressions examining associations among types of sexual involvement, joint investments, and relationship quality. The results indicated that sexual involvements in nonromantic and casual dating contexts were associated with lower relationship quality in comparison to serious contexts, but these effects were completely accounted for by selectivity. Controlling for joint investments did not mediate these selection effects. The findings support the notion that screening processes associated with sexual involvement have important implications for later relationship quality. "
0	Far right political party support in Western Europe has been primarily examined in terms of the male members who constitute the majority of party members.  However, women make up a not insignificant portion of the parties that has yet to be explained.  What little previous research exists has been qualitative in nature and argues that women vote due to their interest in family values and out of a fear of violence.  Male voters, however, are argued to be voting out of an economic self-interest, that is fueled by anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric.  This paper assesses differences in what brings men and women to vote for the far right in eight European countries using the 1990 World Values Survey.  Results indicate that men and women may have slight differences in what leads them to vote for the far right, but that previous research does not adequately address women in particular.
1	Is the homogenous grouping of students by ability conducive to learning for all students alike, or does it affect students of different ability levels differently? To address this question, I compare the distributions of math performance for students between Grade 8 and Grade 4 across countries with different levels of between-classroom ability grouping, controlling for country-level unobserved heterogeneity using a fixed-effects model. Homogeneous grouping, relative to heterogeneous grouping, is found to have no significant impact on mean performance, but it does increase performance inequality by benefiting the high achievers at the expense of the low achievers. 
0	Scholarly inquiry in social, collective, and public memory has fostered a host of innovative questions, perspectives, and interpretations about how individuals and communities are both constituted by the past and mobilize it for present-day projects.  Yet surprisingly little research in this tradition has empirically confronted its motivating premise, namely that the remembered past does in fact shape peoples attitudes and actions.  For no issue in this nation is the presence of the past more tormenting and sorrowful or seen with greater force than that of race, so the role memories of racial oppression, racial conflict, and racial reconstruction play in framing current race relations and racial sentiments would seem a critical area of scrutiny.  However, it is undeservedly ignored in the extensive and otherwise quite valuable research on racial attitudes.  In this paper, I use the 1993 General Social Survey to address these silences in both the collective memory and race relations literatures by examining how Americans recollections of the civil rights movement influence racial tolerance, stereotypes, norms, and policy preferences.  I find that respondents who spontaneously recalled the civil rights struggle and its victories as an especially important event held clearer, firmer opinions about race (and thereby their willingness to report them) and expressed generally racially liberal (or at least less conservative) attitudes.  My findings thus both support the basic presupposition of collective memory studiesmemory matters--and points to a fruitful innovation in the study of racial attitudes.
0	"This paper uses longitudinal data from ""Marital Instability over the Life Course: A Six-Wave Panel Study, 1980, 1983, 1988, 1992, 1997, and 2000"" to examine the relationships between marital status, duration in current marital state, and marital transitions and psychological well-being.  This study uses a life course approach and argues that taking duration in current status and lifetime marital transitions into consideration can moderate the commonly observed relationship between marital status and psychological well-being."
1	Some sociologists have recently argued that a major aim of sociological inquiry is to identify the mechanisms by which cause and effect relationships in the social world come about. This article argues that existing accounts of social mechanisms are problematic because they rest on either inadequately developed or questionable understandings of social action. Building on an insight increasingly common among sociological theorists-that action should be conceptualized in terms of social practices-I mobilize ideas from the tradition of classical American pragmatism to develop a more adequate theory of mechanisms. I identify three kinds of analytical problems the theory is especially well poised to address and then lay out an agenda for future research.
0	Based on church-sect theory, this article documents midwiferys status as an established sect in relation to its church equivalent: modern medicine. We find that midwifery can endure as an established sect  in other words, as both protest movement and established institution - because of its ability to maintain its central oppositional values while being accepted as a legitimate, if marginalized, profession. Using interview data from twenty-five Florida midwives, we draw an analogy between the liminal status of midwifery and three of the most important characteristics of the established sect: minimal institutionalization, acceptance and opposition, and a unique value set. This comparison shed lights on both church-sect theory and midwifery, which also leads us to suggest that similar analogies be used for analysis across other sub-fields in sociology.
1	"Using geo-referenced data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, in conjunction with decennial census data, this research examines metropolitan-area variation in the ability of residentially mobile blacks, Hispanics, and whites to convert their income into two types of neighborhood outcomes neighborhood racial composition and neighborhood socioeconomic status. For destination tract racial composition, we find strong and near-universal support for the ""weak version"" of place stratification theory; relative to whites, the effect of individual income on the percent of the destination tract population that is non-Hispanic while is stronger for blacks and Hispanics, but even the highest earning minority group members move to tracts that are ""less white"" than the tracts that the highest-earning whites move to. In contrast, for moves into neighborhoods characterized by higher levels of average family income, we find substantial heterogeneity across metropolitan areas in minorities' capacity to convert income into neighborhood quality. A slight majority of metropolitan areas evince support for the ""strong version"" of place stratification theory, in which blacks and Hispanics are less able than whites to convert income into neighborhood socioeconomic status. However, a nontrivial number of metropolitan areas also evince support for spatial assimilation theory, where the highest-earning minorities achieve neighborhood parity with the highest-earning whites. Several metropolitan-area characteristics, including residential segregation, racial and ethnic composition, immigrant population size, poverty rates, and municipal fragmentation, emerge as significant predictors of minority-white differences in neighborhood attainment."
1	Sociologists have long recognized that historical events, such as wars, depressions, and natural disasters, influence trajectories of people's lives and reproduce or alter social structures. This article extends that line of research. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I test three accounts regarding how combat exposure in war affects men's ability to work. The direct cumulative disadvantage account posits that war negatively affects servicemen who see combat, regardless of their pre-combat characteristics. The moderated cumulative disadvantage account suggests that combat most negatively affects men who had lower status before they fought. The turning point account suggests the reverse: combat most negatively affects men who had greater status before they fought. Findings suggest that with regard to disability and unemployment, the effects of combat exposure in war are most consistent with the direct cumulative disadvantage account.
1	Considering long-distance advocacy as a distinctive institution of European modernity, the article examines the genesis and history of networks engaged in political action on behalf of distant others. Ever since the beginnings of European expansion overseas in the sixteenth century, such networks have originated from a persistent pattern of radicalization of religious actors against rival networks within the context of empire. In the late eighteenth century, the very same processes led to the establishment of modern forms of long-distance advocacy, with the international movement against colonial slavery and the slave trade. Throughout, long-distance advocacy was initiated and carried out by distinctively reformist and activist religious organizations within Catholicism and Protestantism. These findings highlight the importance of religious organizations in the imperial context for the configuration of modern forms of political activism.
0	From 1996-2001 the National Opinion Research Center carried out a series of national RDD surveys known as the National Gun Policy Surveys. This paper analyzes these studies and discusses the following points: 1) level of support for several dozen gun control and gun safety policies, 2) use of and exposure to guns, 3) impact of Columbine and other school shootings on gun control attitudes, 4) impact of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 on gun sales and attitudes towards gun control, and 5) predictors of gun control attitudes, including gun use and exposure variables.
0	The purpose of this paper is to establish the distinctiveness of contemporary immigrant integration in rural communities.  The combined characteristics of immigrants and rural communities lead to the exclusion of immigrants from access to public goods and markets for certain goods leaving them reliant on informal and contingent sources of employment, housing, and the full range of needed goods and services.  Consequently, the immigrant experience in rural America is likely to be more diverse and variable than that in urban ethnic enclaves.  For this reason the sociology of rural immigrant integration must emphasize context specificity.  The paper begins with an overview of contemporary immigration trends and then goes on to examine the distinctiveness of immigration to rural America.  We elaborate a conceptual frame to guide research on the integration of immigrants into the social and economic life of rural communities.
0	Increasingly, immigrants to the U.S. have immediate or extended family members residing not only in different households, but also in several different nations, as well as their country of origin.  The processes involved in maintaining international family relations occurs to a greater or lesser extent in all immigrant families, regardless of their national origin or their settlement location.  Yet, within international migration literature the transnational family has been until recently overlooked.  This paper explores an aspect of transnational kinship relations, financial and non-financial exchanges between immigrants and their families abroad.  Specifically, this paper focuses on the impact of gender on the frequency of contact and family reciprocity between immigrant family members in the U.S. and their kin residing outside of the country.  Data was gathered from life-history interviews centering on migration experiences, settlement, and goals or family plans of social mobility.  Findings suggest that reciprocity or exchanges within the family vary by gender, length of stay in host nation, situation of parents in country of origin.  Additionally, this study reveals a relatively unreported aspect of immigrant exchanges; immigrants indicate that they received finical assistance or get help from family members residing abroad during the years directly following migration and later after the immigrants have become settled and established give help to relatives.
1	According to the national Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), between 10% and 90% of women in poorer countries agree that domestic violence against women is justified. Such wide variation in women's responses raises concerns about the comparability of the underlying attitudinal question, and the validity of comparative research that assumes comparability. Using 67 DHS conducted in 48 countries between 1995 and 2007, we explored whether cross-national variation in women's affirmative responses to this question were explained by cross-national variation in survey design, socioeconomic conditions, or both. Variation in survey design had considerable predictive power and accounted for a non-trivial amount of the variance in women's affirmative responses. Including the survey-design variables also modestly altered associations of the outcome with structural variables of interest in comparative studies. These findings offer insights about future analyses and data collections on women's attitudes about domestic violence against women. 
1	Research regarding the impact Of repression on social movements has yielded conflicting findings; some argue that repression decreases the total quantity of protest events while others argue that it motivates protest. To move beyond this impasse, various scholars have suggested exploring how repression influences the quality of social movements. This study assesses the impact repression had on the formation of alliances between different social groups participating in South Korea's democracy movement. Results from negative binomial regression analyses show that repression facilitated the formation of alliances between movement actors at a time when the overall number of protest events decreased. This study contributes to the literature on coercion and mobilization by pointing to the possibility of movement development during low levels of a protest cycle.
0	Structural change in the U.S. dairy industry toward fewer and very large farms has fueled interest and government funding of research into the feasibility of constructing anaerobic digesters on large operations.  Environmental groups opposed to increasing scale and concentration in dairy also become opposed to AD technology as it is seen as facilitating concentration.  But, AD technology is essentially scale neutral as is seen by its application to very small farms around the world. The conflation of AD technology with large scale in the U.S. is a social construction brought about by its inclusion in the debates over agricultural industrialization.  Using a survey of dairy farmers in New York, we find that interest in AD technology occurs at all farm sizes. And that factors other than farm size are important in determining interest in the technology. We conclude that the technoscientific question raised by these findings is: will applications to, and interest of, smaller dairy farmer operators result in shifts in policy and funding priorities toward more diverse agricultural research agendas regarding AD technology?
0	This paper explores the various roles that children play in ethnographic research.  Based on the limited literature on children in the field, and drawing on examples from various ethnographies across social science disciplines, I identify four main roles for children: 1) as wedges, or as instrumentally important in terms of helping their parents gain access in various ways, 2) as collaborators, 3) as objects of study, and 4) as subjects of study. I also discuss the ways in which the roles of children in ethnography illuminate methodological issueslike reflexivity, validation, ethics, and power and agency.  This is the first attempt to integrate writings on taking children into the field and works on conducting fieldwork with children.  In thinking about the ways in which various child relationships affect the kinds of ethnographic work we produce, in both positive and negative ways, we can consider how best to integrate the worlds of adults and children in the field and in subsequent analysis.
1	This paper contributes to the growing body of research on participatory democracy and the literature on associational democracy by exploring the impact that institutional reforms have on local-level configurations of civil society. In the 1980s a wide range of participatory experiments were initiated in Brazil, most notably Participatory Budgeting in municipal governance. Municipios that adopted PB in principle devolve much or all of the decision making on new investments to decentralized participatory forums. In this paper we consider the results Of an eight-city matched-pair analysis conducted in 2004, in which we selected municipios that adopted PB in 1997-2000, and matched them with a similar municipio that did not in the same period, drawing from the full sample of municipios over 20,000 inhabitants. Building on relational theories of civil society, we show that PB has clear but limited effects on civil society. It moves civil society practices from clientelism to associationalism, but does not contribute to the capacity of civil society to self-organize, at least in the time-frame considered. We also show that this democratizing effect on civil society practices and networks is conditioned by pre-existing state-civil society relations.
0	How does the option to use direct legislation (DL, i.e., ballot initiatives and popular referenda) alter the political strategies and mobilization of social movements in the United States?  In a qualitative case study of two movements in four states over a period of ten years, I argue that we must refine our understanding of political opportunity structures and procedural democracy.  DL, although ostensibly equally accessible to all, does not affect the strategies of the gay/lesbian movement and its Christian conservative opponents in the same way.  While Christian conservatives use the DL process when it is available at the state level, the gay and lesbian movement never does.  This is partly a function of organizational infrastructure  Christian conservative groups can mobilize both voters and dollars, while gay rights groups must rely upon a combination of a smaller grassroots base and powerful interest-group allies.  In addition, this differential use results partly from the strategic opportunities available to each movement  political access has been declining during this period for Christian conservatives, while on the gay rights groups have cemented their alliance with the Democratic party.  Furthermore, because DL can function as a tool not just for policy change but also for mobilization, the Christian conservative movement is much more active generally, and concerned with gay rights specifically, in states that have DL.  This suggests more profoundly how direct democracy fundamentally affects the mobilization potential of different kinds groups, depending upon their ability to mobilize resources but also their ability to make majoritarian claims.
1	Nations and nationalism remain relevant even in the context of increased global integration. At the same time, as commodity chains become longer, more transnational, and increasingly complex, the linkages between national identity, global capitalism, and political and economic elites are evolving. In this article, we show how culture-expressed in terms of national attachment and collective heritage-is a key means by which elites assert their power along global commodity chains. Specifically, we use the tequila commodity chain as a lens for analyzing how notions of patrimony, and the attendant reliance on the language of shared collective experience, are mobilized to forward corporate agendas in the global marketplace. Focusing on the interplay between global processes and local responses, we argue that the Mexican state and tequila companies promote notions of nationalness at the expense of the agave farmers, small-scale distillers, and communities where tequila is produced. We show how three central themes are part of this process: the protection of place, the maintenance of quality, and the defense of national interests. This article illustrates how new forms of national attachments are emerging under globalization by integrating an analysis of culture into commodity chain research.
1	Sociologists consider inequality in educational attainment to be a major cause of inequality between people in their chances of occupying a more advantageous class position. However, there is dispute as to whether educational inequality according to social class background declined during the 20(th) century. What is not in doubt is the expansion of education in the advanced economies during this time, and several authors have pointed to educational expansion as a mechanism by which inequalities in social mobility chances may be reduced. I measure this effect and compare it with the impact of educational equalization on social mobility in Britain, Sweden and Germany during the 20(th) century. I find that in all three countries educational expansion promoted greater social mobility.
1	Using evidence from Durham, North Carolina, we examine the impact of school choice programs on racial and class-based segregation across schools. Reasonable assumptions about the distribution of preferences over race, class, and school characteristics suggest that the segregating choices of students from advantaged backgrounds are likely to outweigh any integrating choices by disadvantaged students. The results of our empirical analysis are consistent with these theoretical considerations. Using information on the actual schools students attend and on the schools in their assigned attendance zones, we find that schools in Durham are more segregated by race and class as a result of school choice programs than they would be if all Students attended their geographically assigned schools. In addition, we find that the effects of choice on segregation by class are larger than the effects on segregation by race. 
1	Institutional changes associated with the rise of shareholder value capitalism have had seemingly contradictory effects on managers and managerialism in the United States economy. Financial critiques of inefficient corporate bureaucracies and the resulting wave of downsizing, mergers, and computerization subjected managers to unprecedented layoffs during the 1980s and 1990s as firms sought to become lean and mean. Yet the proportion of managers and their average compensation continued to increase during this period. How did the rise of anti-managerial investor ideologies and strategies oriented toward reducing companies' labor costs coincide with increasing numbers of ever more highly paid managerial employees? This article examines the paradoxical relationship between shareholder value and managerialism by analyzing the effects of shareholder value strategies on the growth of managerial employment and managerial earnings in 59 major industries in the U.S. private sector from 1984 to 2001. Results from industry-level dynamic panel models show that layoffs, mergers, computerization, deunionization, and the increasing predominance of publicly traded firms all contributed to broad-based increases in the number of managerial positions and the valuation of managerial labor. Results are generally consistent with David Gordon's (1996) fat and mean thesis.
0	Hispanics are a large and growing share of the U.S. minority population, but their participation in a wide range of political endeavors is not thoroughly understood.  This is particularly true for the effect of their social contexts; previous research suggests that low-status communities can have both benefits and liabilities for political engagement.  Using nationally representative data from the 2002 and 2004 National Surveys of Latinos, I show that Hispanics individual socioeconomic resources are sufficient to involve them in registering to vote, but that their nativity and facility with the English language are more decisive for participation outside the formal electoral system.  The characteristics of their local contexts are also important, although they offset each other.  Hispanics most exposed to racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to be involved in electoral activities, but those in poor and poorly educated communities are more likely to be so engaged.  The mechanisms for these effects are unclear, though.  For example, attention to politics and experiences with discrimination act as suppressors, rather than mediators, of the contextual relationships.  Overall, then, there is no single model of Hispanics political participation; rather, the predictors vary by the form that participation takes.
0	This study examines the construction of Whiteness and Blackness in the photos of two popular parenting magazines.  Our analysis did not indicate that article pictures of African American children were ghettoized into certain topics areas, but we did find that African Americans are underrepresented in both ad and article pictures in these magazines.  Black children are also less likely than their White counterparts to be pictured with parents in general, and fathers in particular.  We argue that these results are indicative of the editors attempts to add strategically placed black children and parents in an effort to do diversity. By doing this the magazine editors promote a white vision of multiculturalism, which reinforces the normativity of Whiteness and preserves the marginality of Blackness in the presentation of American family life.
1	Scholars are often pessimistic about adolescent dating, linking it to increases in depression, interpersonal violence, conflict with parents, school failure, associations with delinquents, substance use, and offending. Yet, the various dimensions of dating may offered have opposing consequences. The closeness offered by adolescent romantic love may fill an important void found between the weakening of bonds with parents and the onset of adult attachments, and it may discourage an array of negative outcomes, including involvement in crime. Adolescent sexual activity, in contrast, may increase offending, in part by augmenting the strain created by relationships. When coupled with a romantic relationship, however, sex is likely less stressful and consequential for crime. In this article, we analyze patterns of romance, sexual behavior, and adolescent crime with panel data from the nationally representative Adolescent Health Survey. Findings support our expectations regarding differential effects of romance and sex. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results.for understanding adolescent delinquency, social attachments, and development.
1	"A spatial analysis of data for French departements assembled in the 1830s by Andre-Michel Guerry and Adolphe d'Angeville examines the impacts of modernization and resistance to governmental ""Frenchification"" policies on measures of violence and its direction. In the context of Unnithan et al.'s integrated model of suicide and homicide, high suicide rates in the northern core and a predilection for violence against others in the southern periphery may be consistently interpreted in terms of theories of the civilizing process and internal colonialism. Alternative explanations of southern violence in 19th-century France are explored and rejected, and additional theoretical applications are suggested."
1	The 2008 Democratic presidential primary provides a unique opportunity to examine how community structure is related to intra-party electoral outcomes. Because the contest between Barak Obama and Hilary Clinton remained competitive until the very end, we are able to analyze voting outcomes for more than 2,300 U.S. counties where votes were cast before the ultimate winner had been determined. The primary was also noteworthy because Obama was seeking to become the nation's first African American President, while Clinton hoped to be the first woman president. The competition, and the response that the candidates received from voters as they campaigned across the country, revealed interesting dynamics pertaining to race, class, and gender. We argue that Obama and Clinton appealed to constituencies on different sides of a cultural divide among Democratic voters, and that divide is rooted in occupational segregation. Our results show that occupational segregation by race, and especially by sex, are related to the voting outcomes, with Obama gaining his strongest support in the most integrated contexts and his weakest support in segregated contexts.
1	"This article charts key developments and cross-national variations in the coverage of foreign culture (i.e., classical and popular music, dance, film, literature, theater, television, and visual arts) in Dutch, French, German, and US. elite newspapers between 1955 and 2005. Such coverage signals the awareness of foreign culture among national elites and the degree and direction of ""globalization from within."" Using content analysis, we examine the degree, direction, and diversity of the international orientation of arts journalism for each country and cultural genre. Results denote how international arts and culture coverage has increased in Europe but not in the United States. Moreover the centrality of a country in the cultural ""world-system"" offers a better explanation for cross-national differences in international orientation than do other country-level characteristics, such as size and cultural policy framework. Recorded and performance-based genres differ markedly in their levels of internationalization, but the effect of other genre-level characteristics, such as language dependency and capital intensiveness, is not clear In each country, international coverage remains concentrated on a few countries, of which the United States has become the most prominent. Although the global diversity of coverage has increased, non-Western countries are still underrepresented."
1	"Using Swedish panel data, we assess whether the gender gap in supervisory authority has changed during the period 1968-2000, and investigate to what extent the gap can be attributed to gender-specific consequences of family formation. The results indicate that the gap has narrowed modestly during the period, and that the life-event of parenthood is a major cause. As long as women and men are childless and single, the gender gap in supervisory authority is marginal, even reversed. When men become fathers, however, they strongly increase their chances for supervisory authority whereas women's chances remain unaffected when they become mothers. We also find a male ""marriage premium"" on workplace authority, but this premium is generated by selection."
1	While great progress has been made in documenting that organizational practices affect workplace inequality, little is known about how managers in particular may shape the careers of the employees below them. Using unique longitudinal personnel data on managers and their subordinates, this study identifies and tests for evidence of three distinct mechanisms by which managers potentially influence the assessment of employee performance in the workplace: (1) social network influence between employees' current and former managers; (2) manager-manager (horizontal) homophily; and (3) manager-employee (vertical) homophily. I find evidence of the independent effects of all three mechanisms of managerial influence on the outcome of disagreement in the performance evaluation ratings of the same worker between former and current managers. In particular, my results stress that both managerial network influence and horizontal homophily affect the process of employee performance assessments, over and above the well-studied vertical homophily mechanism. I conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of these findings for future research regarding the interactional aspects of workplace inequality within contemporary organizations.
0	Social space-informed research suggests that spatial context produces different articulations of sexual subjectivity.  However, little has been produced on how these temporal and spatially-bounded identities are shaped by sexual desire. According to Sexual Fields Theory, sexual actors are hierarchically organized according to their level of attractiveness into “sexual fields”. Whether an actor is considered attractive will vary temporally and spatially, as one moves between different sexual fields.  Examining an emerging space for queer sociality in Toronto Canada, I interview 17 gay men who identify with the area. I show how hierarchies of sexual desirability shape sexual actors’ sense of self and that processes of identification are negotiated through physical space. Within the context of this sexual field and space, I find that maximizing one’s sexual desirability means emphasizing how “cool” rather than how “sexy” one is. How they perform their gayness is shaped by the criterion upon which attractiveness is determined and as a result, how their gay identity figures into their sense of self changes.
0	A persistent finding in the research on commute time is that women commute less than men.  Two major explanations for this are 1) that womens responsibility for domestic labor requires her to work closer to home and 2) that women choose shorter commutes because their returns to commute are less than men.  This paper analyzes the difference in partners commute time across married, cohabiting, and gay and lesbian partners and finds that lesbians and gay men are not like their heterosexual counterparts.  Gay men and lesbians are similar to their partners in terms of commute time and the difference in their commute time relative to their partners is much smaller than the difference in commute time between partners in heterosexual relationships.  These findings support the proposition that womens shorter commute times reflect labor market restrictions and a lower investment in human capital.
1	A recent debate in sociological exchange theory concerns which form of exchange is likely to promote cohesion in exchange relations. One side maintains that bilateral exchange, often associated with economic transactions, entails joint action to share mutual benefits, contributing more to feelings of cohesion than do independent acts of unilateral giving from one person to another, typical of social exchange. The other side argues that bilateral exchange requires dividing resources under binding terms of exchange, which strains relationships by underscoring competitive aspects of exchange. The present study reconciles these divergent claims by testing a new model of exchange that combines key propositions from past theories to specify when bilateral exchange promotes or undermines cohesion. Results from two laboratory experiments provide support for the model's core claim that cooperative forms of bilateral exchange can reinforce cohesion more than unilateral exchange does, contrary to the enduring assumption that economic exchange undermines relational bonds.
1	This article reports findings from a recent survey of international migration from China's Fujian Province to the United States. Using the ethnosurvey approach developed in the Mexican Migration Project, the authors conducted surveys in migrant-sending communities in China as well as in destination communities in New York City. Hypotheses are derived from the international migration literature and the market transition debate. The results are generally consistent with hypotheses derived from cumulative causation of migration; however, geographical location creates some differences in migration patterns to the United States. In China as in Mexico, the existence of migration networks increases the propensity of migration for others in the community. In contrast to the Mexican case, among Chinese immigrants, having a previously migrated household member increases the propensity of other household members to migrate only after the debt for previous migration is paid off. In step with market transition theory, the authors also find that political power influences the migration experience from the coastal Fujian Province.
1	"This study advances a conceptual framework for understanding the transformation of places into recovery machines after major hurricanes. This framework contends that in the years following such disasters, pro-growth coalitions take advantage Of new sources of material and symbolic capital to promote further demographic growth. It also contends that the spatial nature of this growth varies significantly as a result of social inequalities among residential subpopulations, contributing to uneven transformation of local neighborhoods across affected regions. To test hypotheses derived from this framework, we combine innovative Geographic Information Systems data from ""billion dollar"" storms of the early 1990s with demographic data from local census tracts. Results support the recovery machine framework and imply that post-disaster resilience may contribute to the creation of larger, more segregated versions of affected regions that await exposure with the next major disaster."
0	A bevy of research has demonstrated that Black older adults have poorer health outcomes relative to White older adults, including greater morbidity (Manton and Stallard 1997), more limited access to health care (Smedley et al. 2003), and higher risk of death (Elo and Preston 1997).  The prevailing explanation for the health and mortality gap between Black and White Americans is that it stems from differences in socioeconomic status.  Little research has examined how community may affect Black and White adults differently, contributing to the extensively documented racial health disparities.  Thus, using the North Carolina EPESE panel study of Black and White adults ages 65 and over, this research makes two contributions:  it extends examination of place to disability rather than mortality, and it focuses on disparities in both rural and urban areas.  Latent growth curve trajectories of IADL disability are estimated with and without predictors.  Results indicate that rural Black residents are the most disabled at baseline and increase in disability at the fastest rate over time.  Urban Black residents are the second-most disabled group.  Both urban and rural White older adults have significantly less IADL disability and slower trajectories over time.  An interaction between income and rural area indicates that for those of the same income level, Black or White older adults who live in rural areas are more disabled at baseline and over time.  The discussion considers the unique pathways that may link rural areas to health.
1	The authors propose that a trade-off between network diversity and communications bandwidth regulates access to novel information because a more diverse network structure increases novelty at a cost of reducing information flow. Received novelty then depends on whether (a) the information overlap is small enough, (b) alters' topical knowledge is shallow enough, and (c) alters' knowledge stocks refresh slowly enough to justify bridging structural holes. Social network and e-mail content from an executive recruiting firm show that bridging ties can actually offer less novelty for these reasons, suggesting that the strength of weak ties and structural holes depend on brokers' information environments.
0	How has Information Technology (IT) penetrated our life?  Given its near-ubiquity, I contend it may be time to consider IT as a candidate for a social institution, albeit an emerging one.  To define IT, I apply Orlikowski and Iacono’s (2001) ensemble view that recognizes its proliferation has to jointly consider both its technical components and attendant social negotiation. While I offer provisional evidence that IT exhibits characteristics of social institutions, it may be premature to claim it has become a full-fledged one, given its recent prevalence. Furthermore, how it is becoming one remains unclear.  To that, I draw on Max Weber’s rationalization theory as one possible explanation. Using selected data from the 1979-2001 National Science Foundation Surveys of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology, my findings also surface an interesting challenge to how current literature theorizes the relationship between formal and substantive rationality.  Last, I highlight the limitations of my study and suggest potential streams of research that will profit by treating IT as a nascent social institution.
1	This study explores the predictors of religious participation among US immigrants. We analyze data from the General Social Surveys (GSS), along with contextual data from 30 nations derived from the World Values Survey and the World Christian Encyclopedia (WCE). We compare the rates of religious participation of first and second generation immigrants to GSS respondents of more distant immigrant waves. We also compare the predictors of religious participation across nativity groups, and examine the influence of demographic, denominational, and contextual-level religious market factors on immigrants' religious participation using hierarchical linear models (HLM). We find that immigrant religious participation is similar to other Americans, and that second generation immigrants with a single immigrant parent are the least active. Immigrants with ties to sectarian Christian groups or to the Catholic Church are significantly more active than other immigrants. Neither religious diversity in the country of origin nor the differences from the US market have a significant effect on immigrants' religious participation. However, immigrants from Catholic nations have high rates of participation, while immigrants from nations with high rates of apostasy have lower rates of participation net of individual factors. 
1	From 1975 to 2005, the variance in incomes of American families with children increased by two-thirds. In attempting to explain this trend, labor market studies emphasize the rising pay of college graduates, while demographers typically highlight the implications of family structural changes across time. In this article, we join these lines of research by conceiving of income inequality as the joint product of the distribution of earnings in the labor market and the pooling of incomes in families. We develop this framework with a decomposition of family income inequality using annual data from the March Current Population Survey. Our analysis shows that disparities in education and single parenthood contributed to income inequality, but rising educational attainment and women employment offset these effects. Most of the increase infamily income inequality was due to increasing within-group inequality, which was widely shared across family types and levels of schooling.
1	One path to cultural innovation in artistic and literary fields is differentiation of a genre into new subgenres. But what are the dynamics at work in such a process? This article addresses that question by identifying and explaining the emergence and trajectory of a new fiction subgenre-the American labor problem novel-during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. I make a theoretical case for the intersection of social movement fields and cultural production fields showing, through a historical sociological analysis, that this subgenre was the joint product of: (1) a shift in literary aesthetic practice resulting from the rise of realism, (2) the subgenre dialogical character (3) collective contention surrounding the rise of labor movement militancy, and (4) the exigencies of literary and popular culture markets. The historical conjuncture of these processes contributed to a repository of cultural constructions of class in storied form, as novelists sought to both entertain and educate readers about the emerging realities of class-contentious industrial society. This study demonstrates the fruitfulness of merging sociology of culture theory and social movement outcome perspectives when analyzing cultural change.
0	The question of working-class formation is fundamentally a search for the linkage between the objective process of proletarianization and workers’ subjective reaction. This paper aims to reconstruct a new theory in the light of historical institutionalism, which stresses the significance of pre-existing rules that generate the intra-class differences as well as multiple forms of class activism. Even though the thesis of exceptionalism is rightfully criticized, I argue most literatures still follow the Sombartian “why not” question in assuming the standard scenario of a political movement propelled by unified class solidarity. I also critique the Thompsonian culturalism for its inattention to institutional factors and the danger of radical constructionism.
0	"This paper is mainly a qualitative look at Vance County, North Carolina. Vance County is typical of many of the so-called \""Black Belt\"" counties in the Southeastern US. There is a high amount of inequality among the races both economically and educationally. Through interviews and participant observation, we were able to ascertain an outsiders perspective of Vance County. The purpose of the paper is to gain a better understanding of Vance County, and understanding why the poverty rates are so high."
0	A new variety of slavery exists today, the result of forms of forced servitude that existed alongside slavery many centuries ago.  In some contemporary societies, children especially, live and work under slavery conditions that deny them their freewill while subjecting them to control through violent threats and physical abuse.  This is tantamount to slavery.  There is, however, a critical lack of awareness about important aspects of the reality of this new child slavery.  The framework and definitions of slavery in usage today, though interesting and sufficient to cover historical situations, are unable to adequately describe the conditions of the child slavery.  Using existing literature and research, this thesis conceptualizes childrens labor in a manner that allows a clearer perception of the exploitation of their labor within and beyond the household.  Explanatory factors such as culture, the age of victims, the number of hours worked and the ability or not of the victim to volunteer or withdraw their participation in the specific activities are employed to determine if particular situations should be considered as child slavery.
0	A substantial amount of research centers on the connection between school and work. Despite these linkages, expectant graduates of all educational levels face increasing employment uncertainty. The following paper examines this doubt by asking: Why do recent college graduates participate in short-term, paid service programs? Interview responses from participants in one such program, Teach For America, revealed a process closely wedded to higher educational institutions. When students expressed career uncertainty, actors in their institutional setting suggested paid service programs as a post graduation option. Familiarity with service work through opportunities offered in undergraduate study and programmatic benefits, including a salary, loan deferment, and organizational prestige tipped the decision-making scale in favor of participation. Involvement enabled them to skirt the costs of uncertainty, namely unemployment. Thus, these programs act as a kind of moratorium on adulthood that allows for continued occupational exploration. The procedural connection to these programs with tertiary institutions has a consequence of only providing relief to uncertain educational elites. This contributes to the preservation of existing stratification hierarchies. Furthermore, the entry process described here is an institutionalized response to the individual and not an individual response to an institution. Therefore, altering current depictions of individual-institutional interactions.
1	"We examine the manner in which voluntary associations expose individuals to differing perspectives, or ""cross-talk."" Specifically we develop hypotheses based on the interactive roles of elite bias and homophily in structuring networks of democratic participation and test them on social network data of Los Angeles neighborhood councils. We find that homophily leads to boards less diverse than their communities, but does not lead to homogeneous cliques within boards. Moreover, we find that elite bias and homophily counteract each other in lower-status communities, leading to more diverse boards than would be predicted by homophily alone. We then examine the effects of assortative mixing on political attitudes and collective action, and find weak support for the proposition that associational diversity promotes tolerance and access to information."
0	Based on a qualitative study of 28 women and men who had used fertility treatments, this paper outlines how physicians define infertility, the different views of infertility and women's bodies based on the type of physician seen, and the inherent focus on women's bodies in the diagnostic process.  Last, I posit that one specific diagnosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, may be a new case of the medicalization of women's bodies.
0	We investigate the frequency, types, and psychological correlates of both major and day-to-day interpersonal discrimination experienced by underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese Americans. Analyses are based on data from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study, a national population survey of more than 3,000 adults ages 25 to 74 in 1995. Severely obese persons (Body Mass Index > 35) are significantly more likely to report experiences of major discrimination (including employment and health-care related discrimination) as well as day-to-day interpersonal discrimination. Among the severely obese, professional workers are more likely than non-professionals to report employment discrimination and interpersonal mistreatment. Severely obese persons report significantly lower levels of self-acceptance than persons with normal weight, yet this relationship is fully mediated by the perception that one has been discriminated against due to body weight or physical appearance. Our findings offer further support for the pervasive stigma of obesity, and for the reflected appraisals perspective on self. Although obesity is increasingly common in the United States, obese persons are still subject to important forms of institutional and interpersonal mistreatment.
1	This paper tests Samuel and Pearl Oliner's theory that extensivity is a cause of prosocial behaviors, using data from the 1995 and 2005 waves of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey. Principal components analysis of a set of 19 questions about moral obligations supports the Oliners' contention that some individuals have a constricted moral sense, meaning that they feel stronger obligations to help family members and friends than strangers, while others have an extensive moral sense and feel obligated to help both close and distant others. Tobit regression demonstrates that people with extensive moral obligations are more likely than people with constricted obligations to engage in volunteer work and charitable giving. These results provide independent support for the Oliners' theory, and encourage further research on extensivity. 
0	Animals rights and anti-abortion activists are not commonly thought to have much in common. The truth, however, is more complicated. Both have a strong focus on the preservation of life and the prevention of suffering, and it is possible to interpret their interests in terms of at least a partially common cause. Viewed from this perspective, the strong resistance of pro-life activists to associations with the animal rights movement is worthy of consideration. Who benefits and who loses from such an alliance? What is the underlying social mechanism that maintains the status quo of bitter division?
1	While police levels may affect crime, governments may react to crime by increasing police levels. The instrumental variables (IV) approach to this problem has proven difficult due to the problem of locating instruments for police levels. Using panel data from over 5000 cities (1990-2001), we instrumented police levels with two types of federal law enforcement grants, thus yielding over-identified models. We also subjected our instruments to both relevance and validity testing, a step authors of similar studies have yet to take. We found fairly robust inverse associations between police levels and four index crime rates (homicide, robbery, assault, and burglary), but mainly in large cities. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

0	The overall purpose of this paper is to examine cross-national differences in drug-related violence among youth in three sites that vary in social and political culture and drug-use policies  Philadelphia, Toronto and Amsterdam.  The Drug-Alcohol Violence International (DAVI) study assesses not only site variation, but also assesses sample variation, including samples of both detainees and dropouts.  This paper examines cross-national differences in drug use and violence in bivariate analyses.  More importantly, logistic regression analyses determine the major correlates of drug-related violence, controlling sample differences.  Drug-related violence is defined in two waysthe first based on Goldsteins tripartite model of drug-related violence, and the other based on whether the respondents and/or the others involved in the violent incident reported any alcohol or illicit drug use on the day of the incident.  We find that Philadelphia youth are more likely to attribute violence to drug use than youth in Amsterdam and Toronto.  Neither sample (detainee versus drop-out) nor gender were significant correlates of drug-related violence.  There are differences in the important correlates of violence by site, as well as some differences based on the definition of drug-related violence.  Multivariate analyses show that neither patterns of drug use nor drug market involvement are uniformly related to violence.  Drug dealing was an important correlate of drug related violence only in the Toronto site.  Binge drinking was an important correlate in Philadelphia, and marijuana in Amsterdam.  Interesting, when attributing the violence to drugs as was required in the tripartite definition, the Toronto youth who used marijuana were less likely to view the violence as drug related.  However, Toronto youth who used marijuana were more likely to report they or the others were using alcohol or drugs on the day of the most violent event they experienced in the past year.  Other correlates of drug related violence were if the violence occurred after midnight, on a weekend, and if more than one other person was involved.
0	: Like all movements, contemporary global movements draw on and share characteristics of earlier movements. However, there are some significant features of the contemporary global movements that reflect the changing context in which they operate and which distinguish them from earlier NSMs. Drawing on a variety of academic and activist sources, including findings drawn from an in-depth ethnography of an anti-capitalist autonomous network in Madrid from July 2002-January 2005, the author highlights in particular the centrality of the notion of autonomy and the creation of autonomous spaces; the centrality of issues of participatory democracy; the emergence of a new global actor who identifies with a global movement; the consolidation of the network as organizational framework and of the sovereign assembly as legitimate arena for decision making; the strong resurgence of anarchist and libertarian influence; a repertory of action that moves beyond the purely symbolic to a re-engagement with capitalism as the focus of direct action and critique; a shift away from identitarian and ideological politics to an embracing of diversity as a core value; the re-definition of the public sphere as a commons, but also as an arena in which to negotiate conflict and difference; and in Western Europe at least, the emerging consciousness of a precarious subject.
1	This analysis examines how the spatial concentration of Southern whites is associated with white argument-based lethal violence. Using a well-known measure of spatial segregation (V, the adjusted P* index) among Southern-born whites in US. counties in 2000, the results reveal that the spatial concentration of Southern-born whites is only moderately correlated with their overall representation within counties. This confirms that the quantity of Southerners in an area is not the same thing as their spatial distribution within that same area. Multivariate negative binomial regression models confirm that white argument homicide rates are higher where white Southerners are more spatially concentrated, a link that is confined to Southern counties. The findings illustrate the important role spatial arrangements may play in producing expressive violence among white Southerners.
1	This research used geocoded data from 11 waves (2000-2010) of the German Socioeconomic Panel Study to investigate the spatial distances of young adults initial move-outs (N = 2113) from their parents' homes. Linear regression models predicted moving distances by factors at individual, family, household, and community level. Overall, home leavers moved across very small distances with a median value of less than 10 km. Greater distances were found for well-educated and childless home leavers who moved out at relatively young ages from high-income households located in less-urbanized regions. In line with developmental models of migration, young adults stayed closer if the parental household was still located at their place of childhood. We conclude that considering the spatial distance of move-outs may advance our understanding of individual passages to adulthood and intergenerational relations across the life course. 
0	The securitization of an ever-expanding number of realms is a distinguishing feature of the contemporary political landscape. This paper summarizes the perspectives on securitization offered by three existing approaches: Critical Security Studies, Foucauldian state analyses, and repression frameworks from the collective behavior and social movements literature. It considers the contributions and limitations of each of these perspectives in the sociocultural analysis of securitization. It then draws upon a case study of securitization in Spain at the turn of the 20th century and a look at what is new in order to investigate the provenance of contemporary securitization, to develop the critique of existing perspectives, and to demonstrate how these approaches can be synthesized and built upon in developing a sociological approach to the phenomenon.
1	"This research demonstrates how affect control theory and its computer program, Interact, can be used to develop empirically-grounded hypotheses regarding the connection between cultural labels and behaviors. Our demonstration focuses on propositions in the modified labeling theory of mental illness. According to the M LT, negative societal conceptions of the mentally ill become personally relevant upon diagnosis and damage psychiatric patients' self-concept. This, in turn, increases patients' use of three coping behaviors: concealing treatment history, educating others about mental illness and withdrawing from social interaction. We evaluate these propositions by analyzing data generated from Interact simulations that incorporate self-meaning data gathered from psychiatric patients. We produce six general principles about the way patients' stigma sentiments (evaluation, potency and activity associated with the cultural category ""a mentally ill person"") and diagnostic category (adjustment, affective, schizophrenic) jointly shape patients' predicted use of these coping behaviors."
1	"The article extends the multi-institutional model of power and change through an analysis of the American Indian Sovereignty Movement. Drawing upon cultural models of the state, and articulating institutionalist conceptions of political opportunities and resources, the analysis demonstrates that this framework can be applied to challenges addressing the state as well as nonstate fields. The rational-legal diminishment of tribal rights, bureaucratic paternalism, commonsense views of tribes as racial/ethnic minorities, and the binary construction of American and Indian as oppositional identities diminished the appeal of ""contentious"" political action. Instead, to establish tribes' status as sovereign nations, tribal leaders aggressively enacted infrastructural power, transposed favorable legal rulings across social fields to legitimize sovereignty discourses, and promoted a pragmatic coexistence with state and local governments. Identifying the United States as a settler colonial society, the study suggests that a decolonizing framework is more apt than racial/ethnicity approaches in conceptualizing the struggle of American Indians."
0	"The ""interimperial"" field of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Pacific included Spain, Great Britain, Japan, and the United States, consisting not only of competition over land and trade claims but also of exchanges of imperialist technologies, centrally including violence. The United States was also involved in an ""intraimperial field"" of metropole and colony, in which imperialist violence was a key factor. In taking the Philippines as a colony, the United States developed an accompanying discourse of exceptionalism dubbed as ""benevolent assimilation,"" differentiating its empire from that of other empires. That the U.S. required an exceptionalist discourse to legitimate its imperialist endeavors was a result of its nationalist historical-narrative claiming democratic traditions as fundamental to its existence as a nation-state. Along with this statist narrative was an accompanying cultural narrative of an evangelical process of ""civilization"" and progress that white Americans would bring to racialized groups. In this paper, I lay out the interimperial and intraimperial fields of U.S. imperialism, following the transnational path of imperialist violence rendered on racialized bodies, those ""exceptionally"" included through their exclusions. Tracing imperialist violence through these fields, I look at the nationalist cultural conditions that made this violence and its corresponding opposition possible."
1	This project employs a moral solidarity framework to explore the relationship between organized religion and lynching in the American South. The authors ask whether a county's religious composition affected its rate of lynching, net of demographic and economic controls. The authors find evidence for the solidarity thesis, using three religious metrics. First, their findings show that counties with greater religious diversity experienced more lynching, supporting the notion that a pluralistic religious marketplace with competing religious denominations weakened the bonds of a cohesive moral community and might have enhanced white racial solidarity. Second, counties in which a larger share of the black population worshipped in churches controlled by blacks experienced higher levels of racial violence, indicating a threat to intergroup racially based solidarity. Finally, the authors find a lower incidence of lynching in counties where a larger share of church members belonged to racially mixed denominations, suggesting that cross-racial solidarity served to reduce racial violence.
0	The relationship between gender and religion is explored by examining changing gender role ideologies.  Using data from the 1970 National Fertility Survey and the 1995 cycle of the National Survey of Family Growth we examine the association between religious group membership and importance of religion on three dimensions of gender role ideology:  familial, equal opportunity, and pro-family.  The results suggest the declining significance of religion on all three dimensions.  Women hold much more egalitarian gender ideologies in 1995 than in 1970 and many of the differences by religious group that were apparent in 1970 have disappeared by 1995.  The findings raise questions about how much religion ever had a constituting authority over gender relations, suggesting instead that religion may adapt to gender relationsespecially in modern societies.
0	In the extant cross-national research on homicide rates, one of the most consistent findings is the positive effect of income inequality (see Nivette 2011).   More recently,  a new perspective has emerged, which directly challenges the robustness of income inequality as a predictor of cross-national homicide.  Specifically, this new perspective argues that, net of the income inequality, poverty has a stronger effect on homicide (Pridemore 2008, 2011).  However, in this literature, little attention has been given to the differential effect these two conditions may have on gender-based homicide rates.   Further, to date, no cross-national study has estimated these effects net of structural changes, such as the growth of female labor force participation. Using an unbalanced panel sample of 58 countries (1995-2007), we test the effects of both income inequality and infant mortality on gender-based homicide rates. Surprisingly, the results fail to confirm previous findings on the robust relationships between income inequality, poverty, and homicide.  Overall, infant mortality, as a cross-national proxy for poverty, has a slight positive effect on overall, male, and female homicide rates, while income inequality showed no association with any type of homicide.  In fact, the most consistent effects on homicide are economic development and labor force participation.  These results call into question previous findings on the structural determinants, which may be susceptible to numerous methodological issues.
0	Todays communities have been greatly affected by the Internet.  All fundamental aspects of our business, political, and social communities have been influenced in some way or another, and even dramatically transformed by this recent technology.  Concerning past technologies, it was believed that the introduction of the telephone, and later the television, would cause the community and community ties to slowly diminish.  Community was considered to be lost from its original environment, the familiar place - the local village or neighborhood.  Then came the argument that community could be regained in the environment of shared space, mostly work or voluntary groups.  Now with the recent introduction of the Internet, there has been the evolving belief that the community can be regained through the digital environment of cyberspace.  More specifically, an increased number of religious individuals are forming their own virtual communities, for religious purposes.  This study explores Internet users and non-users, and specifically those of religious faith, who are seeking a renewed sense of community and stronger community ties via the Internet.  The analysis is based on data from the Pew Internet Project, The Internet and American Life, which includes 2000 American households. This empirical research explores the impact of the Internet on community ties and religious communities.  The findings indicate that the Internet may lead to a renewed community, and that individuals can use the Internet not only for their social and economic needs, but also their spiritual needs.
1	Research on the consequences of social movements typically aims to identify determinants of success or to draw attention to ways that social movements are able to secure new benefits for constituents by gaining concessions from political authorities. Yet social movements, even those that are ultimately defeated, may have an enduring impact on the communities in which they were once active. This impact may be far removed from the movement's stated goals and may be detrimental to constituents and to society at large. We identify an empirical relationship between Ku Klux Klan activism in the 1960s and increased numbers of homicides in southern U.S. counties in subsequent decades. We explain this finding by drawing attention to ways in which right-wing extremism can disrupt community cohesion, generate mistrust in legal authorities, and promote interpretations of conflict and conflict resolution that weaken constraints on violent behavior.
1	This paper asks whether maternal employment has a lasting influence on the division of household labor for married women and men. Employing multi-level models with 2002 ISSP survey data for 31 countries, we test the lagged accommodation hypothesis that a long societal history of maternal employment contributes to more egalitarian household arrangements. Our results find that living in a country with a legacy of high maternal employment is positively associated with housework task-sharing, even controlling for the personal socialization experience of growing up with a mother who worked for pay. In formerly socialist countries, however, there is less gender parity in housework than predicted by the high historical level of maternal employment. 
1	We study effects of explicit and implicit interethnic attitudes on ethnic discrimination in hiring. Unlike explicit attitudes, implicit attitudes are characterised by reduced controllability, awareness or intention. Effects of implicit interethnic attitudes on ethnic discrimination in the labour market remain under-researched. Moreover, previous experiments on the effects of explicit interethnic attitudes on discrimination have important drawbacks. We use data from a laboratory experiment (n = 272) consisting of an Implicit Association Test, a questionnaire and a recruitment test in which participants reviewed resumes representing fictitious applicants who varied regarding ethnicity, gender, education and work experience. Participants graded applicants and selected applicants for an interview. Results show that only explicit interethnic attitudes affect discrimination in grades, but both explicit and implicit interethnic attitudes increase discrimination in selection. 
1	Unlike traditional research on educational stratification that focuses on the pursuit of higher education, our study examines why young adults do not make the transition to college, using a nationally representative sample of college non-enrollees (N = 2640). In applying latent class analysis techniques, we identified multiple types of students who do not pursue college. One group of non-enrollees (27.6%) reports forgoing college because the economic barriers are too high - either because of college affordability or family financial responsibility. These youth had both low math test scores and low family income, and thus closely align with regression-based analyses on college enrollment that emphasize academic and economic constraints as the central barriers to educational progress. However, we also identified a second, often overlooked group of youth who had the academic preparation and family income support to enroll in higher education, but decided to forgo college because they preferred to work and to make money (18.3%). The heterogeneous motives of these youth suggest that postsecondary decisions are not always guided by academic and economic barriers, but sometimes driven by previous work experience and perceptions of local opportunities for school and work. 
0	Sociologists who study emotions and mental health often examine similar concepts and processes, and sometimes employ similar methodologies. However, few attempts have been made to delineate potential sources of synergy in the theoretical and empirical perspectives that each brings to bear on the study of emotional well-being. Our paper focuses special attention on anger, drawing upon the sociology of emotions literature to frame anger as a social emotion. Then, we survey literature in the sociology of mental health in order to illustrate the role of anger in stress processes. One of our central aims is to extend the research focus beyond anger as simply another outcome in the stress process to its potential role as a mediating and moderating condition. In doing so, we attempt to integrate core themes from sociology of emotions research to inform and develop our arguments.
1	"Wealth production within a ""risk society"" typically depends on production technologies that expose citizens to dangerous substances. Knowledge of such exposure is, more often than not, hidden from the public. Empirical analyses show that citizens' claims of illnesses caused by risky exposures are frequently contested by the institutions that select production technologies and control information: the government, corporations, and physicians. In this article, we use the risk society thesis as a framework for addressing gaps in the environmental illness literature-specifically, the basis for authorities' contestations of illness claims for which the exposure-illness link is scientifically confirmed. Using case methods, including in-depth interviews with 124 citizens, analyses center on the contested illness claims of nuclear weapons workers at the federal Oak Ridge Nuclear Reservation. Results highlight how institutional and organizational resources provided authorities with tactical leverage, and allowed them to manufacture an ambiguous climate for public discourse. This discourse focused on the exposure-illness link for a particular individual and their specific symptoms rather than the established exposure-illness links in general. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for analyses of environmental exposure specifically, but also the seemingly contradictory tension between the risk society need to restrict information to experts and democracy need for open discourse."
0	Integrating objective and constructionist approaches to collective memory, this paper takes the first step in developing sociological approach to martyrdom through an examination of the case of Che Guevara.  The construction and maintenance of individuals as martyrs is most often and most successfully done through the actions of powerful and resourceful states and institutions. The efforts of Cuba to control the facts of Guevaras life and the efforts of Bolivia to hide his body illustrate tactics institutions and states use in the attempt to control the reputation of martyrs.  The lack of control Cuba holds over the use of the famous photo of Guevara shows that in the increasingly globalized market and media, this manipulation and control is increasingly difficult, introducing questions of what martyrdom means and how it operates in contemporary society.
1	Ethnic residential concentration is often found to hamper immigrants' majority language proficiency. However, there are still several gaps in our understanding of the relationship between ethnic concentration and ethnic minorities' language practices. This study examines the extent to which ethnic concentration also constrains immigrants' majority language use, whether contact with natives and co-ethnics mediates these relationships, and whether ethnic concentration relates to second-generation minorities' minority language proficiency. Structural equation models on data for people of Turkish and Moroccan origin living in the Netherlands (N = 2163) showed that ethnic concentration is indirectly related to weaker majority language proficiency and less majority language use through contact with natives and co-ethnics. For second-generation minorities, ethnic concentration is related to better minority language proficiency. 
0	This paper examines hip-hop as a global, national, and local subcultural phenomenon tied directly to the negotiation of ethno-racial identities.  The African American diasporic origins and evolution of hip-hop are examined in this context.  The extent to which non-black diasporic youth in Western Europe have embraced blackness as part of their emerging collective identity is investigated.  This paper proposes that elements of hip-hop have been contextualized by diasporic minority youth subcultures that seek to synthesize the global with the local.  British South Asians and French North Africans are examples of such racially amorphous groups whose youth have embraced hip-hop in some form or fashion.  Living in diaspora and away from their native homelands, second and third generation cohorts appear to be forging new ethno-racial identities by combining elements of their parents culture with those of black-inflected hip-hop.
1	Rational choice approaches to reducing terrorist violence would suggest raising the costs of terrorism through punishment, thereby reducing the overall expected utility of terrorism. In this article, we argue that states should also consider raising the expected utility of abstaining from terrorism through rewards. We test effects of repressive (or punishing) and conciliatory (or rewarding) actions on terrorist behavior using the newly developed GATE-Israel dataset, which identifies events by Israeli state actors toward Palestinian targets on a full range of counterterrorism tactics and policies from 1987 to 2004. Results show that repressive actions are either unrelated to terror or related to subsequent increases in terror, and conciliatory actions are generally related to decreases in terror, depending on the tactical period. Findings also reveal the importance of understanding the role of terrorists' constituencies for reducing violence.
1	How do social movements affect decisions within corporations, such as the commercialization of new technologies? We suggest that the effect of movement activism is conditioned by the internal polity and therefore, varies across organizations. This article examines how the anti-genetic movement in Germany during the 1980s affected six domestic pharmaceutical firms' commercialization of biotechnology We develop a process model of how movements penetrate the relatively closed polity of private organizations. External contestation weakened the position of internal champions of biotechnology, precipitated divisions among organizational elites, and undermined collective commitment to the technology The movement also increased perceptions of investment uncertainty but the consequences of this uncertainty depended on organizational logics of decision making. As a result, investments in some firms were tilted away from domestic biotechnology projects. The model also explains this variation in organization-level outcomes of movement contestation.
1	This article investigates patterns of spatial assimilation of Hispanics in U.S. metropolitan areas. Using restricted-use data from the 2000 Census, we calculate Hispanics' levels of residential segregation by race and nativity and then estimate multivariate models to examine the association of group characteristics with these patterns. To obtain a more nuanced view of spatial assimilation, we use alternative reference groups in the segregation calculations-Anglos, African Americans, and Hispanics not of the same race. We find that Hispanics experience multiple and concurrent forms of spatial assimilation across generations: U.S.-born White, Black, and other-race Hispanics tend to be less segregated from Anglos, African Americans, and US.-born Hispanics not of the same race than are the foreign-born of the respective groups. We find some exceptions, suggesting that race continues to influence segregation despite the general strength of assimilation-related factors: Black Hispanics display high levels of segregation from Anglos, and U.S.-born Black Hispanics are no less segregated from other Hispanic groups than are their foreign-born counterparts.
0	Age-period-cohort models have an intriguing appeal because each of these factors may be independently associated with age-period-specific rates (or other values).  The problem is that one can not uniquely estimate these effects because they are linearly dependent.  We can, however, estimate certain linear functions of these individual effects that are themselves unique estimates – these are “estimable functions.”  In this paper, we show why it is possible to estimate unique functions of parameters that are themselves not uniquely estimable.  We do this by showing that all of the least square estimates (of the unidentified parameters) in the APC model lie on a straight line and how this allows one to find linear functions of these unidentified parameters that are themselves identified.  This leads to a simple criterion for finding which functions are estimable in APC models.  This simple criterion has not previously been exploited to investigate the range of linear functions that are estimable.
1	Previous research has found that a nation's income inequality does not affect its happiness inequality. This article questions the appropriateness of the standard deviation as measure of happiness inequality used in these studies. Our main criticism concerns structural dependency, i.e. the technical dependency of the standard deviation on a nation's mean happiness which is induced by measuring happiness with limited rating scales. To overcome this drawback, two new measures are proposed which adjust for the effects of limited instruments. Applying these new measures to the most recent World Values Survey data demonstrates that some countries change their ranking in the league table of happiness inequality considerably. Moreover, income inequality does affect corrected happiness inequality, a finding which has significant public policy implications. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	Studies of gene-environment interplay typically focus on one environmental factor at a time, resulting in a constrained view of social context. The concept of environmental contingency is introduced as a corrective. Drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and qualitative comparative analysis, the authors focus on an example involving social capital, a gene associated with a dopamine receptor (DRD2), and educational continuation beyond secondary school. For boys, (1) DRD2 risk is associated with a decreased likelihood of school continuation; (2) one configuration of social capital-high parental socioeconomic status, high parental involvement in school, and a high-quality school-compensates for this negative relationship, consistent with environmental contingency; but (3) boys with DRD2 risk are less commonly observed in settings that are rich in social capital.
1	"Neurobiological and social psychological studies suggest the existence of non-conscious 'self-other overlap' that can lead individuals to identify with other individuals or groups. This paper investigates whether this effect may help to explain support by some Whites for an otherwise unpopular policy on behalf of African Americans-slavery reparations. A representative telephone survey (n = 1200) serves as baseline of comparison for an online reaction time study with a non-representative sample (n = 1341) that measures 'self-other overlap' (interchangeably referred to as ""implicit closeness"" to Blacks). Partial proportional odds ordered logit analyses reveal implicit closeness to Blacks as the single most powerful predictor of support for reparations among White respondents. The magnitude of the absolute effect of implicit closeness exceeds that of traditional predictors such as racial resentment, ideology, and party identification. Methodological and political implications are discussed. "
0	Research on agrifood standards in developing countries has highlighted that the values of labor tend to be traded off against the priorities for particular food safety and quality standards. As Chile emerged as a world leader in the export of fresh fruit, their efforts to meet stringent quality standards resulted in large-scale use of pesticides becoming the norm with serious health consequences for farm workers, especially women. Within the context of weak public regulation, poor labor conditions, and low levels of organization among agricultural workers, some critics argue that standards for corporate social responsibility could improve labor conditions. This paper explores the implications of labor standards established by EUREP, an association of major UK and European supermarkets. In-depth interviews and participant observation revealed that these standards appear to reduce the risk of agrichemical exposure for permanent, male workers but not for temporary female workers. The paper argues that these standards fail to address the health and safety concerns of female laborers because they ignore how Chiles agricultural labor market is gendered. Furthermore, private retailer standards are constrained in their ability to improve welfare standards for women workers because retailer supply chain strategies reinforce gender divisions and inequities within the labor market.
1	It may be premature to think that contemporary families are egalitarian because wives are working more and fathers are more involved with children. This research contends that egalitarianism is reflected in gender similarity in missing work to attend to children's needs. Drawing from two national surveys of dual-earner parents, familial factors (especially children and spouses work hours) exceeded job-related factors in determining women's sole provision of urgent childcare. Although mend egalitarian ideology was positively associated with urgent-childcare provision, men as a whole were less likely than women to adapt their work efforts to familial demands. These findings suggest more persistent traditionalism than progress toward egalitarianism in work-family role performance. The implications of these results for future research were briefly discussed.
1	This study uses survey data for 2004 on the general public (N = 788) and public officials (N = 791) in the young post-communist democracy of Estonia to examine individual-level determinants of corruption. The results indicate that both public officials and citizens are more likely to engage in corruption when they do not define corruption as wrong, and when they perceive that corrupt behavior is widespread among their peers. This social learning effect becomes statistically insignificant for those citizens who are extorted. The results provide no support for the most common argument on corruption and compliance that people are more likely to engage in corruption when they are distrustful of their fellow citizens or of government.
0	The number of non-citizens expelled from the United States because of criminal behavior has increased dramatically during the past twenty years.  We conceptualize these criminal deportations as a distinct form of state social control  banishment  and test an explanatory model that builds on three theories of social control.  The political sociology of punishment suggests that criminal deportations will increase at times when political conservatives are in power.  Labor market theories predict reliance on deportations during periods of high unemployment, and minority group threat theory predicts more deportations when minority group size increases.  Our inquiry finds some support for each of these perspectives, as criminal deportations increase in frequency when unemployment, congressional conservatism, and Mexican immigration are high.  Those results are significant even when accounting for violent crime rates, population changes, and the size of immigrant populations.
0	Women have made remarkable progress in access to and attainment of higher education; however, gender differences in college major contribute to gender stratification in the labor market (Jacobs 1996).  This paper explores the role that college major played in the change in the sex gap in pay from the 1960s/1970s to the 1980s/1990s.  Multiple data sets  the National Longitudinal Study  Original Cohorts and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, 1979, allowed for the creation of two independent cross-sections.  The sample included young college-educated men and women who were in the labor force approximately 5 years after college.  Results showed that changes in sex differences in major explained 16-30 percent of the decrease in the sex gap in pay over time.  The gap in percent female of major declined, as did most of the gaps in broad college major categories.  Changes in sex differences in returns to major explained zero-14 percent of the change in the sex gap in pay.  Generally, changes in returns benefited men, particularly through an increase in returns to Science majors.  Integration of college majors was an important part of the decline in the wage gap from the 1960s/1970s to the 1980s/1990s among college-educated men and women in the labor force.
1	Several recent studies across the social sciences show that the spatial agglomeration of employment in a local labor market benefits both firms and workers in terms of better firm performance and higher wages. Drawing from the organizational ecology perspective, we argue that workers receive higher wages in large industrial clusters and urban labor markets because of the greater degree of organizational diversity relative to smaller local industries and labor markets. Using data from the 1990 PUMS-L, we employ a three-level hierarchical linear model in order to test hypotheses regarding organizational diversity and the effects of industrial and urban agglomeration on wages. We find that workers benefit from both forms of agglomeration due to greater establishment size and industrial diversity in large industrial clusters and urban labor markets. We also find that urban agglomeration has a larger substantive effect on wages than industrial agglomeration in reduced models, but the industrial agglomeration effect is more robust across models. These findings support the organizational ecology perspective, which suggests that workers earn higher wages in local industry clusters and urban labor markets because greater organizational diversity leads to more optimal matching between workers and employers. However, the wage premium associated with urban labor markets is also due to other factors, such as greater levels of human capital and higher rates of union density.
0	The role of culture in persistent political divisions within the United States is explored.  Specifically, the possible impact of partisan context on population change is tested using OLS regression and binary logistic regression.  To carry this out two new analytic frameworks are presented: 1) The DRM typology of partisanship, 2) Scenes Performance Scores as quantitative cultural measures.  Results indicate weak but broad support for the thesis that population change is associated with partisanship, and that culture also plays a role in the same process.  Further work is necessary to confirm these results and test more specific relationships between culture and partisanship.
0	Using a predominately Mexican-origin Latino sample of 5th grade students from the Southwest, this study examined the relative effects of perceived discrimination and acculturation stress on substance use and assessed whether these effects were moderated by linguistic acculturation or time in the U.S. Although rates of substance use were generally low in the sample, given the young age of the participants, over half (59%) of the sample perceived some discrimination, and almost half (47%) experienced some acculturation stress. Spanish dominant and bilingual youth perceived more discrimination than English dominant youth whereas youth who have been in the U.S. five or fewer years perceived more discrimination than youth with more time in the U.S. Youth who were Spanish dominant or were recent arrivals experienced the most acculturation stress, with levels declining as linguistic acculturation and time in the U.S. increased. Multiple regression estimates indicated that perceived discrimination was associated with more recent substance use amount and frequency, more lifetime substance use, and more pro-drug norms and attitudes. Although acculturation stress was not associated with substance use, it was positively associated with several pro-drug norms and attitudes. With a few exceptions, linguistic acculturation and time in the U.S. did not moderate the effects of perceived discrimination or acculturation stress.
1	This article explores how the efficiency of Internet search is changing the way Americans find romantic partners. We use a new data source, the How Couples Meet and Stay Together survey. Results show that for 60 years, family and grade school have been steadily declining in their influence over the dating market. In the past 15 years, the rise of the Internet has partly displaced not only family and school, but also neighborhood, friends, and the workplace as venues for meeting partners. The Internet increasingly allows Americans to meet and form relationships with perfect strangers, that is, people with whom they had no previous social tie. Individuals who face a thin market for potential partners, such as gays, lesbians, and middle-aged heterosexuals, are especially likely to meet partners online. One result of the increasing importance of the Internet in meeting partners is that adults with Internet access at home are substantially more likely to have partners, even after controlling for other factors. Partnership rate has increased during the Internet era (consistent with Internet efficiency of search) for same-sex couples, but the heterosexual partnership rate has been flat.
0	This paper examines how men deny, cross, stretch, and solidify boundaries of racialized masculinities as they talk about, imagine and perform dance in everyday life. It is based upon interviews and participant observation. Dance, as it is performed in everyday settings, provides a particularly useful perspective on the intersection of race and gender categories. As men dance or avoid dance they help to constitute everyday spectacles in which racialized masculinities are defined. Dance is also an activity in which racial categories appear to be easily transcended. The frequent tension between dance performance and perceived race category provides a place to examine the relationship between the trainable performing body and stubborn social structure. This paper looks at men dancing within and across the boundaries of racial categories in order to test the limits of theorizing racialized gender in performative terms.
1	"Both ""welfare culture"" arguments and structural explanations of poverty suggest that attitudes may have an effect on work and welfare outcomes. However, most scholars only examine objective behaviors and characteristics despite the fact that values are an underlying mechanism in explanations of the transmission of welfare and work behavior. Using data from a survey of recent welfare recipients in Louisiana and structural equation methods we analyze causal relationships among family background, socioeconomic characteristics, attitudes, and two outcomes-TANF participation and employment. We find some support for the intergenerational transmission of welfare but not through values; we find no evidence that under the TANF system, values inhibit work. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0	The phenomenon of instrumental drug use for modification of the body remains largely undocumented. This research addresses young women’s instrumental substance use as a tool for management of the body. Although instrumental users faced the potential for stigma, the nature of their lines of action was insulating from many negative social consequences, as women remained largely private about their behaviors. Although women were secretive about their methods to control their embodied experience, most described their behavior as an unconventional “lifestyle choice” which aided in the creation of their ideal embodied experiences. Young women hailed drugs for their instrumental utility in managing the body, and shunned popular conceptions of their behaviors as pathological. This paper addresses the role that gendered ideals played in participants’ choices concerning the “proper” representation of femininity.
1	Variance function regression models and demographic decomposition methods are applied to identify two dimensions of changes in health disparities (SES-demographic effects vs. compositional effects, between-group disparities vs. within-group disparities) in the US from 1984 to 2007. Using National Health Interview Survey data on self-reported health, we find that disparities in men's health increased, while those of women decreased, for the whole period. Widening men's health disparities are largely driven by increases in the effects of SES-demographic statuses on within-group disparities. These increases are moderated by increasing levels of men's college attainment. But decreasing middle and upper income attainment and a decreasing employment rate further increase men's health disparities. For women, the effects of SES-demographic statuses on health disparities also increased over time. This, however, was outweighed by increases in women's college attainment, middle and upper income attainment, and employment rate. The result is overall declining self-reported health disparities for women. 
1	We use Wisconsin Longitudinal Study data (n = 2,678) to assess the effects of religious denomination and ideology on end-of-life treatment preferences in two hypothetical terminal illness scenarios: physical pain and severe cognitive impairment. We found no statistically significant differences when comparing traditionally defined religious denominational groups (i.e., conservative, moderate and liberal Protestants; Catholics; other religions; no religion). However, when we considered the intersection of broad denominational group and adherence to Christian fundamentalist beliefs, we found that fundamentalist Catholics and fundamentalist Protestants were significantly more likely than their nonfundamentalist counterparts to desire life-extending treatments in both scenarios. These effects were fully explained by beliefs about quality of life and religious control over medical decisions. We end with a discussion of the study's theoretical and policy implications.

1	From 1973 to 2007, private sector union membership in the United States declined from 34 to 8 percent for men and from 16 to 6 percent for women. During this period, inequality in hourly wages increased by over 40 percent. We report a decomposition, relating rising inequality to the union wage distribution's shrinking weight. We argue that unions helped institutionalize norms of equity, reducing the dispersion of nonunion wages in highly unionized regions and industries. Accounting for unions' effect on union and nonunion wages suggests that the decline of organized labor explains a fifth to a third of the growth in inequality-an effect comparable to the growing stratification of wages by education.
1	Dealing with personnel inherited from prior regimes in the administration of transitional states is critical for democratic consolidation, a problem traditionally addressed by the dichotomy of continuation or dismissal. However, major organizational innovations to deal with tainted officials appear in postcommunist Central Europe. Using the concept of lustration systems, this study differentiates three archetypes: dismissal, exposure, and confession. The authors propose that each system carries different symbolic meanings, which produce different outcomes for citizens' trust in government and in tainted officials. The hypothesized effects of different lustration systems on trust are tested by an experiment embedded in nationwide representative surveys conducted in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. The results show that dismissal and confession increase citizens' trust in government and trust in tainted officials. However, exposure reduces citizens' trust in tainted officials.
1	This study assesses changes in sex and race disparities in health over the life course and across cohorts by conducting growth curve analyses of nationally representative longitudinal data that spans 15 years. It finds that changes in disparities in depressive symptoms, disability and self-assessments of health across the life course are cohort-related phenomena: (1. there is significant inter-cohort heterogeneity in health trajectories; (2. intra-cohort sex and race inequalities exist in levels of health but not in growth rates of all health problems; (3. there are inter-cohort variations in the intra-cohort heterogeneity - sex and race gaps change across cohorts in levels of health. Changes in the sex gap in growth rates of depression are also strongly contingent upon cohort membership.
0	Cultural theory posits that social groups possess a cultural repertoire or tool kit that reflects beliefs, ritual practices, stories, and symbols that provide meaning and impetus for resource mobilization.  The theory has recently been used in an ethnographic study to explore the relationship between Black Church culture and community action among Black residents. However, little empirical research has been forwarded relative to the relationship between longstanding Black Church cultural components  specifically, scripture, song, prayers, and sermons  and activism among Black churches. Most research has been theoretical, anecdotal, or based on qualitative findings. Using a large national sample of Black congregations across seven denominations, I test aspects of cultural theory. Findings support the consistent, direct relationship between prayer groups and gospel music and various forms of community action and less influence by spirituals and the general usage of sacred scripture.
0	In Brazil, racial classification is organized around three main categories: white, pardo (i.e., mulatto), and black. There is considerable slippage between these categories, leading some scholars to hypothesize that money whitens. Some have speculated that the social pressure to identify with lighter categories whenever possible presents an obstacle to race-based mobilization in Brazil. However, there is some evidence that there has been a recent trend towards racial mobilization that includes a push to identify as either black or white, which would suggest an increasing polarization of racial identity in Brazil. This paper tests these hypotheses by examining the individual and neighborhood characteristics associated with self-lightening and self-darkening. Self-lightening refers to a discrepancy in which the respondents racial self-classification was lighter than that reported by the interviewer, and self-darkening is the opposite. The findings are consistent with the theory that money whitens and provides partial evidence for racial identity polarization, although not necessarily as a result of political mobilization.
1	In this paper we introduce a new way to conceptualize and measure the educational resources that young people encounter as they make their way from kindergarten to high school graduation. Using recent methodological advances in group-based modeling and a unique data set, we empirically test for and identify a series of categorically distinct school characteristic trajectories. We find that these trajectories vary significantly in terms of their intercept and slope, their prevalence within the sampled population, and in the sociodemographic makeup of their constituent members. We then present an extended empirical example illustrating relationships between school characteristic trajectories and important post-secondary educational outcomes, both before and after controlling for static, single-year measures of primary and secondary school characteristics. Our results suggest that the chronology of students' exposures to different educational resources is significantly associated with college enrollment, college selectivity, and, in some instances, college completion. 
0	The status of women worldwide is still far too often one of subordination to the rule of men. Women bear the brunt of poverty, domestic and sexual violence, and have higher illiteracy rates and less education than their male counterparts. Women in Egypt face a myriad of problems and inequities, and domestic violence is one of the most serious. In Egypt today, gender oppression and discrimination is widespread, and male supremacy is the accepted norm. Such inequalities lay the foundation for domestic violence and exploitation of women. Despite successes in raising awareness and setting new standards for the treatment of women, very little has actually changed in the lives of most women in Egypt and violence remains a fact of life which is rarely, if ever, discussed. This paper summarizes our research examining the extent of domestic violence in rural Egypt, the various forms it takes, its causes, and consequences. The aim of this research is to explore the impact of Egyptian culture, and socialization, on women\'s submission to domestic violence. Only by understanding the various dimensions of the Egyptian culture that normalize violence against women, can we develop programs and interventions to empower women to refuse and resist this violence.
1	Cantor and Land (1985) developed a theoretical model that proposed two pathways through which economic activity - as indexed by the aggregate unemployment rate could affect the rate of criminal activity. The first is by increasing levels of criminal motivation within the population as deteriorating economic conditions affect social strain and social control; the second is by influencing the availability and vulnerability of criminal targets and thus the number of criminal opportunities. Although much empirical research has applied this theoretical model, few analyses have done so at disaggregated units of analysis. We present the most comprehensive analysis to date by empirically evaluating this model with data on 400 of the largest US counties - and examine the effects of aggregation on results as these county data are combined to the state and national levels - for the years 1978-2005. For seven Index crimes at each of the three levels of analysis, and with or without controls for structural covariates at each level, the directional effects hypothesized by Cantor and Land are found for 78 out of 84 estimated relationships. Even after taking into account the lack of statistical independence of these estimates by drawing on recently developed statistical theory, this is a very unlikely outcome. In accordance with expectations based on theory and prior research, (a) some of these relationships are weak and not statistically significant, and (b) the strongest and most consistent patterns of relationships for both the crime opportunity and crime motivation effects are found for three property crimes: burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Suggestions for further research on this topic are given. 
0	With an estimated 8.9 million people currently living with a diagnosis of cancer, increasing attention is being given to the needs of cancer survivors.  Following successful treatment, cancer survivors may expect to return to their pre-cancer lives.  However, because of the invasive, painful, and often disfiguring treatments for cancer and the uncertainty and fear of recurrence, it is unlikely that survivors return to their old lives.  While most cancer patients do not meet the diagnostic criteria for mental disorder, they still face powerful and prolonged mental health consequences as they grapple with the meaningsboth positive and negativeof illness.  The subjective meanings attached to ones cancer experience are important determinants of the psychological well being of cancer survivors.  Although we are beginning to understand the range of meanings attached to cancer, we lack an understanding of the process through which survivors construct meaning(s); how cultural and interactional factors enter into the meaning making process; and how this process may differ across types of cancer.  Through in-depth interviews with women who have completed treatment for cancer, this project will examine how cancer survivors make sense of cancer and incorporate the experience into the self.  By recognizing that cancer survivors face difficulties in adjusting to their illness even after successful treatment, this project broadens the scope of most studies of chronic illness and recognizes the need to study cancer (and cancer survivors) as a unique type of chronic illness.
1	The Texas legislature passed the Top 10% Law in 1996 guaranteeing automatic admission to any Texas public college or university for seniors who graduate in the top decile of their high school class. Using data on a representative sample of seniors (N = 12,029) enrolled in 96 Texas public high schools, we examine whether and how this law affects the educational aspirations and expectations of graduating seniors, as well as whether they apply to college. Hierarchical generalized linear models demonstrate that the knowledge of a percent plan has played an important role in raising the sights of students who might not otherwise consider college. This effect is particularly pronounced for minority students, although peer, family and high school context play pivotal roles.
1	"While the general dynamics governing collective memory processes are well developed theoretically, our tool kit for systematically assessing how collective memory changes over time remains limited. Here, we focus on a particular tragic event the killing of five participants in an anti-KKK march in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Nov. 3, 1979 to assess continuity and change across accounts presented as part of a 1980 federally-sponsored investigation and a 2005 truth and reconciliation commission. Specifically, we employ a block modeling methodology to describe the structure of narrative themes shared across multiple accounts in each time period. We then analyze the sources of temporal variation in these narratives, and show how shifts in the range of actors participating in the 1980 and 2005 initiatives, as well as the institutional contexts within which accounts were offered, shaped how themes were strategically deployed to increase the resonance of specific positions. We find that, in the Greensboro case, the contours of these demographic and institutional dimensions resulted in a decrease in the polarization of competing narratives and an increased emphasis on key themes that contested elite ""institutional"" accounts."
1	Research examining the determinants of fear of crime has arguably raised more questions than it has answered. This exploratory study addresses one of the compelling questions that remains unanswered: what is the role of ethnicity, both at the community and individual levels, in understanding variation in fear of crime? Guided by racial or minority group threat theory, we examine the relative sizes of both the Black and Latino populations as indicators of minority group threat to determine their role in understanding individual fear of crime in a city where Latinos represent a much larger proportion of the population than Blacks (Miami-Dade County, Florida). Furthermore, the race and ethnic backgrounds of the respondents are also considered to evaluate their role in understanding variation in the fear of crime. Using both Census tract-level data and data collected from a NIDA sponsored grant that was part of a larger study about physically disabled residents, our findings reveal that in Miami-Dade County where Blacks are highly segregated from whites, the relative size of the Latino population is a predictor of fear of crime among white residents. Implications of this finding are considered, including a call for more nuanced research focusing on the predictors of fear of crime within multiethnic communities. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

1	"Why did some social movement organization (SMO)families receive extensive media coverage? In this article, we elaborate and appraise four core arguments in the literature on movements and their consequences: disruption, resource mobilization, political partisanship, and whether a movement benefits from an enforced policy. Our fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (fsQCA) draw on new, unique data from the New York Times across the twentieth century on more than 1,200 SMOs and 34 SMO families. At the SMO family level, coverage correlates highly with common measures of the size and disruptive activity of movements, with the labor and African American civil rights movements receiving the most coverage. Addressing why some movement families experienced daily coverage, fsQCA indicates that disruption, resource mobilization, and an enforced policy are jointly sufficient; partisanship, the standard form of ""political opportunity,"" is not part of the solution. Our results support the main perspectives, while also suggesting that movement scholars may need to reexamine their ideas of favorable political contexts."
1	"This article builds on an important but underdeveloped social science concept the ""scene"" as a cluster of urban amenities-to contribute to social science theory and subspecialties such as urban and rural, class, race and gender studies Scenes grow more important in less industrial, more expressively-oriented and contingent societies where traditional constraints fall and self-motivated action mound consumption, leisure and amenities is a more important feature of social cohesiveness and interaction. Scenes contextualize the individual through amenities and consumption-based expressions of shared sensibilities as to what is right, beautiful and genuine. This framework adds to concepts such as neighborhood and workplace by specifying 15 dimensions of the urban scenescape. Like neighborhood and workplace, scenes reduce anomie, but because of their focus on consumption and the use of specific amenities, they are more consistent with today's ethos of contingency, moving beyond traditional ideas of the fundamental power of social, family and occupational background. We introduce a new amenities-focused database to measure and analyze scenes and their dimensions for each of 40,000 U.S. zip codes. We illustrate the framework by applying it to one distinct type of scene, bohemia, and analyze its position in the broader social system."
0	This paper traces key features of recent state reorganization by examining the discourse of personal responsibility permeating the American welfare and penal systems.  Existing accounts of the state focus primarily on changes in state regulation of labor markets in identifying features of neoliberal governance in the reorganization of the state.  Though feminist scholars have shown that independence has long been a goal of state policy, we argue this has been conceptualized as participation in the labor market.  In contrast, our discursive analysis of the language of personal responsibility suggests that participation in nuclear family units underpins the ability of poor women to meet the expectations of the state. Thus the family is increasingly being viewed by state actors as a means through which poor women can attain personal responsibility.  As personal responsibility has come to replace the rehabilitative ideal, therapeutic strategies have been reframed in terms of personal culpability and transformation. This has been accomplished through the devolution of state activities to non-state actors such as non-profit organizations, and especially faith-based organizations.  Changes in the both the agents and means of governance have produced an institutional framework within which the discourse linking family to personal responsibility is strengthened.
0	The past decade has been marked by an upsurge of diversity in organizational forms which diverged from traditionally dominant model of public corporations, particularly in terms of their explicit pursuit of social and environmental values in addition to profit. Nevertheless, these organizations – often called ‘social enterprises’ – have not gained sufficient academic attention thus far. This study aims to present an initial attempt to survey the general landscape of the field of social enterprises, by examining where and how these new organizations emerge. Drawing on organizational identity literature and social identity theory, I argue that social enterprises emerge through an interactive identity negotiation between organizational members and external constituencies, and therefore characteristics of external constituencies affect the degree to which organizations embrace the social identity of social enterprise. Also, I expect this process would occur through two different mechanisms, namely conformity and social change, depending on whether external expectation matches internal aspiration. These ideas were empirically tested in the context of Certified B Corporations, an organizational outcome of social enterprise certification movement. Results provided some support to theoretical argument, showing that B Corporations proliferated in industries where labor forces had higher income, industry-related social movement is active, and financial control over firms is more salient.
0	Women have made dramatic inroads into academic posts in social sciences in the pst several decades, but their entry into academic careers in chemistry and physics has lagged behind rates for social sciences. This uneven entry of women into posts in different fields has been explained in individualistic terms or as outcomes of early life experiences. In this study we examine the variable structures of careers in academic sciences across disciplinary field. We suggest that combinations of normative and structural features of academic fields influence rates of women's entry. The interplay of networks of sponsorship and mentoring, critical selection points, and timed benchmarks, in combination, create greater barriers for women in physics and chemistry than in social scientists. Normative careers as they vary by academic discipline likely are powerful, but under-researched, factors in the differential entry rates of women scientists by field.
0	Using the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), this study investigates the relationship between high school graduates’ race/ethnicity and their enrollment in American selective colleges and universities. Main questions of the study are: Is there racial/ethnic differences in overall college enrollment; 4-year vs. 2-year college enrollment; and 4-year selective vs. 4-year non-selective college enrollment? How does selective college enrollment change by race/ethnicity? What other factors mediate the race effect – if any- on selective college enrollment? The study finds that compared to whites, students of color – both Blacks and Hispanics- are more likely to have overall college enrollment rate, and are also more likely to attend 4-year colleges (relative to 2-year or less) only when controlling for their academic achievement and socio-economic background (SES). This suggests that racial inequalities in college enrollment occur largely through students’ socioeconomic background and academic achievement. However, that does not hold true when considering institutional selectivity. Relative to white students, Black and Latino students are less likely to attend selective 4-year colleges even controlling for their academic achievement and SES.
0	Based on nealy 8-month fieldwork in Beijing, this paper explores Chinese patients’ practice of guanxi in getting medical services. Patients often use two kinds of guanxi practice: searching guanxi, meaning finding out guanxi with doctors through third part; and creating guanxi, meaning transcending practitioner-patient relationship and moving it to more intimate personal relations with affection and trust. These two kinds of practice of guanxi should be understood as patients’ endeavor to overcome system barrier and trust deficiency, which are the main connotation of kanbing nan (difficult to consult doctors) in China’s context. In addition, this paper will illuminate that though such practice, to some extent, could be regarded as the resistance against problematic health care system, it is no significant to the improvement of the whole system because such resistance is highly individual and fragmental.
1	Perhaps the leading perspective on how and where prisons are located stems from the perspective of the prison industrial complex (PIC). Implicit, if not explicit, in the PIC perspective is the notion that Black and Hispanic prisoners are exploited for the benefit of poor, unemployed, White prison towns. Unfortunately, however, there has been a shortage of empirical scrutiny of this central notion. This paper examines this claim with a rare event logistic regression analysis of 176 new prison placements across 13,155 rural places in the 1990s in the US. In contrast to the PIC perspective, prison towns are disproportionately southern and poor, and have a larger population with a greater share of Blacks and Hispanics. The analysis yields three further challenges to the PIC perspective on prison towns. First, findings suggest rural prison placement does not cause racial and economic inequality as much as prison siting results from concentrated rural disadvantage. Second, there is not one prototypical prison town. Instead, there are typologies of prison towns based on US region, race, town population size, race, prior proximate prison, and SES. Lastly, future studies should consider the theoretical and methodological implications of rural concentrated disadvantage in measuring prison impact. 
1	The Hispanic population is now the largest and fastest growing minority in the United States, so it is not surprising that ethnic threat linked to Hispanics has been associated with harsher crime control. While minority threat research has found that individuals who associate blacks with crime are more likely to support harsh criminal policies, the possibility that this relationship exists for those who typify Hispanics as criminal has yet to be examined. Using a national random sample, this study is the first to use HLM to find that perceptions of Hispanics as criminals do increase support for punitive crime control measures, controlling for various individual and state influences. Moderated and contextual analyses indicate this relationship is most applicable for individuals who are less apt to typify criminals as black, less prejudiced, less fearful of victimization, politically liberal or moderate, not parents, and living in states with relatively fewer Latin American immigrants. 
1	This reserach examines wealth distribution across ethnic groups in Israel and evaluates the role of labor market rewards and intergenerational transfers in producing ethnic disparities. Israel SHARE data from 2005-2006 are used in the analyses. The findings reveal considerable ethnic disparities in wealth. Wealth disparities are most pronounced when Israeli-born Jews are compared with Arabs and with immigrants from the Former Soviet Union. Further analysis suggests that wealth buildup in Israel is influenced by two major sources: income flows and inheritance. The differential impact of the two sources on wealth disparities can be best understood when considering the unique position of each ethnic group in Israeli society.
1	"This article examines the widespread resistance to condom use in sub-Saharan Africa by describing the major semiotic axes that organize how people talk about condoms and condom use. These axes include the ""sweetness"" of sex, trust and love between sexual partners, and assessments of risk and danger Using data from rural Malawi, we show that framing the meaning of condoms as a simple choice between risky behavior and rational attempts to protect one health ignores the complex semiotic space that Malawians navigate. Based on data from more than 600 diaries that record rural Malawians' everyday conversations, our analysis charts the semiotic axes related to condom use. Semiotic constraints operate most powerfully at the level of relationships. Condom use signifies a risk-v, less serious, and less intimate partner Even when people believe that condom use is appropriate, wise, or even a matter of life and death, the statement that condom use makes about a relationship usually trumps all other meanings. We call for a more nuanced analysis of culture, one that is attentive to the ways agents navigate multiple, contested meanings, and that demonstrates how specific semiotic axes are brought to bear in particular interactional contexts."
0	Womens traversal of public space in Islamicate  societies, such as Pakistan, and the readings of the feminine/ized body within these spaces has gained currency in global and national discourses. This paper is a textual and visual study of two images of womens bodies in the public/political spaces of Pakistan and their attendant discourses.  Specifically, I engage in a close interrogation of the veiled female martyrs of the Red Mosque events of 2007 and the images of Benazir Bhutto, upon her reentry into Pakistan in 2007.  A close analysis of these two images will allow me to concentrate on three analytical ambitions: 1) the symbology of womens bodies in Pakistani public/political spaces as demonstrative of contemporary nationalism and globalization, 2) the contradictions within these discourses (Read: Pakistans relationship vis-à-vis U.S. imperial geopolitics) operating though the Pakistani female body and 3) demonstrate how women simultaneously represent nationhood and a disruption to nation because they connect the private and the public, the local and the national, the mind and the body.  This paper seek to explore the ways these two figures curiously open a sprawling discursive world of interpenetrative symbology that concurrently represent and problematize the ideals (in feminine form) associated with Pakistani nationalism. In orchestrating these two images as part of an assembly of contemporary Pakistan, I probe the way female bodies in public space eschew the hybridization of feminist narratives in Pakistan.
1	We examine the changing social and economic characteristics of women who give birth out of wedlock. Using Current Population Survey data collected between 1982 and 2002, we find that never-married mothers remain impoverished Their income growth over these years was modest despite substantial gains in education employment, and other individual characteristics generally associated with prosperity These results affirm the ongoing role of family structure in shaping American inequality 
0	Is religion declining or growing? What are the macro and micro processes at work and how do they interact to bring about religious change over time and across the life-course? How do social-historical processes and individual-psychological processes contribute to the waxing and waning of religious authority over time? A variety of theoretical perspectives are brought to bear on these questions. Three dimensions of religiosity (religious beliefs, religious participation, and civic religiosity) are illustrated as a function of time and age using a longitudinal, multi-generational dataset. Historical effects and age are isolated by comparing trajectories of differing generations across time and age. It is hypothesized that the interactions between macro and micro level mechanisms account for the growth and decline trends of religiosity over time and across the life-course. Religious beliefs seem to vary with economic trends over time, are affected by education, and show overall slow declines over time; whereas religious participation varies across the life-course and shows a slight increase over the life-course. Civic religiosity is the aspect of religiosity most affected by family structure variables. The dynamics of believing less and participating more over time and age are an example of the complex dynamics at play in understanding religious change. These findings suggest important extensions to the secularization theory of religious change.
1	The literature on assimilation and ethnic identity formation largely assumes that the durability of ethnic boundaries is a function of the assimilation measures that sociologists commonly employ. But this literature fails to account adequately for the role of immigration patterns in explaining the durability and nature of ethnic boundaries. Using 123 in-depth interviews with later-generation Mexican Americans, this article shows that Mexican immigrant replenishment shapes ethnic boundaries and ethnic identity formation. The sizable immigrant population sharpens intergroup boundaries through the indirect effects of nativism and by contributing to the continuing significance of race in the lives of later-generation Mexican Americans. The presence of a large immigrant population also creates intragroup boundaries that run through the Mexican-origin population and that are animated by expectations about ethnic authenticity. The article illustrates the importance of immigrant replenishment to processes of assimilation and ethnic identity formation.
1	"This article explores racial/ethnic differences in community knowledge as a contributing mechanism through which residential segregation in U. S. cities is perpetuated. If whites, blacks, and Latinos are familiar with different communities, and that familiarity is influenced by community racial/ethnic composition, then these ""blind spots"" may constitute one barrier to integrative mobility. We address three questions: (1) Do blacks, whites, and Latinos have different community blind spots?; (2) Do blacks, whites, and Latinos of the same social, economic, and geographic backgrounds still have different blind spots?; and (3) Do the racial/ethnic characteristics of the community predict a racial/ethnic difference in blind spots, net of the respondent's and the community's other characteristics? Employing logistic regression and hierarchical linear models with data from the 2004-2005 Chicago Area Study, we explore how whites, blacks, and Latinos differ in their knowledge of actual communities in the Chicago metropolitan area and whether differences persist after controlling for social class characteristics. Results show strong evidence that community knowledge is shaped by race-both of the resident and of the target community. Policy implications of the results are discussed."
0	The purpose of this paper is to explore perceptions of religious tensions between Latter-Day Saint (LDS) and Protestant college students. The theoretical framework incorporates similarity, contact, social distance and monopoly/minority religion hypotheses and control factors into a model. Survey and focus groups were conducted at an intermountain west university. The results suggest that both LDS and non-LDS students perceive religious tensions on campus. The LDS students view tensions as part of the proselytizing aspect of their faith while non-LDS students see tensions in terms conflicts in ideas and values. The explanation for the tensions appears to be rooted in the monopoly/minority religion argument and religious affiliation as the bases for social interaction. The fact that the two groups of students perceive the tensions differently may suggest that increasing interpersonal contact and decreasing desires for social distance may not address the tensions on campus.
0	Information technology and new media allow for the collection and sharing of personal information at unprecedented levels. This study explores how people think about privacy issues when using new interactive technologies. Based on a year-long qualitative field study, this project examines how people conceptualize privacy and surveillance when using mobile social network systems. Consistent with previous privacy research, informants indicated they were not concerned about their privacy because they felt they had control of their personal information. Nevertheless, fieldwork and interviews indicated three kinds of surveillance present in their everyday usage of the mobile social network systems: voluntary Panopticon, lateral surveillance, and self-surveillance. This study sheds light on the everyday conceptions and meanings of surveillance and interactive technology.
0	This presentation analyzes knowledge about emergency contraception among Ghanaian women. Although sub-Saharan African birth rates have declined somewhat, they still remain relatively high. Emergency contraception can assist in limiting the number of unplanned pregnancies in Ghana. Previous research concerning the topic of emergency contraception in Ghana has focused on health care providers and college students. As a result, it is difficult for policy makers to obtain an accurate assessment of emergency contraceptive use among the general population. This research project utilizes a secondary data analysis with the Ghana Demographic Health Survey (GDHS) as a component of the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) collected in 2003 and 2008. Utilizing both waves of data allows the researchers to assess knowledge of emergency contraception over time. This research project describes knowledge of emergency contraception as dependent upon key variables, such as marriage, religion, ethnicity, education, and age. These findings suggest there is an increase in the knowledge of emergency contraception from 2003 to 2008. There is also relationship between education and knowledge of emergency contraception and between age and knowledge of emergency contraception.
0	The study brings together two bodies of literature--on the consequences of labor migration for sending areas and on factors shaping union stability--and employs unique longitudinal data from rural Mozambique, a rapidly changing setting with massive yet diverse male labor out-migration, to examine the effects of men's migration on union dissolution and the role of women's decision-making autonomy in this causal relationship. The analysis detect no overall influence of husband's migration status on the likelihood of union dissolution, but the lack of overall influence conceals substantial differences in the rates of dissolution between unions of more successful and less successful migrants. While women's decision-making autonomy does not mediate the effect of migration on union dissolution, it does moderate this effect in significant and instructive ways. Implications of these results for trends in union stability in sub-Saharan and other developing settings are discussed.
1	In the context of the minority vulnerability thesis, this study assesses whether there are racial differences in the prevalence, determinants, and timing of downward mobility from managerial/executive and professional/technical occupational categories during the critical early career years. Findings from a panel study of income dynamics sample of men support theory: African Americans, compared to Whites, have a greater incidence of downward movement, face a route to downward movement that is less strongly predicted by traditional stratification-based causal factors, and experience mobility quickly. Analyses also reveal that racial gaps in downward mobility along lines enunciated by theory are greater in the private sector than the public sector. Implications of the findings for understanding evolving patterns of racial inequality in privileged occupations are discussed. 
0	The all-women roller derby revival, which has grown from one league in 2001 to over 300 today, has been driven by the do-it-yourself (DIY) ethic.  Subscribing to the motto “by the skaters, for the skaters,” the majority of roller derby leagues are owned and operated by the participants.  As a sport created by and for women, roller derby provides an alternative to male dominated sport.  The DIY ethos has played a central role in creating and sustaining this alternative.  Drawing on an ethnographic study of three roller derby leagues, I explain what the DIY ethos means in the context of roller derby.  I argue that the DIY ethos is not simply motivated by necessity; rollergirls consider it an important value of the revival.  Doing-it-themselves ensures that skaters maintain control over their athletic activity, their organizations, and the sport of roller derby as a whole.  I contend that the DIY ethic is not about individualism.  Instead, the revival is driven by the collective effort of rollergirls, which builds social bonds between skaters both locally and nationally.  I go on to show that the DIY ethic pushed women to create a sport that they control.  The emphasis on doing-it-yourself gives women opportunities to learn new skills and gain the confidence that comes from creating and sustaining organizations.  Finally, I discuss the barriers to participation that result from the DIY ethic.  Doing-it-yourself requires both financial and time commitments that present obstacles to participation for working class women, in particular.
1	Culture and politics have a close relationship, but how exactly does the cultural become the political? This article builds a theoretical framework for this question by examining Vietnamera U.S. poets' politicization of Buddhism at the expense of more effective or more easily controllable discursive resources. I find, first, that outcomes depend on whether wouldbe appropriators and legitimate owners of the appropriated resource can strike a mutually beneficial bargain. Second, whether two such distinct parties emerge depends on how tightly contexts of the appropriation process are linked. Consequently, appropriation is best understood as reciprocal exchange.
1	In transitional economies, the scale of economic enterprise and the allocation of property rights shape social structures and influence income distribution. In agrarian economies, where labor-intensive family enterprises dominate, political officials' income advantages decline rapidly relative to those of private entrepreneurs. Larger enterprises, however provide greater income opportunities for officials, especially when a government retains an ownership stake in the initial phases of reform. This article replicates the findings from an earlier study of rural China using comparable survey data from Vietnam. We find that during the first two decades of rural market reform in Vietnam and China, the scale and ownership of firms differed radically. Small family enterprises dominated rural development in Vietnam, whereas China development was dominated by larger firms, initially established by rural governments. Consequently, while cadre income advantages have kept pace with those of private entrepreneurs in China, they have declined rapidly in Vietnam.
1	A popular perception is that immigration causes higher crime rates. Yet, historical and contemporary research finds that at the individual level, immigrants are not more inclined to commit crime than the native born. Knowledge of the macro-level relationship between immigration and crime, however, is characterized by important gaps. Most notably, despite the fact that immigration is a macro-level social process that unfolds over time, longitudinal macro-level research on the immigration-crime nexus is virtually nonexistent. Moreover, while several theoretical perspectives posit sound reasons why over-time changes in immigration could result in higher or lower crime rates, we currently know little about the veracity of these arguments. To address these issues, this study investigates the longitudinal relationship between immigration and violent crime across U. S. cities and provides the first empirical assessment of theoretical perspectives that offer explanations of that relationship. Findings support the argument that immigration lowers violent crime rates by bolstering intact (two-parent) family structures.
1	"This article focuses on three Countries with distinct policies toward motherhood and work: Germany, Sweden and the United States. We analyze the length of mothers' time Out Of paid work after childbirth and the short-term career consequences for mothers. In the United States, we identify a career punishment even for short time-out periods; long time-out periods increase the risk of a downward move and reduce the chances of an upward move. In Germany, long time-out periods destabilize the career and, the longer the leave, the greater the risk of either an upward or downward move. In Sweden, we find a negative effect of time Out on upward moves. Hence, even in ""woman-friendly' Sweden, women's career prospects are better if they return to paid work sooner rather than later."
1	As women pursue careers while retaining primary responsibility for family life, discretionary time is an emerging arena of gender inequality in contemporary life. This study examines gender inequality in waking role obligations and the implications for differences in sleep disruption. Drawing on a sample of 583 retail food workers, who regularly worked nights and rotating schedules, we find in our multivariate modeling that women experience significantly more sleep disruption than do men. A decomposition analysis shows that almost one-half of the gender gap in sleep disruption is accounted for by gender differences in health status and various dimensions of work-family context. By implication, the remainder of the gender gap in sleep disruption is attributable to differences in responsibility for work-family obligations. Given the need for more research on how work-family conflict affects health and well-being, further research on sleep patterns is warranted.
1	One of the great paradoxes of institutional change is that even when top managers in organizations provide support for change in response to new regulation, the employees whom new programs are designed to benefit often do not use them. This 15-month ethnographic study of two hospitals responding to new regulation demonstrates that using these programs may require subordinate employees to challenge middle managers with opposing interests. The article argues that relational spaces-areas of isolation, interaction, and inclusion that allow middle-manager reformers and subordinate employees to develop a cross-position collective for change-are critical to the change process. These findings have implications for research on institutional change and social movements.
1	"In the last two decades classical sociology, notably Marx, has been mined for environmental insights in the attempt to surmount the ""human exemptionalism"" of post-Second World War sociology. Weber, however, has remained an enigma in this respect. This article addresses Weber's approach to the environment, including its significance for his interpretive-causal framework and his understanding of capitalism. For Weber, sociological meanings were often anchored in biophysical realities, including climate change, resource consumption, and energy scarcity, while environmental influences were refracted in complex ways within cultural reproduction. His work thus constitutes a crucial key to constructing a meaningful postexemptionalist sociology."
0	Early in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, economic status was positively associated with infection.  A key explanation was that wealthier men could afford multiple sexual partnersparticularly commercial sex workersand therefore faced greater risk of infection.  At present, economic status is generally found to be negatively associated with HIV infection, particularly among women.  It is believed that many women are motivated by poor economic conditions to engage in transactional sex for receipt of needed financial transfers.  The relationship between wealth and HIV infection is less clear for men.  On the one hand, wealth may continue to be a risk factor for men of higher economic status, who can afford to engage in transactional sex.  On the other hand, wealthy men may have greater incentives to protect themselves from HIV infection than poorer men.  Using survey data from men in urban Kisumu, Kenya, where HIV prevalence is estimated at 30%, we examine the relationship between mens wealth and risk behavior.  We find that economic status is positively associated with engaging in transactional sex, as expected.  Economic status is not correlated with condom use, however.  Much of this analysis is concerned with exploring alternative explanations for this interesting finding.
0	This paper examines the evolving connections between local departmental ecologies and knowledge production in an interdisciplinary field in the social sciences and humanities - women’s and gender studies programs in the U.S.  Data are historical records from four women’s and gender studies departments in the U.S. and semi-structured interviews with affiliated professors.  In their formative years in the 1970s women’s studies programs were relatively homogenous in content and structure.  Scholars across sites defined the purpose of women’s studies similarly: to address the lack of research on women and analyze social problems affecting women.  Gradually scholars incorporated a broad range of analytic categories in women’s studies’ agenda, including gender identities, masculinities, and sexualities, but because the process of expansion was uneven, scholars across programs adopted diverse understandings of the priorities of research on women and gender.  I attribute this differentiation to the “suppleness” or definitional pliability of the analytical categories “women” and “gender.”  The article melds work in science studies on knowledge ecologies with studies of the development of academic disciplines as organizational forms, to understand how departmental conditions affected differences in the conception of research on gender across universities in the U.S.
0	This article examines Puerto Rican physicians status and ambitions. Under Spanish colonialism, elite Puerto Rican physicians professional identity included a struggle for a broader political autonomy. After the Spanish-American War of 1898, under U.S. colonial rule, they based their claims for greater professional autonomy on ethnic difference. This paper argues that elite Puerto Rican physicians lost their relative autonomy from the state, were politically distanced from potential patients, and were immersed in unpopular public health interventions under U.S. colonial rule. As a result, elite Puerto Rican physicians turn to professionalization and market closure was linked to nationalist politics.
1	This study examines the gender difference in educational expectations among black, white, and Hispanic high school seniors in 1972 and 1992. We link gender-related changes in expectations to students' perceived parental encouragement for higher education and access to college-preparatory coursework, and then examine the influence of expectations on subsequent educational attainments. In contrast to 1972, girls in 1992 perceived their parents to be equally or more encouraging of their pursuit of higher education than did boys, and girls were more likely to be enrolled in college preparatory coursework. The changes were most dramatic among white students, and the rise in expectations among high school girls independently contributes to their recent advances in higher education.

1	The development of conceptual frameworks for the analysis of social exclusion has somewhat out-stripped related methodological developments. This paper seeks to contribute to filling this gap through the application of self-organising maps (SOMs) to the analysis of a detailed set of material deprivation indicators relating to the Irish case. The SOM approach allows us to offer a differentiated and interpretable picture of the structure of multiple deprivation in contemporary Ireland. Employing this approach, we identify 16 clusters characterised by distinct profiles across 42 deprivation indicators. Exploratory analyses demonstrate that, controlling for equivalised household income, SOM cluster membership adds substantially to our ability to predict subjective economic stress. Moreover, in comparison with an analogous latent class approach, the SOM analysis offers considerable additional discriminatory power in relation to individuals' experience of their economic circumstances. The results suggest that the SOM approach could prove a valuable addition to a 'methodological platform' for analysing the shape and form of social exclusion. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1	Today, boys generally underperform relative to girls in schools throughout the industrialized world. Building on theories about gender identity and reports from prior ethnographic classroom observations, we argue that school environment channels conceptions of masculinity in peer culture, fostering or inhibiting boys' development of anti-school attitudes and behavior. Girls' peer groups, by contrast, vary less strongly with the social environment in the extent to which school engagement is stigmatized as un-feminine. As a consequence, boys are more sensitive than girls to school resources that create a learning-oriented environment. To evaluate this argument, we use a quasi-experimental research design and estimate the gender difference in the causal effect of peer socioeconomic status (SES) as an important school resource on test scores. Our design is based on the assumption that assignment to 5th-grade classrooms within Berlin's schools is as good as random, and we evaluate this selection process with an examination of Berlin's school regulations, a simulation analysis, and qualitative interviews with school principals. Estimates of the effect of SES composition on male and female performance strongly support our central hypothesis, and other analyses support our proposed mechanism as the likely explanation for gender differences in the causal effect.
0	Research has shown elevated rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems in Detroit, Michigan compared to state and national averages. Using 47 in-depth interviews of African American residents in two Detroit neighborhoods, this dissertation examines the challenges participants face and the strategies they devise to get physical activity. I explore the interplay between agency, social structure and community context. Interviewees discussed numerous barriers to physical activity, including concerns about crime, deteriorating sidewalks and parks, and shortcomings with local recreational facilities. Strategies to address these issues included devising home exercise regimens, and sharing equipment and other resources within social networks. Overall, the potential to enact strategies varied, in part, according to community contextual factors, such as the availability of resources within neighborhoods and in surrounding areas. After exploring these barriers and strategies, I compare scholarly understandings of health behaviors with the lived experiences of participants. Many obtained significant amounts of physical activity from walking for transportation, employment, childcare and other forms physical labor, suggesting that the focus of health scholars on “leisure-time” physical activity in studies of low-income populations may be misguided. Improvements to structural factors, neighborhoods and health policies are necessary but insufficient steps toward improving exercise behaviors. The importance of agency, social context, and the variation within and between communities suggests a theoretical framework that avoids both individualism and causal determinism. Structural improvements and health interventions must connect with the daily realities and potential of the individuals that they target.
0	With the rapid increase of old Chinese, it is essential to take a close look of their lives. From the mental health perspective, this paper is to explore (a) whether more highly educated elderly Chinese have lower levels of psychological distress than their poorly educated counterparts, and (b) whether the more healthy lifestyles due to higher education can help to explain this pattern if it exists. By applying Structural Equation Modeling, this research (1) finds that when controlling for age, gender, marital status, or rural/urban differences, more educated people indeed have lower levels of psychological distress; (2) identifies the indirect effects of education on psychological distress. And the major mediators through which education alleviates distress include (i) healthy lifestyle indicated by exercise, and (ii) life quality indicated by watching T.V., eating eggs, and playing mahjong and some other card games. These findings contribute to the literature by supporting the accumulative, at least, persistent effects of education on distress in late lives and in non-Western country.
1	"This article draws upon 134 in-depth interviews with activists and journalists in an effort to reconcile the extensive activism taking place in the shadows of presidential campaigns with its near invisibility in the news. In his classic work, Todd Gitlin (1980) demonstrated that activists become newsworthy only by submitting to the ""implicit rules of news making"" (p. 3). This research supports his finding, but demonstrates that unbeknownst to activists, coverage of political outsiders is governed by a set of rules quite different from (and often diametrically opposed to) those employed in routine news-gathering. Taking cues from news creation practices that go on daily between journalists, parajournalists, and subjects, activist groups work assiduously to prepare members to fit the needs of political reporters. They bend over backwards to be media-friendly, which they perceive as professional, quotable, and credible, but ironically these studied attempts to conform to the norms of routine political reporting make them less appealing to journalists. While journalists may attend eagerly to elected officials' press conferences and official statements, they demand authenticity, particularly in the form of emotion and spontaneity, from outsiders-the very attributes activists work to erase in their media trainings. In the end, the activist groups fail to obtain coverage, not because they can't conform to the rules of news making, but because they are following the wrong rules. This article maps the contradictory sets of norms at play in the negotiation over news, and shows how they work together to create nearly insurmountable cultural boundaries for political outsiders. Keywords: news, journalists, presidential campaigns, voluntary associations, social movement organizations."
0	Compared to studies of inner-city youths, studies of middle-class suburban youths focus on nuclear families and peer relations, thus paying less systematic attention to the roles that space plays in their lives. Based on ongoing fieldwork and short surveys in a planned suburb in Southern California, I explore the impact the organization of public space has on the daily activities among adolescents. Preliminary findings suggest that the nature of public space in the community is both controlling and protective toward adolescents. The paper also explores the tactics employed by the teens to counter such nature of the physical environment.
1	This article examines how educational disparities in mortality emerge, grow, decline, and disappear across causes of death in the United States, and how these changes contribute to the enduring association between education and mortality over time. Focusing on adults age 40 to 64 years, we first examine the extent to which educational disparities in mortality persisted from 1989 to 2007. We then test the fundamental cause prediction that educational disparities in mortality persist, in part, by shifting to new health outcomes over time. We focus on the period from 1999 to 2007, when all causes of death were coded to the same classification system. Results indicate (1) substantial widening and narrowing of educational disparities in mortality across causes of death, (2) almost all causes of death with increasing mortality rates also had widening educational disparities, and (3) the total educational disparity in mortality would be about 25 percent smaller today if not for newly emergent and growing educational disparities since 1999. These results point to the theoretical and policy importance of identifying social forces that cause health disparities to widen over time.
1	Fischer (2009) argues that our estimates of confidant network size in the 2004 General Social Survey (GSS), and therefore the trend in confidant network size from 1985 to 2004, are implausible because they are (1) inconsistent with other data and (2) contain internal anomalies that call the data into question. In this note, we assess the evidence for a decrease in confidant network size from 1985 to 2004 in the GSS data. We conclude that any plausible modeling of the data shows a decided trend downward in confidant network size from 1985 to 2004. The features that Fischer calls anomalies are exactly the characteristics described by our models (Table 5) in the original article.
1	Using structural equation modeling we examined the determinants of family emotional climate and its long-term impact on children's academic achievement and classroom behavior at the end of 5th grade. We employed the ECLS-K data a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. elementary school students. Family emotional climate was measured in the spring of kindergarten and included three dimensions: parental depression, parental warmth, and use of physical discipline. Main findings: low SES, Black and single parents were more likely to report depressive symptoms. Black parents were more likely to use physical discipline, but they also reported greater parental warmth. Asian parents were less likely to use physical discipline, but also were less likely to express parental warmth. Parental depression was associated with increased use of physical discipline and reduced parental warmth. Parental depression, measured in kindergarten, was associated with lower reading and math achievement and lower approaches to learning at the end of 5th grade. Use of physical discipline in kindergarten was associated with lower 5th-grade math achievement.

This paper examines the prevalence of cheating in a recreational sports arena: adult softball.  Cheating in adult recreational softball takes the form of altering one's bat to increase hitting power and the speed at which the ball flies off the bat when struck.  Through an online survey available to participants across the country, self-report rates of cheating are assessed as well as attitudes towards cheating.  The role of others (teammates) in promoting cheating behavior is also considered.  Results from this study indicate that 27% of respondents admitted to using an altered bat during play.  Deviance theories are used to shed light on the factors that influence such cheating including differential associations (teammates promoting cheating behavior) and social strains (resulting from the perceived disadvantage faced by noncheaters).
0	I explore the role of trade in the development of capitalism by looking at the effects of the East Indies trade on economic development in England and the rise of capitalism. I argue that the importance of the English East Indies trade lies in the fact that it played a significant role in the economic development of England and in the historically-contingent institutionalization of capitalism, which was itself a historically-embedded explanation of economic growth. The argument proceeds in three stages. The local autonomy granted to English traders in the East allowed expansion of overseas trade past the limitations imposed by the organization of other firms and partnerships. The expansion of the EIC overseas trade put the English into a position of global economic and political hegemony at the onset of the industrial revolution. The expansion of overseas trade was linked in the minds of contemporaries to economic and political expansion. In order to pursue further economic and political expansion Britain promoted overseas trade. In order to promote the expansion of trade, the British government began to use its political power to export a capitalist ideology to non-European countries.
0	How children’s schools are organized influences how much they will learn, as well as chances for high school graduation, college attendance, and,  places in the United States stratification system in the 21st century.  A major factor in minority and low income children’s learning is whether they attend schools that are integrated on social class.  School organization is at largely driven by local student assignment policies, and changes in these policies have implications for the well-being of both children and their larger communities.  Some districts, previously voluntarily and successfully integrated, are now at risk for re-segregation.  We present results from a multi-method case study of one such community, Wake County (Raleigh) NC.  We study the role of race and class in influencing citizen values that underlie attitudes towards public school assignment policies.  We take into account how variation in citizen social capital may influence these values.  Our findings suggest that the groups who favor neighborhood schools and diversity are not as sharply differentiated as some simplistic notions would imply.  In addition, we demonstrate that educational policy that might at first seem oriented around diversity and neighborhood schools also taps into other critical dimensions of citizen values.
1	This article evaluates social movement perspectives on repression and movement-countermovement organization relative to the wave of policy setbacks that unions experienced in the pivotal two decades following the New Deal. An event history analysis of the adoption of right-to-work laws across states between 1944 and 1960 supports social movement perspectives that emphasize the relative threat posed by challenging groups, but the impact of threat is uneven. The findings advance a more contextualized and historically grounded understanding, demonstrating how union threat takes on greater meaning in contexts where authorities side with employers relative to labor. This study improves upon prior labor scholarship by including data on both union and employer organization, each of which are shown to be influential for right-to-work outcomes independent of notable political opportunities. I conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for scholarship on labor and social movements more generally.
0	In this paper, we investigated: (1) the influences of socioeconomic and social risk factors on diabetes prevalence; (2) whether these factors also predict diabetes incidence; (3) the contribution of the effects of health behaviors to the prediction of incident diabetes; (4) the extent to which the effects of health behaviors mediate the effects of socioeconomic and social risk factors on incident diabetes; and (5) whether these effects differ for middle-aged and older adults. We examined these questions using nationally-representative data from the 1992-1998 panels of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for 8,439 middle-aged adults and 6,005 older adults. The HRS data show that there are major differences in diabetes prevalence that are related to age, sex, race-ethnicity, and parental socioeconomic background (as measured by parental education) as well as current education and economic resources. Those patterns are revealed for both middle-aged and older adults. Generally, the same factors are linked to the incidence of diabetes although the effects are weaker. Finally, we find that protective health behaviors predict decreased incident diabetes and that these effects operate independently of sex, race-ethnicity, and social risk factors.
1	This study explores how racial composition, in-migration and community identity influence the distribution Of antiblack and antiwhite hate crimes. Drawing on six years of Chicago Police Department reports, two decades of census data and community survey data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, the paper evaluates hypotheses derived from racial threat, macrostructural opportunity and defended community perspectives. Negative binomial models controlling for spatial dependence reveal different patterns for antiblack and antiwhite hate crimes across Chicago communities. Consistent with a defended communities model, antiblack hate crimes are most common in homogenous white communities with strong community identities undergoing recent black in-migration. In contrast, antiwhite hate crimes are most numerous in communities where blacks and whites comprise near equal proportions, supporting macrostructural opportunity perspectives.
0	We use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) to develop hazards models of high school dropout.  Our particular interest involves the place of career and technical education (CTE) within the broader landscape of the high school curriculum and individuals' experiences.  We ask whether various aspects of CTE -- which are sometimes intentionally integrated with core academic experiences and sometimes not -- increase or decrease the risk of dropping out (possibly through mechanisms of detachment from or attachment to school).  A significant reduction in the risk of dropping out is found to be associated with participating in a Career Major (a coherent sequence of courses based upon an occupational goal).  Implications and directions for future analyses are discussed.
1	The welfare state promises to moderate the duration and concentration of poverty. The authors ask how well this promise has been fulfilled in the United States and Britain from 1993 to 2003. They examine two aspects of poverty vulnerability during this period of welfare reform: (1) its persistence and associated risk factors and (2) the efficacy of social transfers. After accounting for measurement error, sociodemographic characteristics, and the impact of redistributive programs, the authors find that poverty is often persistent and risk is concentrated, especially in the United States. Moreover, the British safety net appears to better protect those at risk.
0	As a quick-fix strategy many states have courted the casino industry as a solution to ameliorate revenue shortages.  Viewed as a lucrative tax opportunity for states struggling with budget deficits the casino industry has proliferated a great deal in the last two decades.  In 2004 Pennsylvania legalized slots gambling and in 2006 the state designated 14 locations throughout the state to house the casino industry.  Two such locations have been designated in Philadelphia.  This proposal discusses the ongoing battle in Philadelphia between casino advocates and their opponents.  Sighting failures in government transparency and closed door negotiations between government and casino representatives, opponents to casinos in Philadelphia have mounted against the powerful actors who have shaped the casino agenda.  Drawing on growth machine and spatial production theories of urban sociology and the work of Steven Lukes three dimensional view of power this research will focus on how anti casino activists attempt to reshape the narratives surrounding casino development in order to wrestle power away from actors and institutions who have structured the debate.  A main investigative point of this research will be to understand how developmental narratives are structured, framed and ultimately defeated.  Drawing on Henri Lefebvre’s Right to the city thesis I will explore the ways in which anti casino activists are fighting to reclaim decision making power and control over their communities.
1	While political opportunity structure theory details how social movement organization (SMO) campaigns focus on the state and political processes, a shift toward neoliberal policies prompts those actors to target corporations directly in order to achieve their goals. This shift creates new challenges for social movements. Unlike the state, corporations are not guided by a democratic ethos, which limits movement organizations' access to decision makers. To achieve access, challenging groups often adopt institutionalized structures and tactics, which can also increase the risk of co-optation. Despite previous research, both the process of co-optation and the distinction between co-optation and other movement outcomes remain unclear. Here, applying event structure analysis to a specific case separates these outcomes: the international campaign the environmental organization Greenpeace waged to change Coca-Cola's refrigeration practices between 1998 and 2005. This analysis suggests that framing is an important strategy for SMOs to utilize, but may not be effective unless frames are backed by action. The combination of framing, institutional tactics, and noninstitutional tactics may be most effective in movement-firm interactions. Overall, this analysis contributes to a broader understanding of social movement tactics, outcomes, and framing in an age of increased corporate power. Keywords: framing, co-optation, corporate campaign, neoliberalism, event structure analysis.
0	Although it is widely accepted that some sort of macro  micro integration is pertinent for the sociological analysis, it is still part of the debate which theories should be integrated and how this integration should take place. Two possible answers to this last question are that: a) it should consider two opposing in the macro  micro continuum theories and use them in a unified manner to explain social reality, or; b) a specific theory should be develop that presents an answer to this debate. This paper will try to make a contribution to the first argument by intersecting Wallersteins perspective of the world system, understood as an approach formulated in Marxist terms that looks at the world economy, capital accumulation, including the capital-labor relationship, and worldwide interstate relations as driving forces of historical development (Munch, 1994: 94); with Schützs theory of the life-world defined as an intersubjective world in which people both create social reality and are constrained by the preexisting social and cultural structures created by their predecessors (Ritzer, 2000: 212). The intersection of these two theories will allow me to develop a theoretical integration between world-systems and life-world theories that provides with a conceptual and methodological alternative to study the process of migration and migration flows considering different approaches and levels of analysis.
1	"Primordialist and constructivist authors have debated the nature of ethnicity ""as such"" and therefore failed to explain why its characteristics vary so dramatically across cases, displaying different degrees of social closure, political salience, cultural distinctiveness, and historical stability. The author introduces a multilevel process theory to understand how these characteristics are generated and transformed over time. The theory assumes that ethnic boundaries are the outcome of the classificatory struggles and negotiations between actors situated in a social field. Three characteristics of a field - the institutional order, distribution of power, and political networks determine which actors will adopt which strategy of ethnic boundary making. The author then discusses the conditions under which these negotiations will lead to a shared understanding of the location and meaning of boundaries. The nature of this consensus explains the particular characteristics of an ethnic boundary. A final section identifies endogenous and exogenous mechanisms of change."
1	Do regime change and market reform disrupt patterns of intergenerational mobility? China's political trajectory is distinctive from that of other communist regimes in two ways. During its first three decades, the regime enforced unusually restrictive barriers to elite status inheritance. And during the subsequent market transition, unlike most of its counterparts, the Communist Party survived intact. Data from a multigeneration survey suggest that despite their obvious exclusion from the party and related administrative careers in the Mao era, certain prerevolution elites transmitted one type of elite status to their offspring to a surprising degree. Party elites, in contrast, were hit hard by radical Maoism but recovered quickly afterward, and their offspring inherited elite status at much higher rates.
1	This paper makes two empirical contributions to the literature on the putative effect of voluntary associations on economic activity. First, using a longitudinal database covering the entire United States, we differentiate between the effect of voluntary associations that are connected to other voluntary associations through the multiple membership of their members and voluntary associations that lack these ties. Second, we test for the existence of a conditional effect of the areal size of the spatial units under consideration, comparing results at the local community and the state level of analyses. We find that connected voluntary associations have a positive effect on the number of manufacturing establishments whereas isolated voluntary associations either have a negative effect or do not have any effect. Both local community and state level analyses reveal this pattern but the effects are stronger when the spatial unit of analysis is the local community. 
0	How does a history of competition between two economic actors affect their willingness and ability to work together for mutual benefit? Theory and research disagree in their answers to this question. Some students of economy believe that economic competition and cooperation are polar opposites and, consequently, competition between firms should hinder cooperation between them. The competitive embeddedness hypothesis, on the contrary, postulates that the likelihood of cooperation between two firms is significantly and positively related to the intensity of competition between these firms in the preceding period. The mechanism leading to this outcome is familiarity and knowledge-based trust, both of which are greater between competitors than between non-competitors or two randomly selected actors. The studies in the social interdependence tradition offer mixed predictions and results. My analysis of investment syndicates in venture capital industry supports the competitive embeddedness hypothesis.
0	In the U.S., existing carbon regulation strategies commonly enact mild reforms of market mechanisms as the means of pursuing mitigation goals.  In response, a climate skeptics movement has organized staunch opposition effective enough to stall the diffusion of federal regulations on energy market carbon externalities, while others question the adequacy of carbon trading as a means of mitigation or innovation.  Trying to understand where support for these positions comes from requires an examination of the political grammar invoked by various causes.  Examining the discourse surrounding carbon regulation reveals competing definitions of carbon crucial for political narratives.  Conceptualizing how carbon is differentially qualified provides a first step towards understanding how political positions are solidified in contexts defined by the uncertainty climate change presents.
0	In the United States, identified as “the world’s most religiously diverse nation” (Eck 2002), religious identity has the power to shape vastly different kinds of lifestyles and ways of navigating the social world.  Though historically, sociology of religion has focused mainly on understanding adult religiosity, recent work argues that adolescents experience religious identity formation in ways that can both help us to understand how adults achieve identities and how adolescents experience religion in their own right.  Such work locates religious identity as an outcome of multiple socialization processes, resulting in tangible behaviors and practices.  Complicating the issue are the nation’s religious minorities, whose outcomes can not always be measured using the same tools as their Christian counterparts.  In this paper, I draw from an ethnographic framework to examine identity development in Jewish and Islamic middle schools.  Using data from schools’ graduation ceremonies, I argue that the construction of an identity narrative itself is the primary intended outcome of religious education in this setting, altering how we conceptualize “successful” religious education.
0	An individual's marshaling of status cues in task situations represents one aspect of self-presentation and serves as a basis from which individuals express, and others interpret, claims to be able to contribute to the group’s success (Berger et al. 1977, 1986).  We integrate existing theories of competence-based and dominance-based legitimation into the framework and function of strong and weak status cue gestalts (Fi&#351;ek, Berger, and Norman 2005), as well as offer and validate a new unobtrusive non-verbal vocal measure of internalized status and collective validation. We present data from a mock organizational study that manipulated authority, legitimacy (authorization), and gender composition while measuring vocal adaptation. Our focus on vocal adaptation at the fundamental frequency (F0) of speech, also called the first harmonic frequency as it refers to the highest common factor of a periodic waveform, builds on recent work by Gregory and Gallagher (2002) that identifies the bandwidth of F0 between 0.0 kHz and 0.5 kHz as important to processes involving social status, influence, and compliance. We find that individuals adapt their F0 patterns towards those of higher status group members.
0	This research examines the relationship between green criminology and political economic theories of ecological disorganization to advance the study of environmental crime. Specifically, this research suggests that green criminology can benefit by drawing upon the established theory of environmental disorganization, entitled treadmill of production (ToP), which was developed by Schnaiberg in the late 1970s. The purpose of this work is to describe ToP theory and organize green criminology according to three major components in that theory. First, we examine how ecological withdrawals can organize and advance green criminology. This section of the paper draws upon previous criminological research in the coal industry. Second, we examine how ecological additions, in the form of chemical pollution, can help to organize green criminology. Finally, we conclude by examining the concept of environmental justice within green criminology. As noted in the manuscript, criminologists have neglected issues of race and class when examining environmental crimes. Fortunately, treadmill of production theory offers unique insights into the connection between the political economy and environmental injustice.
0	Researchers who study childrens expected gender roles rarely ask whether they have different expectations for different points in the life course.  In this paper, I find that many adolescents from a sample of predominantly two-parent, dual-earner families expect different levels of maternal employment in their future marriages when children are younger than when they are older.  Latent class analysis reveals four distinct mental pictures of the maternal employment career: these are labeled quick return, gradual return, homemaker, and permanent part-time.  Adolescents mothers work histories predict the kind of expectations they have, but this is not the only predictive parental characteristic.  Fathers participation in housework tends to make children expect more maternal employment, and a challenging home environment has opposite effects depending on the childs gender.
0	This article critiques neoliberal transition theory from a state-centered perspective. Neoliberal scholars have used cross-national regression analysis to argue that postcommunist economic failure is the result of inadequate adherence to neoliberal precepts. Sociologists, in turn, have relied on case study data to show that postcommunist economic failure is the outcome of too close adherence to neoliberal policy recommendations, which has led to an erosion of state effectiveness, and thus produced underdevelopment. The present paper advances a version of this statist theory based on a quantitative analysis of mass privatization programs in the postcommunist world. We argue that the neoliberal policy of rapid large-scale privatization creates severe supply and demand shocks for enterprises, thereby inducing firm failure. The resulting erosion of tax revenues leads to a fiscal crisis for the state, and severely weakens its capacity and bureaucratic character. This, in turn, reacts back on the enterprise sector, as the state can no longer support the institutions necessary for the effective functioning of a capitalist economy, thus resulting in de-modernization. In this paper, we test the predictions of neoliberal transition theory against those of our statist theory, using cross-national regression techniques. We find that the implementation of mass privatization programs negatively impacts measures of economic growth, state capacity and the security of property rights.
1	Entrepreneurial groups face a twinned challenge: recognizing and implementing new ideas. We argue that entrepreneurship is less about importing ideas than about generating new knowledge by recombining resources. In contrast to the brokerage-plus-closure perspective, we address the overlapping of cohesive group structures. In analyzing the network processes of intercohesion, we identify a distinctive network topology: the structural fold. Actors at the structural fold are multiple insiders, facilitating familiar access to diverse resources. Our data set records personnel ties among the largest 1,696 Hungarian enterprises from 1987 to 2001. First, we test whether structural folding contributes to group performance. Second, because entrepreneurship is a process of generative disruption, we test the contribution of structural folds to group instability. Third, we move from dynamic methods to historical network analysis and demonstrate that coherence is a property of interwoven lineages of cohesion, built up through repeated separation and reunification.
1	This article offers a comprehensive empirical analysis of the determinants of social movement mobilization, with serious consideration of countermovement leadership and infrastructure on terms comparable with those of the movement. The authors examine the role of resources, infrastructure, and leadership in tenant mobilization in the Los Angeles tenants' rights movement between 1976 and 1979. Using survey and census data along with archival materials, they compare neighborhoods across Los Angeles and find a significant role for resources, infrastructure, and leadership; notably, the authors find that countermovement infrastructure and leadership are more important to renter mobilization than movement infrastructure and leadership.
0	The role of parents in creating and maintaining advantage remains an important topic in uncovering home-based factors which contribute to achievement gaps.  Lareau (2002, 2003)’s ethnographic research involving families of different class and racial backgrounds identified concerted cultivation as one contributing mechanism that stems from class differences in home environments and parenting behaviors. Several researchers have since sought to confirm Lareau’s findings through the use of nationally-representative data (Bodovski and Farkas 2008; Cheadle 2008). Existing quantitative research has taken as a given that concerted cultivation should have a uniform effect among high- and low-performing students.  However, it seems plausible that concerted cultivation may have different effects across the achievement distribution. This study extends previous work by employing distributional methods to examine the hypotheses and conclusions of Lareau (2002, 2003), finding that the effects of concerted cultivation vary substantially across the distribution and are particularly important for high achievers.
1	"Much research on the ""digital divide"" presumes that adults who do not use the Internet are economically disadvantaged, yet little research has tested this premise. After discussing several mechanisms that might produce differences in earnings growth between workers who do and do not use the Internet, we use data from the Current Population Survey to examine the impact of Internet use on changes in earnings over 13-month intervals at the end of the ""Internet boom."" Our analyses reveal robustly signficant positive associations between Web use and earnings growth, indicating that some skills and behaviors associated with Internet use were rewarded by the labor market. Consistent with human-capital theory, current use at work had the strongest effect on earnings. In contrast to economic theory (which has led economists to focus exclusively on effects of contemporaneous workplace technology use), workers who used the Internet only at home also did better suggesting that users may have benefited from superior access to job information or from signaling effects of using a fashionable technology. The positive association between computer use and earnings appears to reflect the effect of Internet use, rather than use of computers for offline tasks. These results suggest that inequality in access to and mastery of technology is a valid concern for students of social stratification."
1	We investigate the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents through a comparison of the size and composition of the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents with single-race adolescents. We consider three hypotheses suggested by the literature on multiraciality and interracial friendships: (1) that multiracial adolescents have smaller friendship networks than single-race adolescents because they are more often rejected by their single-race peers, (2) that multiracial adolescents form more racially diverse friendship networks than single-race adolescents, and (3) that multiracial adolescents are especially likely to bridge (or socially connect) friendships among members of their single-race heritage background groups. Using data on adolescent friendship networks from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we find that multiracial adolescents are as popular as non-white adolescents and have social networks that are as racially diverse as the single-race groups with the most diverse friendship networks. Biracial adolescents with black ancestry have an especially high rate of friendship bridging between black persons and persons of other races, relative to black or white adolescents. The results hold using both self-identified and parental race definitions. 
0	More and more companies in corporate America promote diversity initiatives and programs as the key to their organizational success. This paper has a two fold purpose: to explore the role of unions in promoting gender and diversity in their ranks (internal diversity) and at the workplace (external diversity). The paper notices the limited literature on the topic of diversity and the union, a literature that is centered on the aspect of gender and racial diversity, while other types of diversity (e.g. part-time versus full-time workers, temporary versus permanent workers, sexual orientation etc.) are entirely neglected. The article compares briefly the role of unions in promoting workplace diversity in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia, and it also suggests new directions of research. The inclusion of diversity as a fundamental topic on unions agenda is predicted as possible means of revitalizing unions success in the US, of developing more co-operational relationships between unions and employers and of turning the potential of diversity in a source of competitive advantage for companies.
0	Research on drug markets indicates that they are not randomly distributed, but rather are concentrated around particular types of locales like alcohol outlets, homeless shelters, and drug-treatment centers.  In the current study, we contribute to this literature by developing and testing a routine activities argument outlining how and why drug markets are likely to form near schools.  In addition to making a general contribution to the literature on place and crime, this research is also important to consider regarding the issue of adolescent drug abuse, given that prior suggests that schools facilitate access to illicit drugs.  Using data from Albuquerque, New Mexico, we find that neighborhoods with middle schools and high schools experience more narcotics crime than neighborhoods without middle or high schools.  Moreover, we find that the relationship between school presence and narcotics crime is strongest during the hours directly before, during, and after school.  These results, which are consistent with hypotheses derived from the routine activities perspective, suggest that drug markets emerge around schools and that schools are an important type of place to consider when developing drug policy.
1	"In the study of civil society, Tocqueville-inspired research has helped illuminate important connections between associations and democracy, while corporatism has provided a robust framework for understanding officially approved civil society organizations in authoritarian regimes. Yet neither approach accounts for the experiences of ostensibly illegal grassroots nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in an authoritarian state. Drawing on fieldwork in China, I argue that grassroots NGOs can survive in an authoritarian regime when the state is fragmented and when censorship keeps information local. Moreover, grassroots NGOs survive only insofar as they refrain from democratic claims-making and address social needs that might fuel grievances against the state. For its part, the state tolerates such groups as long as particular state agents can claim credit for any good works while avoiding blame for any problems. Grassroots NGOs and an authoritarian state can thus coexist in a ""contingent symbiosis"" that-far from pointing to an inevitable democratization-allows ostensibly illegal groups to operate openly while relieving the state of some of its social welfare obligations."
1	Although the suicide rate among US. Youth between the ages of 10 to 24 dramatically increased during the past 50 years, little research has examined this outcome within larger social contexts of the adolescent environment. Relying on Durkheim's theory of social integration, we examine the effect of individual- and structural-level social integration on adolescents' suicidality. Using a sample of 6,369 respondents within 314 neighborhoods, we examine the assumptions that high levels of religious, familial, neighborhood, and school integration are associated with fewer suicide attempts among youths. We find support for the traditional Durkheimian assumptions; specifically, the proportion of religiously conservative residents in a neighborhood reduces youths' risk of attempting suicide, as do individual-level controls of school and parental attachment. Moreover; we find evidence for a cross-level interaction between depression and neighborhood level of religiosity. Depression increases youths' risk of attempting suicide, but in places where religion is very important, this positive effect of depression is diminished.
1	"E-mail excludes the multiple nonlinguistic cues and gestures that facilitate face-to-face communication. How, then, should interaction in a text-based context be understood? The authors analyze the problems and solutions experienced by a research panel that communicated over e-mail and face-to-face for 18 months, evaluating both kinds of exchanges alongside survey and interview data. Semiotic and linguistic theory is used to expose essential properties associated with the successful communication of meaning in each context. The authors find that e-mail requires the cultivation of new techniques for specifically conveying the ""pragmatic information"" that connects the meaning of words to their users. Such information is assigned in e-mail through the use of what are termed emphatic, referential, and characterizing semiotic tactics. These tactics are also evident in sustained online interactions studied by other researchers. This theoretical vocabulary represents an alternative to the dominant sociological characterization of e-mail as an inferior substitute for face-to-face interaction."
1	This study uses a factorial vignette design embedded in an Internet survey to investigate attitudes toward an adult child and parent living together in response to economic hardship. Over half of Americans said the desirability of intergenerational co-residence depends on particularistic aspects of the family, notably the quality of family relationships. Support for co-residence is greatest when the adult child is single rather than partnered. Support is weaker if the adult child is cohabiting rather than married to the partner, although groups with greater exposure to cohabitation make less of a distinction between cohabitation and marriage. Presence of a grandchild does not affect views about co-residence. There is more support for sharing a home when a mother needs a place to live than when the adult child does. Responses to open-ended questions show that individuals invoke both universalistic family obligations and particularistic qualities of family relationships to explain their attitudes.

0	In recent years, club-drug use among a segment of urban gay men has gained in popularity, contributing to a range of outcomes, including heightened sexual stimulation, increased sexual performance and endurance, but also, unsafe sexual practices, drug overdose, drug addiction and death. This paper draws from a larger study of urban sexual careers and identifies two forms of club-drug use: the first, to facilitate sexual performance; and the second, to facilitate community.  I argue that the basis of both patterns of drug use lie in adaptations to the institutional organization of gay sexual sociality.
0	Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is a chain referral or “snowball”-type sampling and analysis methodology originally developed for studying hidden or hard to reach populations. The method goes beyond other snowball sampling techniques by incorporating sampling procedures and analytical tools that allow for the calculation of unbiased population estimates. Now widely used in studies of hidden populations, RDS data provide a wealth of information and potential for social network analysis by shifting the unit of analysis from nodes to ties in the network. This paper utilizes unique additions to an RDS dataset that allow the empirical evaluation of an RDS affiliation measure easily conducted with standard RDS data. Additionally, two techniques for measuring transitivity with RDS that require supplemental network data are discussed.
1	This study sets out to investigate whether introducing molecular genetic measures into an analysis of sexual partner variety will yield novel sociological insights. The data source is the white male DNA sample in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The authors' empirical gene-environment interaction analysis produces a robust protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype relative to the Any10R genotype in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). This protective effect tends to be lost in schools in which higher proportions of students start having sex early, as well as in individuals with relatively low cognitive ability. The genetics-informed sociological analysis here suggests that explaining a human trait or behavior may require a theory that accommodates the complex interplay between social contextual and individual influences and genetic predispositions.
0	There has emerged a colossal literature on social, political and economic aspects of the transition to capitalism in the formerly communist Central and Eastern European countries after 1989. As the shift from centrally planned to market economies has produced both winners and losers, the social aspects of the transition became not only an area of academic inquiry but also important political terrain. Leaving their communist legacies shaped in Moscow and passing through the neoliberal experiment designed by Washington, these countries found themselves entered in the chamber of Brussels today. Despite such an overwhelming experimentation, the question of whether these transition countries will be able to develop welfare states capable of delivering social justice to their citizens is yet to be answered. This paper opens up a venue to analyze closely the remaking of welfare states in the Central and East European countries during their political and economic transformations. More specifically, by observing and laying out the transition processes of the Central and East European countries in regards to their social policy developments during the 1990s and until their accession to the European Union, the paper demonstrates ways in which socialist social security mechanisms are dismantled and social policy is reconstructed of in the region in the last one and a half decade.
1	Using ideas from cultural and organizational theory, I examine the interplay of individual and congregation-level educational attainment on biblical literalism. Data on 387 congregations and 100,009 worshippers (US Congregational Life Survey, 2001) are used to test hypotheses. Results indicate that the effects of congregational education and individual educational attainment are among the largest effects in models. This study is the first to show that regardless of an individual's own education, affirmations of biblical literalism are less likely when persons with higher education dominate a congregation. This finding brings into relief the important role of social context in persons' belief in biblical literalism. Additionally, congregational education amplifies the influence of individual education on biblical literalism such that the gap in belief between college/non-college education individuals widens in high education congregations. This finding suggests that high education persons more deeply absorb the influence of a more educated congregational context. 
0	Scholars have long debated how access to the public sphere was affected by the rise of mass media.  We answer this question by studying magazines in America from the mid eighteenth century, when all magazines were small-circulation, to the mid nineteenth century, when many magazines reached mass audiences.  We investigate who had access to the public sphere by studying the social positions of those who founded new magazines.  Our analysis shows that in the earliest years, magazine founders were part of the social elite – publishing-industry insiders, professionals, and the highly educated – but later, magazine founders were much more like “everyman” – not only members of the social elite, but also many people of middling social stature.  Moreover, magazine entrepreneurship evolved from an individual pursuit to an increasingly organizationally-sponsored activity, reflecting increased civic engagement.  In addition, roles in magazine management became increasingly less specialized, and each role became more accessible to founders from different backgrounds.  And magazines founded by publishing-industry insiders became concentrated in major publishing centers, while magazines founded by professionals and other outsiders became more geographically dispersed.  These results bolster our conclusion that access to the public sphere in America expanded greatly between the mid eighteenth and mid nineteenth centuries.
0	Structural as well as family process variables were employed in the prediction of early sexual onset in a national sample of youth. Structural variables spanned three generations and included information regarding the level of education, household composition, and childbearing ages of target youths mothers and grandmothers. Family process variables included maternal monitoring and maternal rejection. Data were from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) and included information on 1,416 adolescents aged 12  13 in 1997 and 17  18 in 2002 gathered from multiple reporters. Results indicated that although mothers age at first birth and household composition remained significant in the final model, there may also be indirect effects of grandmother and mother characteristics on sexual onset via parental process. Additionally, interactions revealed that historical and contemporary structural variables influenced the sexual onset of boys, while family process in the form of maternal monitoring was influential for girls. Finally, intact household composition buffered the effect of poverty on early sexual onset.
1	Social context is increasingly recognized as essential for understanding complex human outcomes even among geneticists who focus on genetic influences. These outcomes typically involve multiple genes, multiple environmental factors, and the interactions between the two. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for gene-environment interaction and show how the interaction can be tested empirically using a sample of MZ twin, DZ twins, and full siblings. We test the hypothesis that the genetic contribution to adolescent drinking depends on the drinking behavior of their friends, using a sample of clusters of siblings and their friends from Add Health. Our analysis has yielded evidence supporting the gene-environment interaction hypothesis. High levels of alcohol use by one's best friend or among one's friends tend to bring about higher levels of genetic contribution to alcohol use. Lower levels of alcohol use by one's best friend or among one's friends tend to suppress the level of genetic contribution to alcohol use. Our findings suggest that friend behavior might be a particularly important environmental moderator of the expression of genetic disposition for adolescent drug use, smoking, dietary habits, and risky sexual behavior. Subsequent studies of these behaviors that use non-DNA twin samples or DNA measures of genetic variants should investigate peer influence as a significant environmental moderator. 
0	The Mexican government’s innovative program 3 X 1 para Migrantes matches investments made by Mexican hometown associations (HTAs) and in doing so, aids in the development of migrant communities throughout México. Previous research, however, demonstrates that this process is gendered. Researchers argue that male migrants tend to dominate leadership positions within the HTA structure because they long to return to patriarchal México, while women migrants prefer to settle permanently in the U.S., where social relationships are more egalitarian. I argue that hard and fast notions of Mexican patriarchy conceal important variation at the leadership level in HTAs. The results of logistic regression on data provided by the Institute for Mexicans Abroad and the U.S. Census Bureau reveal that the location of HTAs in the U.S. has a significant effect on the gender of organization leaders and contrary to previous research, the presence of the Mexican state is found to have a positive effect on the participation of women in HTAs.
1	We ask whether ethnic residential segregation influences the future educational careers of children of immigrants in Sweden. We use a dataset comprising a cohort of children who finished compulsory school in 1995 (n = 6,560). We follow these children retrospectively to 1990 to measure neighborhood characteristics during late childhood, and prospectively through 2003 to measure the number of years of education attained thus far. The largest immigrant groups came from Finland, Turkey, former Yugoslavia, Iran and Chile. Our empirical analysis reveals that immigrant children who grow up in neighborhoods with many young coethnics who have limited educational resources, obtain relatively low average grades from compulsory school, and on average, do not attain the same levels of education as do immigrant children who grow up elsewhere. For a minority of immigrant children who lived in neighborhoods with educationally successful young coethnics, we find a positive effect of growing up in an ethnic enclave. Also in this case, the effect of the ethnic environment on future educational attainment is mediated by school results in compulsory school.
0	The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationships between ethnic conflict, in-group/out-group polarization, and gender attitudes in post-war Croatia.  We examine the effect of war-related experiences (e.g., fighting in the war of national separation, having one?s home destroyed, etc.) on general and policy-related gender attitudes.  We explore in-group polarization (i.e., positive attitudes towards one?s own ethnic group) and out-group polarization (i.e., negative attitudes toward other ethnic groups) as the primary mechanisms linking war-related experiences to gender attitudes.  Results, based on 1996 data from a nationally representative sample of Croatia, suggest that conflict has both direct and indirect effects on gender attitudes.  However, only out-group polarization leads to more conservative gender attitudes.  In fact, in-group polarization leads to more liberal gender attitudes for both women and men.  A key implication of this study is that scholars should make a clear distinction between in-group polarization and out-group polarization because they have different sources and different effects on gender attitudes.
1	"This article looks at the fateful 1988 fuselage failure of Aloha Airlines Flight 243 to suggest and illustrate a new perspective on the sociology of technological accidents. Drawing on core insights from the sociology of scientific knowledge, it highlights, and then challenges, a fundamental principle underlying our understanding of technological risk: a realist epistemology that tacitly assumes that technological knowledge is objectively knowable and that ""failures"" always connote ""errors"" that are, in principle, foreseeable. From here, it suggests a new conceptual tool by proposing a novel category of man-made calamity: the ""epistemic accident,"" grounded in a constructivist understanding of knowledge. It concludes by exploring the implications of epistemic accidents and a constructivist approach to failure, sketching their relationship to broader issues concerning technology and society, and reexamining conventional ideas about technology, accountability, and governance."
0	Historically there has been an imposition of mysticism around the creative processes of music based in the notion of autonomy, both of music and the individuals involved in its practice from wider social and cultural processes (Shepherd, 1992, p. 128).  This is eminently true in the case of the compositional process, the core or very close to the core of what we may refer toas the musicians knowledge of music (Seeger, 1969, p. 231). Drawing on extant historical, contemporary, psychological, educational and sociological research, as well as interviews carried out by the author, a two-fold argument will be presented arguing that the process of composition, while often an individualistic activity, is a social process. Using Bourdieus habitus and Beckers art worlds it will be argued that composers operate within a compositional habitus. Following from Durkheims notion of society and the mind it will be shown that the very act of composing involves social interaction; consideration of the other. Finally, with a view to Weber it will be proposed that musicology and sociology, despite the current divide (see Martin, 2006, pp. 13-31), can meet in a discourse over the text when it is considered a social product.
0	This paper compares the approaches to discussing class and racism of working-class members and college-educated professional-middle-class members of U.S. progressive social movement organizations (SMOs). In a study of 25 varied SMOs in five states, ironically, working-class group members had lower rates of explicit references to class identities and class analysis. In an analysis of interviewees’ opportunities to mention class, conventional class terms such as “working-class” and “middle-class” were used mostly by college-educated activists, while working-class activists talked about class primarily by mentioning particular hardships, occupations and other concrete referents. Similarly, with race discourse, a statistically significant relationship was found between college education and an institutionalized white supremacy frame on racism, and between the lifelong-working-class category and an anti-bigotry frame. Comparing two cases of anti-racism discussions at naturally occurring meetings of racially diverse SMOs, one majority professional-middle-class, one majority working-class, illustrates the class-cultural perspectives underlying these contrasting approaches to racism.  These differences in anti-racism approaches and class talk appear to grow out of the different paths to activism taken by working-class and college-educated professional-middle-class SMO participants, as well as to more concrete and more abstract classed speech codes.
1	We use the life course perspective to argue that family transitions like divorce and remarriage are turning points in adolescents' lives and that emotional distress associated with these events are shaped by the circumstances surrounding them. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ( Add Health), we explore how family transitions net of family structure are related to two types of emotional distress, acute depressive symptoms and excessive binge drinking, and whether family context moderates these associations. We find that going through a family transition is related to both outcomes, but only under certain circumstances. As maternal-adolescent emotional distance increases, the probability of severe emotional distress following a family transition increases. In addition, transitioning out of a single mother versus a mother-father household is related to a lower probability of reporting acute depressive symptoms.
1	"McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Brashears (2006, 2008b) reported that Americans' social networks shrank precipitously from 1985 to 2004. When asked to list the people with whom they discussed ""important matters,"" respondents to the 2004 General Social Survey (GSS) provided about one-third fewer names than did respondents in the 1985 survey Critically, the percentage of respondents who provided no names at all increased from about 10 percent in 1985 to about 25 percent in 2004. The 2004 results contradict other relevant data, however and they contain serious anomalies: this suggests that the apparently dramatic increase in social isolation is an artifact. One possible source of the artifact is the section of the 2004 interview preceding the network question; it may have been unusually taxing. Another possible source is a random technical error With as yet no clear account for these inconsistencies and anomalies, scholars should be cautious in using the 2004 network data. Scholars and general readers alike should draw no inference from the 2004 GSS as to whether Americans' social networks changed substantially between 1985 and 2004; they probably did not."
0	A growing number of high school students are involved in dual enrollment programs of one form or another, ranging from programs in which high school students do work to earn college credit (e.g., through Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate programs) to actual enrollment in college courses prior to high school graduation.  At the same time, it is clear that large numbers of students who are formally enrolled in post-secondary institutions are doing secondary school-level work (e.g., through high school completion programs, GED programs, or remedial coursework).  In the former case, secondary school students are essentially doing post-secondary level work.  In the latter case, post-secondary school students are essentially doing secondary level work.  However, researchers who analyze the transition to post-secondary schooling almost universally treat secondary and post-secondary schooling as discrete, non-overlapping entities.  We pursue three objectives in this paper.  First, we quantify the degree of blurriness in the boundary between secondary and post-secondary education.  What fraction of secondary school students is essentially doing post-secondary school work?  What fraction of post-secondary school students is essentially doing secondary school work?  Second, we describe inequalities by race/ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic circumstances in the blurriness of the boundary between secondary and post-secondary schooling.  Third, we compare models of the transition to post-secondary schooling that view that transition as discrete and non-overlapping to those that view that transition as gradual and nuanced.  To do so we analyses data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 and from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study.
0	The most striking characteristic of the Korean economy during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 was that the whole economic system abruptly fell apart like a house of cards. In 1997-1998, about a half of the top 30 Korean business groups filed for bankruptcy. The country was virtually on the verge of collapse. This paper explains that the fundamental cause of the crisis was not just the financial defaults of the chaebol; rather it was structural in nature. The crisis was not independent of the Korean economic structure that is dominated by a very few extraordinarily powerful business groups, the chaebol. To understand the dynamics of the crisis, this paper digs deeper into the nature of Korean capitalism, a form of capitalism in which oligopolistic economic dominance of a few chaebol shapes the economy. This paper challenges the long-standing view of the Korean developmental state as rational industry shaper. This paper argues that industrial choices by the Korean state from one to another are fundamentally the reactions to, not the directions for, the chaebol. The Korean state's role reflected the chaebol-dominated industrial structure. These characteristics of the industrial process are what created the developmental role of the Korean state.
1	The last quarter of the twentieth century saw an erosion of job security in both manual and professional occupations. In this article, we investigate how the proliferation of employee involvement schemes in manual production and the growth of layoffs, temporary outsourcing, and project-based teams in the professions have influenced working conditions in both manual and professional settings. We argue that these practices represent not a departure from scientific management as is often presumed, but rather adoption of Taylorist principles not fully manifested in Fordist-era mass production. Flexible practices have thus expanded the influence of scientific management in manual work, and extended the scope of its application into the professions in an era perhaps more aptly termed neo-Taylorist than post-Fordist. Using data derived from the population of workplace ethnographies, we evaluate historical shifts in the organization of manual and professional work and outcomes for employees. Our findings support accounts critical of the nature and degree of change in manual jobs and suggest that post-Fordist shifts in the professions have successfully ushered in intensification analogous to what Fordist strategies accomplished in manual work-with unintended negative consequences for workers. Our conclusions point to a general deterioration of conditions in both manual and professional occupations due at least in part to an increasingly rigorous application of the principles of scientific management to both types of work.
0	Through interview data, I explore how a person manages an illness that fails to be clearly defined as a stigmatizing mark.  This situation creates a person who is both socially isolated due to her own perception of having a stigma, but also intricately dependent on the social environment in order to determine whether that environment allows for this perception of her behavior or mark.  Because of the ambiguity of a stigma label, the moral career of a potentially stigmatized person does not necessarily assume a fixed pattern of interaction given a particular locale or group, as suggested by Goffman. In this paper, I further Goffmans initial work on stigma management by exploring the decision-making processes of women with allergies in light of the liminal and shifting sense of what is actually being stigmatized.  The stigma for allergies comes from this liminal definitional state and the persons ability or inability to manage the meaning of allergies.  It does not come from an established assignment of discredibility to an attribute by the finger tips of society.    Thus, for women with allergies, choices about illness management are often not about the illness and a designation of stigma prior to interaction, but complex life experiences that define what that designation should be at any given moment.  This necessitates particular understandings of self and identity and a type of artfulness to interacting within ones environment not explored by Goffman.
1	Racial segregation in schools and neighborhoods in the United States is stark and persistent. The results of this research provide clues as to why it may be so enduring. We find that as predominantly white schools in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area experience increases in black representation of up to seven percentage points during a four- to five-year period, white neighborhood residents are more likely to perceive that the quality of their schools has declined, despite the current conditions of the schools and in spite of changes in school characteristics. Our results are more consistent with racial threat theory than contact theory because they suggest that white residents may initially be threatened by racial change and judge declining school quality according to the racial change itself As a consequence, white families may flee these integrating schools and neighborhoods, further contributing to school and neighborhood segregation.
1	In this article we use comparative micro data for 15 European countries covering the period 1992-2007 to study the impact of labor market reforms on the skill-related individual risk of holding a temporary contract and the risk of being unemployed. Our results indicate no general increase in either of these skill gaps. Using two-step multilevel analyses, we show that in the case of high protection of regular contracts, lowering restrictions on the use of temporary contracts increases the relative temporary employment rates of low-skilled workers. However, this kind of partial deregulation, which has been implemented in the majority of Western European countries, has not translated into decreasing unemployment risks of the low-skilled vis-a-vis medium- and highly-skilled persons.
1	Researchers have commonly invoked isolation from job opportunities as an explanation for persistence of gender and race inequality in the labor market, but few have examined whether access to information about job opportunities varies by race and gender. Findings from nationally representative survey data reveal significant white male advantage in the number of job leads received through routine conversations when compared to white women and Hispanics. Differences in social network resources (social capital) partly explain the deficit among Hispanics, but fail to account for the job lead gap between white women and men. Further analyses show that inequality in the receipt of job information is greatest at the highest levels of supervisory authority, where white males receive substantially more job leads than women and minorities.
0	This study is designed to show that much of Erving Goffman’s writing is crypto-biographical, that his sociological imagination fed on his personal experience, and that several key turns in his intellectual career reflected his life trajectory.  I begin by tying in “The Insanity of Place” to Asylums and showing the transformation that Goffman’s treatment of mental illness underwent over the course of years.  Next, I cross-reference Goffman’s account with that of his contemporaries.  And finally make the case that Goffman’s entire theoretical corpus reflects his personal experience as a son of Jewish immigrants who struggled to raise himself from the obscurity of Canadian Manitoba to international stardom.  In conclusion, I touch upon the contribution that the Erving Goffman Archives can make to biocritical hermeneutics – a research program focused on the relationship between theory, biography, and culture.
1	Quantitative scholarship on civil wars has long debated whether ethnic diversity breeds armed conflict. We go beyond this debate and show that highly diverse societies are not more conflict prone. Rather states characterized by certain ethnopolitical configurations of power are more likely to experience violent conflict. First, armed rebellions are more likely to challenge states that exclude large portions of the population on the basis of ethnic background. Second, when a large number of competing elites share power in a segmented state, the risk of violent infighting increases. Third, incohesive states with a short history of direct rule are more likely to experience secessionist conflicts. We test these hypotheses for all independent states since 1945 using the new Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) data set. Cross-national analysis demonstrates that ethnic politics is as powerful and robust in predicting civil wars as is a country level of economic development. Using multinomial logit regression, we show that rebellion, infighting, and secession result from high degrees of exclusion, segmentation, and incohesion, respectively. More diverse states, on the other hand, are not more likely to suffer from violent conflict.
0	In this paper we ask who in China would choose to enter self-employment after economic reforms were initiated in 1979 and private business once again became legal.  Given the Communist Party's official vilification of business owners from the 1950s through the 1970s, the question of who would 'jump into the sea' of private business is an intriguing. In our analysis of a randomly drawn nationwide sample of urban Chinese residents, we identify four distinct policy shifts between 1978 and 1996.  During the first period, men were much more likely to become self-employed than women  an advantage which held true through 1995.   Younger people were also more likely to enter self-employment early in the reform era, but as with maleness, the magnitude of this factor  also declined over time.  People with state-enterprise jobs and government jobs were less likely to 'take the plunge' when reform began than others, but gradually joined the ranks of the self-employed as time passed and as it became clear that reforms were not just temporary policy shifts or economic 'experiments'.  We also investigate the effects of party membership, educational achievement, and bourgeois family background, with results varying across the four periods.
1	The rapid growth in cohabitation in recent decades has coincided with a burgeoning literature on the topic. Yet despite a sustained increase in cohabitation among middle-aged and older adults, this group has received little research attention. Close relationships are integral to well-being and the quality of these relationships has consequences for health, especially among older adults. We use data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative sample of 3005 people ages 57-85 to compare the relationship quality of older cohabitors versus marrieds. The two groups are remarkably similar. Cohabitors and marrieds do not significantly differ in their reports of emotional satisfaction, pleasure, openness, time spent together, criticism, and demands. Cohabitors are less likely than marrieds to report that their relationship is very happy. There is some evidence of gender by union type differences. Cohabiting unions among older adults tend to be of relatively long duration. Overall, these results indicate that cohabitation may operate as an alternative to marriage for older adults.

0	This paper explores the link between the lack of a widespread posttraumatic stress anniversary effect in the ranks of the NYPD and the quasi-primary relationships experienced by members of the New York City Police Department living in suburban and outer city communities. The paper provides a sound research based sociological theory using the framework of suburban relationships envisioned by Herbert Gans to explain the absence of an anniversary effect in the NYPDs first responders on an organizational level. To arrive at a conclusion, the researcher, a retired NYPD officer, gathered ethnographic data using non-traditional methods including internet instant messaging services to conduct interviews with the police first responders.
1	Accumulating evidence from behavioral genetics suggests that the vast majority of individual-level outcomes of abiding sociological interest are genetically influenced to a substantial degree. This raises the question of the place of genetics in social science explanations. Genomic causation is described from a counterfactualist perspective, which makes its complexity plain and highlights the distinction between identifying causes and substantiating explanations. For explanation, genomic causes must be understood as strictly mediated by the body. One implication is that the challenge of behavioral genetics for sociology is much more a challenge from psychology than biology, and a main role for genetics is as a placeholder for ignorance of more proximate influences of psychological and other embodied variation. Social scientists should not take this challenge from psychology as suggesting any especially fundamental explanatory place for either it or genetics, but the contingent importance of genetic and psychological characteristics is itself available for sociological investigation.
1	Concerns about decreasing response rates have led to many nonresponse studies. Unfortunately, usually only a limited amount of data is available on nonrespondents. Linking administrative data makes information available on all the sampled units including nonrespondents. Statistics Netherlands has constructed a database in which several administrative records and several surveys are connected. In this explorative study we use this dataset to look for homogenous groups of respondents and nonrespondents in survey research using latent class cluster analysis. Latent class techniques can provide insight into the problem of selective nonresponse and currently under-represented societal groups. We identify four different latent classes in a recent Dutch survey and replicate the findings for the same survey conducted 4 years later. Two of the types of sampled units have above-average response rates and the other two have below-average response rates. We also evaluate various latent class models with other response outcomes to gain insight into the contact and cooperation process.

This entailed governmental licensing of brothels, registration of women as prostitutes, enforced compulsory medical examinations for these women and the detainment of sick or resistant prostitutes in lock hospitals.   Concomitantly, abolitionist movements against the regulation of prostitution formed in different European countries at the behest of an international abolitionist organization, and with the involvement of an international association of purity reformers also interested in prostitution.  Two trends occurred:  (1) democratic states moved quickly away from regulation, with the exception of France; and (2) autocratic states maintained regulation for longer periods of time, with the exception of Russia.  Using a comparative-historical approach, I outline the paths toward deregulation in a subset of states to determine the degree of abolitionist influence and the subsequent effect on the organization of prostitution.  Where abolitionists moved toward transnational feminist discourses and allied with socialists, regulation was abolished.  However, where abolitionists lacked the involvement of a feminist movement, alliances were made with purity reformers who called for increased governmental control of sexuality.  In such cases, regulation was sustained.  These findings highlight the importance of international organizations and their discourses in changing domestic social policies, and suggest that they can actually reinforce rather than transcend national interests.
0	Owning a single-family home is an important component of the American dream. Contrary to the arguments of homebuilders who claim that Americans desire ever-increasing houses, this study utilizes Bourdieus research on tastes and distinction to argue for the significant roles of volume of capital and economic versus cultural capital in explaining why Americans chose their homes. Our analysis of data from the 2005 American Housing Survey, administered by the U.S. Census Bureau, reveals that single-family homeowners with lower volumes of capital purchase their home for more practical reasons while those with more capital purchase on aesthetic grounds. In addition, we find that among those who purchase single-family homes for aesthetic reasons, bachelor and graduate degrees differentiate between those who buy for room layout and design versus those who buy because all reasons were equal. We discuss the implications of our findings as well as consider how sociologists might better uncover single-family housing tastes in the United States.
0	In this paper, we argue that LGBT youth use the internet in complex ways to find information and develop connections to others in the form of friendships, communities, and romantic relationships. Using quantitative and qualitative data about both LGBT and non-LGBT youth, we show the specifics of LGBT youth’s use of the internet. In doing so, we provide a nuanced view of the space deprivation argument as a basis for youth’s online behavior, and underscore the importance of online resources to LGBT youth who face either or both isolation or the burden of the “small numbers.” In line with sociology of youth perspectives, we make abundant use of youth’s own words; yet we also provide statistical grounding to our arguments.
1	This Presidential Address develops a sociological concept of citizenship, particularly substantive citizenship, as fundamentally a matter of belonging, including recognition by other members of the community. In this conception, citizenship is not simply a fixed legal status, but a fluid status that is produced through everyday practices and struggles. Historical examples illustrate the way in which boundaries of membership are enforced and challenged in everyday interactions. The experience of undocumented immigrant college students is particularly illuminating. These students occupy a position of liminal legality, which transcends fixed categories such as legal and illegal. As they go about their daily lives, their standing is affirmed in some settings and denied in others. Furthermore, the undocumented student movement, which asserts that education is a human and social right, represents a form of insurgent citizenship, one that challenges dominant formulations and offers an alternative and more inclusive conception.
0	Oakland youth find themselves in a precarious moment, forged by Neoliberalism and Neoconservativism. Through neoliberal reforms, youth of color attend inadequate public schools while the Neoconservative turn resulted in the merging of the punitive, right arm of the state along with the curative, left arm of the state, such that nurturing institutions increasingly participate in the criminalization of youth of color. Given that we now live with the largest incarceration project in human history, this research project seeks to evaluate the role high schools play in the education to incarceration pipeline. This research project will take a Gramscian approach to understand Oaklands youth subculture, while employing a Foucauldian analysis of the high school within the carceral continuum (Foucault 1979; Gramsci 2000).
0	Since 1934, domestic industries in the United States have found it increasingly more difficult to make the US government adhere to their protectionist demands. What are the factors determining protectionist policies in the United States and their transformation over time? Political sociology has been largely concerned with domestic factors for explaining policy outcomes, and has rarely integrated international considerations into the analysis. Yet, the history of US trade policy from the 1930s to the present shows that an adequate analysis of policy outcomes necessitates the inclusion also of international factors. Moreover, the case of protectionist policies shows that the relative explanatory significance of domestic and international factors is not constant but changes over time. An adequate analysis of policy outcomes therefore also necessitates an exploration of the conditions shaping the relative explanatory significance of domestic and international factors, and of how this relative significant changes over time. In this paper I draw on historical institutionalist analysis to show that the institutional structures of both states and international organizations account for the historically-specific balance between domestic and international factors: by shaping the political influence of actors in and across the two realms, institutions determine which considerations are prioritized. In the empirical part of the paper I offer a detailed historical analysis of US trade policy and show the usefulness of the theoretical argument for explaining transformations over time.
0	Public worship situations are routinely analyzed as loci of sociality and community formation, providing members with ways of understanding, ordering and narrating their experience. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in a Jewish Orthodox community in Los Angeles, I argue that an important part of what makes public worship situations compelling is how they interactionally highlight individual congregants’ lives. I present interactions that emerge in two contexts: (a) “information gaps” encoded in the structure of daily Orthodox prayer, and; (b) the religious requirement to pray with a quorum of ten adult men. Through these examples I make two interrelated arguments. First, codified aspects of public worship give rise to exigencies and variations that members understand to highlight individual congregants’ lives. Public worship is compelling partly because it actually individualizes participation. Second, as these interactions are predicated on a codified structure, they are routinized and often predictable. Thus, an appreciation of this aspect of public worship provides grounds for a broad comparative agenda, studying variations in interaction patterns in other public worship-contexts.
1	"Many social movement researchers question the usefulness of political opportunity as a concept. However, others argue that it can be refined by disaggregating different opportunities for actors and outcomes to understand the underlying mechanisms that influence each. This research extends this analysis by asking ""Political opportunityfor whom?"" Looking at Canadian Aboriginal mobilization, it assesses how different opportunities influence a broad range of movement actors and organizations. Using data from a 50-year period it assesses how contemporaneous, lagged and change regression modeling of opportunities affect results. The article finds that structural opportunities around resources robustly influence a wide range of mobilization."
1	Politics is arguably the arena in which gender inequality remains most pronounced. Yet in recent decades, women in some countries and regions of the world have made significant gains in legislative presence at the national level. But for women living outside of the industrialized West, we know little about the processes that facilitate their entry into politics. Through separate analyses of 36 high-income, 86 middle-income, and 63 low-income countries, I demonstrate that past models of women's political representation fail to explain variation across low-income samples. Using multiple methods, I also explore two sets of factors that may be more salient predictors of women's parliamentary representation in low-income nations: civil war and international linkages. Although historically women have been unable to consolidate gains made during wartime into post-conflict political representation, I find that certain types of civil conflict during the 1980s and 1990s positively affect women's representation in low-income nations. Longer, larger-scale wars that contest the political system or serve to alter the composition of the government have the best prospects for creating opportunities for women to gain parliamentary seats. Brief case studies of women, war, and social change in Rwanda, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tajikistan suggest that structural and cultural mechanisms may work in conjunction with political openings to produce post-conflict gains in women's political presence. Both women's lack of political representation and the tragic effects of civil war remain enduring challenges faced by the developing world, but at the intersection of these two problems, there is hope for women seeking political access.
0	Scholars across several disciplines have heavily debated the validity of Afrocentricity.  Some critics propose that Afrocentricity is simply a vehicle for promoting racism, while others contend that it stands on weak or fabricated theoretical grounds.  However, in the wake of these often-heated debates social scientists have begun to move beyond argumentative discourse to build observable evidence regarding the viability of Afrocentricity to solve social problems plaguing the black community.  In an attempt to contribute to the scholarly discussion, I investigate the impact Afrocentricity has on volunteer participation and involvement.  Using a national probability sample of 406 black respondents, I initially test the correlation between respondents self-identification with an African ethnicity and their reported behaviors and attitudes that are congruent with five Afrocentric constructs, spirituality, purposeful living, collectivism, tolerance and empowerment.  Next, logistic models are built to regress five measures of volunteer participation and involvement on self-identification with an African ethnicity, the only significantly correlated construct, empowerment, and a set of control variables.  The findings reveal that an African ethnic identity is unable to predict any measure of involvement and participation.  However, the empowerment construct significantly predicts a respondents interest in local affairs and national affairs, as well as community involvement.  Although this paper does not attempt to resolve the debate surrounding the topic, it does offer an important empirical investigation of Afrocentric and its possible utility in addressing community issues.
1	The concept that we live in small world networks connected by short paths has proved fascinating. These networks, however, do not typically emerge as linear responses to individual-level changes; rather, subtle changes in relations produce extraordinarily different macrolevel outcomes. Similarly, nuances in how we conceptualize, define, and measure relations can lead to widely different network characterizations. The author demonstrates this variability using a spectrum of interaction types and argue that the dependence of results on subtleties in definition or measurement makes theoretical interpretation difficult. He offers an index to calculate how much inaccuracy or imprecision relational definitions or data-gathering techniques can tolerate before results yield utterly different interpretations.
1	Conventional social mobility research, which measures family social class background relative to only fathers' characteristics, presents an outmoded picture of families-a picture wherein mothers' economic participation is neither common nor important. This article demonstrates that such measurement is theoretically and empirically untenable. Models that incorporate both mothers' and fathers' characteristics into class origin measures fit observed mobility patterns better than do conventional models, and for both men and women. Furthermore, in contrast to the current consensus that conventional measurement strategies do not alter substantive research conclusions, analyses of cohort change in social mobility illustrate the distortions that conventional practice can produce in stratification research findings. By failing to measure the impact of mothers' class, the current practice misses a recent upturn in the importance of family background for class outcomes among men in the United States. The conventional approach suggests no change between cohorts, but updated analyses reveal that inequality of opportunity increased significantly for men born since the mid-1960s compared with those born earlier in the century.
0	In recent years, there have been various efforts by sociologists and other scholars to formulate more adequate theoretical frameworks or theories for analyzing the environment.  Our own theoretical thrust is not only to integrate the conceptualizations of selected scholars but also to bring to the fore issues that have not received the attention they deserve. Given our knowledge about the process of constructing the Edwards Aquifer Authority, we weave together key theoretical elements of three major scholars who have addressed the environment:  Ulrich Beck, Walter Firey, and Elinor Ostrom. We first sketch out the basic conceptual contributions of each of these distinguished environmental scholars, before next exploring how their conceptual advances might be integrated into a broader socio-cultural framework for interpreting the environment in general and, more specifically, resource use. In the process we suggest how this framework can prove useful in understanding not only the Texas experience but other situations as well.
0	Welfare recipients are a highly stigmatized group, and stereotypes of those receiving government aid are distinctly gendered and racialized.  Research examining the psychological well-being of women on welfare shows that they report more mental health problems than women in the general population, and that they are acutely aware of their stigmatized position.  However, little research investigates whether holding negative beliefs about welfare use – that is, internalizing negative images of “welfare queens” – damages the psychological well-being of women on welfare.  This study examines the relationship between Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipient status, belief in welfare stereotypes, and depression among a large sample of white and African-American women.  My analyses indicate that women receiving TANF are more depressed than their counterparts who are not on TANF.  Additionally, holding negative beliefs about welfare use is associated with depression among women who receive TANF, suggesting that negative stereotypes of welfare users may have been internalized.  I also find that African-American women report more depression in association with belief in welfare stereotypes than white women when examining the full sample, but interestingly, not when restricting analyses to women on welfare. The implications of these findings for research on stigma and welfare dependency stereotypes are discussed.
0	Boltanski and Chiapello have argued that today we are amidst a process of redefining capitalism according to a new justificatory regime, which they call project-oriented. Projects, unlike firms, are temporary entities, constructed with the explicit goal of bringing experts from different fields to collaborate for the solution of well-specified problems. If scientific management was the legitimizing rhetoric of the transition from entrepreneurial to corporate capitalism, what is the rhetoric of project management as it carries the transition from corporate to network capitalism?  Examining publications from the Project Management Institute, this paper aims at understanding what the introduction of standards and tools means for collaboration and recognition of performance in projects. The argument can be summarized in three statements: first, projects assemble experts, standards, tools, and technology into a temporary calculative framework allowing scripted performances; second, standards and norms enable collaboration that is neither improvised nor routinized and is at once close and distant; and third, routing networks of experts through projects gives rise to narratives of performance, among which new standards called Best Practices can be tested, affirmed, or discarded.
1	Despite a strong interest in media coverage of social problems, sociologists have failed to examine when and why news outlets present issues as problems in need of public action within short time periods. Through content analysis of 475 newspaper articles and negative binomial regression, I show that coverage of homelessness varies in the extent to which it presents homelessness as a social problem. The fact that not all news coverage discusses social problems challenges the claim that social problems necessarily compete for attention in a zero-sum game. I also examine the effects of three types of events (events promoted to the media by their actors and high- and low-profile events not promoted by their actors) on newspapers' likelihood of describing homelessness as a social problem. While previous researchers predicted that events not promoted by their actors would lead to media coverage that challenged the status quo, I find that actor-promoted events are much more likely to do so: This finding highlights the importance of institutionalized action in calling attention to social problems.
1	Researchers specializing in organizations and labor markets have paid insufficient attention to the effects that foreign ownership of a firm and its orientation towards export production may have on the wages it pays to its workers. Using information from a nationally-representative sample of manufacturing firms in Mexico, a paradigmatic case of a developing country that is highly integrated into world markets, we find that foreign-owned and export-oriented firms pay considerably more than nationally-owned firms engaged in the production of goods for sale in the domestic market. Second, beyond paying higher wages to their workers, foreign-owned firms also raise the wages paid by domestic firms operating in the same regional labor markets. The wage premium in foreign and export-oriented firms cannot be explained by their size, industry, geographical location, productivity, use of advanced technology, or the sociodemographic composition of their workforce. We find evidence that wages in foreign-owned companies in Mexico are dependent on the country of origin of the capital investment. A greater difference between the industry-specific wages paid in the country of ownership and Mexico is associated with a higher wage premium in Mexican affiliates. Future work should strive to link information from foreign-owned affiliates with their parent companies abroad. 
0	Genetic technologies (e.g., genetic diagnostics) have a number of implications for how we perceive ourselves and each other. Some researchers have suggested that such technologies are beneficial, as they create new forms of agency, personhood and responsibility. Drawing on the experiences of individuals in the Huntington Disease (HD) community, this presentation provides a counterpoint to such optimism and specifically problematizes the notion of genetic responsibility. In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 individuals with HD, as well as 10 informal caregivers (primarily spouses) in British Columbia, Canada. Two broad themes emerged from this data. First, participants described HD as a juxtaposition of chance and certainty. While genetic inheritance was situated as a “50/50” chance, having a genetic condition was discussed in fatalistic terms. Second, participants detailed the nuances of “genetic suffering”, noting that genetic conditions demotivated lifestyle changes (e.g., smoking cessation), facilitated a sense of anticipation for symptom onset and created unique experiences of burden and guilt. These findings are discussed in reference to Weber’s concept of theodicy and Bourdieu’s concept of sociodicy. These two concepts detail how suffering can be justified in reference to theology and social dynamics, respectively. This presentation concludes by advancing the concept of geneodicy, which provides a justification for genetic suffering in reference to personal and familial responsibility.

0	This paper reports on findings from an on-going field research project of indigenous Cuban religions as practiced in Oriente, Cuba.  Investigators of our Research Team have collected data through directed interviews, systematic observations, topical focus groups, and expressed participations.  These activities allowed us to comprehend the world of symbolic meanings in one of Cubas seven indigenous religions as practiced in eastern portions of the island.  The religion of focus is Mayombe, Palo/Palo Monte, a tradition evolved from encounters between Bakongo/Kikongo enslaved populations and Native American Indians that occurred during the sixteenth-century.  The focus of the paper is data on womens participation in Mayombe Palo/Palo Monte and the relationship of that participation to the practicing communitys understanding of power.  Data findings are descriptive and analyzed by way of conceptual understandings of social power and women.
0	The primary goal of this study is to explore how focus groups and participant observations shape research findings. We examine how social and emotional difficulties (SEDs) experienced by the African American women caregivers of Alzheimer’s sufferers are communicated in these settings. Specifically, we aim to: 1) examine how African American women caregivers describe (SEDs); 2) Compare the influences of different methods of qualitative data collection on caregivers’ descriptions of SEDs. We analyzed two focus group and four participant observation sessions. We found that both research settings were conducive in eliciting participant experiences but in different ways. Participants in both settings candidly discussed care giving obligations and responsibilities, needs for social support, and practical considerations that would facilitate care giving duties. However, focus groups provided narratives in the form of short stories, while participant observations data read as a continuous and cohesive portrayal of life experiences.
1	Does religious pluralism decrease religious participation or increase it? Secularization theorists claim the former, while religious economies proponents claim the latter, and each side has used estimated pluralism-participation correlations to support its argument. Using a formal game theoretic model, this article shows how religious market forces and regulations generate plausible pluralism-participation correlations, whether or not the direct causal mechanisms argued by either side of the debate exist. The model generates testable hypotheses concerning the pluralism-participation relationship at both local and national levels and yields insights into previous empirical work.
0	This paper employs Ulrich Beck's (1992, 1999) formulation of incalculable risk to analyze chronic disease in contemporary Western society and the resultant social transformations across multiple levels of scale.  Specifically, we explore the social structures in which management of contemporary health risks is embedded, as well as how the social psychological implications of risk incalculability affect individuals.  These micro-level phenomena in turn feed back into cultural transformations in health knowledge and healthcare institutions.  We discuss the rising significance of health lifestyles following the epidemiological transition as a starting point from which to analyze the incalculable nature of chronic disease risk, paying special attention to the ways that fracturing medical knowledge underlies the development of a variety of often opposing lifestyle practices.  Medicine has responded to these developments by institutionalizing a diversity of alternative healthcare models, and we organize these complex processes around macro- and micro-levels of scale using Beck's theory of risk in contemporary society as a starting place.
1	Survey methodologists are concerned that the interviewer's characteristics may affect respondents' answers. This paper investigates how the inter-viewer's education interacts with the respondent's perceptions and in turn affects the latter's responses to hard questions in a biotechnology survey in Taiwan. Our results indicate that respondents with little education (Junior high school or below) react to highly-educated interviewers by giving more substantive answers to both knowledge questions and attitude questions. These findings are consistent with findings in the literature on social psychology whereby the respondents can infer from the interviewer's appearance and behavior whether the latter seems more knowledgeable than themselves, and that in interacting with someone with much more education, the one with little education senses his or her inferiority and tries to conform to the perceived expectations.

0	While many aspects of leadership and work satisfaction have been heavily researched, member satisfaction with the style of leaders who provide treatment in groups has rarely been researched  An assumption underlying the present study is that certain leadership styles are associated with member satisfaction. This study examined the perception of leadership style and member satisfaction in treatment groups. Member satisfaction with leadership style was measured in the middle phase of treatment groups. A structured, close-ended questionnaire was developed. In the study  members of treatment groups perceived and were satisfied with democratic, social-emotional, task-oriented, and participatory leadership styles, and dissatisfied with autocratic, laissez-faire, and supervisory styles..

Observing the activity of design in talk-in-interaction is problematic in this article, and is examined through analyses and with reference to theory. Single case analysis of an extended data extract is presented to explore some actions in talk-in-interaction in which the activity of designing can be seen to be taking place. Significantly, some actions of the users are considered recognisable as producing moves in a design space, from preliminary analyses.
1	"Research examining the effects of welfare dynamics on children's development has provided little information to date on the experiences of immigrant children. Using longitudinal data collected during the period of welfare reform (1995-1999; the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. PHDCN), this study investigates whether welfare leaving is associated with changes in preschool-aged children's (n = 550) physical health (i.e., general health status, sick days, respiratory illness and emergency room visits) over time, and whether these associations differ by parents' nativity status. We find that children of immigrant welfare leavers fare significantly worse in terms of their health than their peers in either native leaver families, or immigrant families who continued to receive assistance. Associations are robust to the inclusion of a wide range of control variables including children's initial health status, family demographic characteristics, qualities of the home environment, and indicators of parents' physical and mental health. Negative impacts of welfare leaving on children's health appear to be concentrated among immigrants who have multiple ""barriers"" to program participation (i.e., limited English proficiency. fewer years residing in the US, households with no citizen parent, and self-reported experiences of discrimination).

1	Where do associations come from? The authors argue that the expansion and openness of state institutions encourage the formation of associations. Moreover, the institutional structures of world society provide important resources and legitimation for association. Longitudinal cross-national data on voluntary associations are analyzed using panel models with fixed-effects and instrumental variables models to address possible endogeneity. Institutional features of the state and the structures of world society are linked to higher levels of association, as are wealth and education. These factors differentially affect specific types of association, helping make sense of the distinctive configurations of civil society observed around the globe.
0	This paper draws on the data collected to date to reflect, on one hand, on the influence of urban spaces to build community, in Villa Victoria (South End, MA, USA) and Union Square (Somerville, MA, USA). On the other hand, it focus at revealing the nature and the role played by cultural and artistic events in the multi-ethnic neighborhood  Jamaica Plain , through the community arts based work of Spontaneous Celebrations. How can arts and culture be, simultaneously, the cause of division and social integration? In other words, how communities, in Jamaica Plain, can be empowered through the arts by the creation of both spaces of social difference, and spaces of personal and social connection, between people of different ethnic origins? These questions will be addressed in the presentation.
0	This paper examines global framing process by noting the big growth of the Korean environmental and human rights movements since their first encounter with the UN world conferences at Rio in 1992 and Vienna in 1993 respectively. Theoretically, this paper relies on the dual mechanism of the framing and socialization processes that operates at the domestic and international level. Given this, this paper examines the ways in which the two movement sectors learn, frame, and apply global ideas and norms to local concerns. Paradoxically, strong and contentious activism for democracy in Korea provided human rights groups with both obstacles and leverages to expand their activism into the transnational public sphere. Democratization as a master frame, that should have included other social issues, has been extremely tilted toward political issues. On the other hand, the Korean environmental movement swiftly turned their attention to new issues such as sustainable development, climate change, and GMOs. However, the Korean government misinterpreted the sustainable development frame to its advantage and then employed neoliberalism ideology for economic development. Arguably, both Korean environmental and human rights movements are now facing a new and strong master frame competitor, neoliberalism.
0	When policy issues involve complex technical questions, demonstrations are more likely to marshal charts, graphs, models, and simulations than to mobilize popular movements in the streets.  In this paper we analyze PowerPoint demonstrations, the most ubiquitous form of digital demonstrations.  Our first set of demonstrations are the PowerPoint representations made in December 2002 by the seven finalist architectural teams in the Innovative Design competition for rebuilding the World Trade Center.  Our second case occurred some blocks away, several months later: Colin Powells PowerPoint demonstration at the United Nations.  We argue that Edward Tuftes denunciation of PowerPoint does not capture the cognitive style made possible by the affordances of this pervasive new technology  and that our cases do not fit into Harry Collinss distinction between experiments, demonstrations, and epidictic displays of virtuosity.   We develop new concepts to highlight the spatial and temporal properties of digital forms of persuasion.
0	As we look forward into the mid 21st century, demographers forecast dramatic increases in cultural diversity in the general population of the United States, which will also be reflected in our elderly populations.  In fact, close to one third of our elderly populations is projected to be from ethnic minority groups. The forces of globalization, immigration and transnationalism will contribute to and shape this diversity. After talking about what globalization and transnationalism mean, I will discuss the implications of transnationalism for immigrant communities, with examples from the economic, political, cultural and familial spheres.  Through the course of this paper, I will highlight the three following issues: 1) the importance of rethinking our stationary ideas about aging in place to include conceptions of aging that incorporate  multidirectional migration patterns and multiple identities; 2) how such migration patterns, multiple identities and transnational ties shape immigrant ethnic minority expectations about aging and long-term care; and 3) how the forces of globalization increase the diversity among health and long term care workers who are providing care to our aging populations. I will end with some policy-relevant questions regarding the implications of globalization and transnational ties for ethnically diverse aging populations.
0	The main question to be addressed in this paper is: how domination of informal rules in business sphere influences formation of civil dialog between business and authorities in Russia? Using the outcomes of sociological research we consider the main features of informal relationships between business and authorities at micro-level, new tendencies in these relationships, which is the emergence of the phenomenon of informal (corrupt) mediating in state-business relationships. We also consider the emerging &#8220;civic sector&#8221; in the economy represented by various kinds of business associations and NGOs and the role they play in state-business dialog. A conclusion is made that currently informal bureaucratic mediating is going through the process of institutionalization which means that it has become generally accepted practice and autonomous business sphere. The process of institutionalization is becoming a crucial feature hindering development of civil society institutions. The analysis of &#8220;civic sector&#8221; in business sphere allows to assume that civil society institutions serve rather for institutionalization and formalization of &#8220;horizontal&#8221; relationships, than as mediators in &#8220;vertical&#8221; dialog between business and the state.
1	Previous studies have shown that as the percent black or percent Hispanic grows, that group's residential segregation from whites tends to increase as well. Typically, these findings are explained in terms of white discriminatory reaction to the perceived threat associated with minority population growth. The present analysis examines whether these racial threat effects depend on the extent of racial and ethnic diversity in an area. This possibility is tested by estimating otherwise standard models of black-white and Hispanic-white segregation using metropolitan area data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. censuses. Results from robust regression analyses strongly support the prediction for each of the white-minority pairs: the racial threat effect is significantly diminished in areas with greater multi-ethnic diversity.
0	"The project of Marxism, I argue in this paper, is primarily a project aimed toward the ontological transformation of existence and of the world. Located on the periphery of Marxism, phenomenological Marxism is largely unknown in the history of Marxism, yet of the various Marxisms of the twentieth century, phenomenological Marxism articulated one of the most radical and coherent ontological critiques of capitalism. Liberalism, in contrast, is a project which is more modest in that its goals are restricted to changing what Heidegger called the ontic details of the world. This paper addresses the theme of the annual conference through a comparison of liberal and Marxist understandings of what ""another world"" might be."
0	Social movement organizations and nonprofit organizations can affect local communities in numerous ways, some of which are intended and some of which are unintended.  Assessing the impact of these organizations is complicated because the effect that an organization has on a community depends on other attributes of the community in which it is embedded.  This article draws attention to the importance of multiorganizational fields in determining social movement consequences through an analysis of hate crime enforcement and reporting in U.S. Counties.  Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), in combination with more traditional statistical techniques, identifies 14 configurations of variable attributes that almost always result in reported hate crimes.  The analysis shows how measures of civil rights activism, political opportunities, grievances, and multiorganizational fields combine in local settings to produce hate crime reporting with near certainty.  Results indicate that the resourcefulness, heterogeneity, and funding sources of the nonprofit sector play a key role in determining whether hate crimes are reported.

One of the ideas behinds these programs is that if FGPSs can complete their degrees, then they will be more competitive with people from more advantaged backgrounds on the labor market. In this paper I use GSS data to analyze whether FGPSs earn less than non-FGPSs once they have finished their education. I test three explanations for an income gap: (1) differences in backgrounds, (2) differences in rates of degree completion, and (3) differences in rates of returns to higher education. I also analyze whether an income gap between FGPSs and non-FGPSs has changed over time and changes over the life-course. I find an initial income gap of 12 percent between FGPSs and non-FGPSs. The gap falls to about 6 percent after adjusting for background differences and the gap drops to 0 once different rates of degree completion are considered. I find no evidence of differences in rates of returns to higher education, changes over time, or changes over the life-course. These results suggest that programs to support FGPSs may be especially beneficial. They also highlight patterns of stratification among people who continue their education beyond high school that have been overlooked in the more general status attainment research.
1	"How do we attribute a monetary value to intangible things? This article offers a general sociological approach to this question, using the economic value of nature as a paradigmatic case, and oil spills litigations in France and the United States as real world empirical illustrations. It suggests that a full-blown sociology of economic valuation must solve three problems: the ""why,"" which refers to the general place of money as a metric for worth; the ""how,"" which refers to the specific techniques and arguments laymen and experts deploy to elicit monetary translations; and the ""then what"" or the feedback loop from monetary values to social practices and representations."

This paper focuses on Thailand, one of the major sites of production for cultural commodities, and interprets qualitative and historical materials to explain Thailands emergence in this sector.  Cultural beliefs lead the buyers to protect the performance of authenticity enacted by the sellers during critical moments when the sellers claim might be dismissed.  Modifying existing claims while forging new ones, the seller uses tact with regard to the tact taken by the buyer.  The cultural beliefs that enable such strategic maneuvers depend on the history of place, the pre-existing image that buyers have of the sellers national group, and the adeptness with which the sellers and producers play their parts.  Sellers, producers, and buyers find themselves embedded in images (national identity; cultural character) that facilitate the successful performance of some, but block other, claims.

We analyze recent cohort trends in rates of social mobility for men and women, and analyze the potential role of income inequality within and between classes in explaining these recent trends.
0	A global movement, over recent decades, has worked to restructure the former rights of people as citizens of national states into rights held by all humans and as the responsibility of all global social forces to protect. The present study describes the extent to which this change has impacted the constitutions of national states around the world. The results show that human rights language  formerly absent from almost all constitutions  now appears in many of the constitutions. Human rights language, obviously taken from the wider world society, is especially common in countries that are more susceptible to global influences. So it appears most frequently in newer constitutions, and in the constitutions of newly emergent national states. It is not merely characteristic of more developed or more democratic countries, once the effects of linkage to global civil society are taken into account.
0	In this paper we investigate the incidence of ethnic intermarriage among immigrants and their descendants, using data from Statistics Canadas 2003 Ethnic Diversity Survey.  We make a major contribution to the literature on immigrant assimilation by investigating variations in patterns of intermarriage across six distinct immigrant generation groups, defined as those arriving as adults, those arriving as children, and the second, 2.5 (distinguished by parental nativity) and third-plus generations.  Our analysis simultaneously models the odds of marriage to a spouse whose ethnic ancestry is partly the same as the respondents and marriage to a spouse whose ancestry is completely different from the respondents, versus marriage to a spouse whose ancestry is identical to the respondents.  Consistent with linear assimilation theory, we find that ethnic exogamy generally increases with increasing distance from immigration.  However, we also find that the third-plus generation breaks with the general pattern and is considerably more likely to marry endogamously than most of the more recent immigrant generation groups.  We show that this apparent anomaly is largely a function of the high proportion of Francophones  a population that is not only religiously homogeneous, but is also linguistically and geographically bounded  found among the third-plus generation.

Its contraceptive prevalence rates are collectively the worlds lowest and, unlike the rates in other developing regions, show no signs of increasing at the fastest rate. Only recently, the contraceptive prevalence rate has increased considerably in Kenya from 7 percent to 33 percent in 1993. According to Demographic and Health Surveys data, the contraceptive prevalence rate varies from 4 percent in Niger to 47 percent in Egypt. In this paper we will examine the comparative determinants of the choice of a contraceptive method among African women, using data primarily from the Demographic and Health Surveys. How people choose contraceptives affect many decisions. It affects which methods are appropriate for various subgroups in a population. It affects the degree of emphasis to be place on increasing service access and on changes for contraceptives and other services. It also affects promotional campaigns and the design of media materials. We will examine the determinants of the choice of a comparative method in Ghana, Kenya, Sudan, and Zimbabwe.

Two prominent issues surrounding cognitive social structures are the inference of the ""real"" network from the cognitive data and the predictors of accuracy; the latter refers to traits that make certain people have perceptions of network ties that closely match the ""real"" network and have included structural, demographic, and attitudinal variables of network actors.  The research presented in this paper raises some questions and concerns over both 1) the process of determining this ""real"" network and 2) previous findings on predictors of cognitive accuracy."
0	There exists a strong political divide on climate change in the U.S. general public, with political liberals expressing stronger pro-environmental attitudes and beliefs about climate change than their conservative counterparts.  Recent studies find a similar, though smaller political divide in the general publics of Australia and the United Kingdom.  Given its leadership in international climate policy-making, we extend this line of research to the European Union.  This is the first cross-national examination of a possible political divide on the issue of climate change.  Analyzing data from the 2008 Eurobarometer 69.2 survey, we examine the extent of a Left-Right divide on climate change attitudes, beliefs, willingness to pay, and policy support in the general publics of the 27 EU countries.  As expected, we find that citizens on the Left consistently report more pro-environmental beliefs, attitudes, and policy preferences on climate change than do citizens on the Right in ten Western European countries.  Though, this political divide is considerably smaller than that found in the United States in recent years.  Also as expected, in the general publics of almost all the Eastern European countries, there is no consistent, robust political divide on climate change.
1	Conventional wisdom suggests that when institutional logics overlap, the production of hybrids signifies collapse, blending, or easy coexistence. The author provides an alternative interpretation: hybrids can maintain a distinctive boundary and can emerge from contestation, not coexistence. This alternative interpretation is grounded in an analysis of a critical moment at the academic-commercial boundary: the enforcement of patents to a key technology on academic geneticists. In their reaction to commercial encroachment, skilled actors (scientists) took the resources of the commercial logic and transformed their meaning to establish hybrid strategies that preserved the distinctive institutions. Thus, hybrids must be reconsidered as emerging from conflict and produced through boundary work to maintain the distinction and resilience of logics.
0	This paper tests a hybrid of Melissa Rodericks work regarding the importance of the transition year to high school in predicting dropout and existing educational theory regarding the effectiveness of critical thinking pedagogy in order to determine the predictive ability of critical thinking pedagogy during ninth grade English and math classes towards graduation.  This is done using a mixed methods approach that examines correlations between teaching methods which encourage or inhibit critical thinking and dropout through logistic regression models using data from the Philadelphia Educational Longitudinal Study (PELS), and qualitatively links methods examined in the quantitative section to pedagogy the sample of Philadelphia ninth-grade students find effective.  The quantitative results provide strong evidence that methods which inhibit critical thinking are predictive of dropout.  The quantitative results also make suggestive connections between discussion in class, an aspect of critical thinking, and graduation.  The qualitative results link the methods that inhibit critical thinking to the pedagogy of poverty, as well as link in-class discussion to critical thinking pedagogy, which students find effective in creating attachment to school, confirming the quantitative findings.  Implications for educational theory are discussed.
1	Maternity leave policies are designed to ease the tension between women's employment and fertility, but whether they actually play such a role remains unclear. We analyze the individual-level effects of maternity leave on employment outcomes and on second conception rates among Russian first-time mothers from 1985-2000 using retrospective job and fertility histories from the Survey of Stratification and Migration Dynamics in Russia. During this period Russia experienced tremendous economic and political turbulence, which many observers believed would undermine policies like maternity leave and otherwise adversely affect the situation of women. Nevertheless, we find that maternity leave helped women maintain a foothold in the labor market, even during the more turbulent post-transition period. Also, women who took extended leave (6-36 months) in connection with a first birth had elevated rates of second conceptions after they returned to the workforce.
1	Using data from the 2003 and 2004 American Time Use Surveys, this article examines nonstandard work hours and their relationship to parents' family, leisure and personal care time - informing the discussion of the costs and benefits of working nonstandard hours. The results suggest that parents who work nonstandard evening hours spend less time in some child-related activities than their counterparts who work standard daytime hours, but spend more time and more time alone with children. Married parents who work nonstandard hours spend less time with a spouse, and all parents with nonstandard hours get less sleep and watch less television than parents with standard work days.
1	Using data on married women from the sixth survey wave of the Marital Instability over the Life Course (2000, N = 489), we examine the influence of mattering, or the extent to which wives believe they are important to their husbands, on wives' perceptions of fairness of the division of household labor. Mattering taps into wives' beliefs about their husbands' supportiveness of them, as evidenced by respect, concern, and appreciation. We find that the more wives believe they matter to their husbands, the more likely they are to report the division of housework is fair, regardless of the share of housework wives perform, time availability, relative resources, and gender role attitudes. This research contributes to prior work on wives' perceived fairness of the division of household labor by demonstrating the salience of broader emotional dynamics in the marriage. 
0	Using the case of feminist and conservative opposition to pornography, I show how opposed groups with a shared similar goal interact with each other, distinguish between themselves and their opponent, influence each other, and disparately influence outcome depending on political context and power.  When activists make demands on the state, they may be drawn into relationships with foes making related demands.  These relationships are shaped not only by the actions of each movement, but by the power, bureaucratic routines, and discourses of the state.  While the outcomes of such relationships may include partial achievement of goals for either or both parties, they also shape both movements’ internal composition and their alliances within their own broader movements.  These relationships have substantial implications for the coalitions that make up broad-based social movements.
0	Using data from a national survey of Arab-American women, this paper examines the extent to which family behavior mediates the influence of religion on womens labor force activity.  Prior research on the family has largely overlooked the role of religion in influencing womens labor force decisions, particularly at different stages of the life cycle.  The analysis begins to address this gap by examining whether religious affiliation and religiosity have direct relationships with womens work behaviors, or if they primarily operate through family behaviors at different phases of the life course.  The results find that religiosity exerts a negative influence on womens labor force participation but only when children are present in the home.  Among women with no children, religiosity has an insignificant impact on employment.
0	This paper describes some current issues in Internet research ethics that are specifically relevant to sociological research and research ethics. While the standard research ethics apply to many research issues using the Internet, new issues are arising that are specific to the Internet. These issues are presented in a non-technical format and aimed towards developing practical solutions to the ethical problems raised. As the Internet becomes increasingly important part of social structure, sociologists will be expected to do more research on its impact. Through the development of updated ethical guidelines that reflect the nature of the Internet, sociologists will be better able to conduct theoretical and applied research on the Internet.
1	Past research recognizes that firms exploit regulatory variations to their advantage but depicts such regulatory arbitrage as a dyadic process between firms and regulators. We extend this account by including a firm's non-market rivals and suggest that firms view regulatory differences as part of a corporate political opportunity structure and exploit regulatory variations to disadvantage their rivals. Empirically, we focus on variations in right-to-work (RTW) laws that signal the pro-business climate in a state; these laws exist in 22 U.S. states. Using a spatial-regression discontinuity design, we analyze how Walmart locates new stores in the face of anti-Walmart activists and exploits regulatory discontinuities on the borders between RTW and non-RTW states. We find that Walmart is more likely to propose new stores, and to open those stores even if they are protested, at the borders of RTW states, compared with the borders of neighboring non-RTW states. We conclude with a discussion of implications for the study of regulation, social movements, and organizations.
0	The transformation of fluid factional politics into stable party politics remains a pressing problem, but it involves processes not well understood.  This paper suggests it is possible in conjunction with certain transformations in underlying elite social networks, particularly when political allegiances come no longer to crosscut other kinds of social network connections.  Such a transformation can have the effect of giving traditional political cultural practices new meanings that are conducive to healthier, more principled forms of political mobilization.  I call this approach to the problem of political transformation a networks and culture approach. A case is made for this model using marital and office-holding network data from late eighteenth century Poland, together with a narrative that documents political mobilization and recruitment activity over a thirty year period.
0	Despite the fact that many feminists argued that globalization has negatively affected women’s social, political, and economic status, the understanding on the effect of economic globalization on women’s paid work varies. The purpose of this paper is to find out how individuals perceive economic globalization and build their understanding of the effect of globalization on the basis of their background. Based on the idea that there is no single effect of globalization on women and work, this paper specifically questions how women, work, and globalization is perceived by female university students in Korea. Using in-depth interviews, I explored how female university students who are about to graduate view the influence of globalization on women’s paid work in their local labor market. The result indicates that Korean female university students believed that economic globalization gives a better opportunity to work in women-friendly multinational corporations and affects male-dominant conservative Korean companies to improve their company culture. They thought that flexibilization of labor market and increase of unstable work status for women was not a big problem. I explain the causes of such perception based on the social and economic status of these female university students and on the positive framing of global leader and globalization by Korean universities. The implication of these findings on inequality among women in not only their daily economic status but also their cultural perception is discussed.
1	This paper evaluates how the distribution of applicant and enrollee attributes at seven Texas universities changed after the Hopwood decision and the implementation of a policy guaranteeing admission to students with high class ranks. We analyze changes in the distributions of test scores and high school class ranks for underrepresented minority groups as well as white and Asian American applicants across institutions and between admission regimes. We show that these admissions policy changes, which have direct effects on only the most selective institutions, have substantial indirect effects at other institutions. Average test scores of applicants to less selective institutions rose following the change in admission criteria, as students with high test scores who did not qualify for the admission guarantee applied to a broader set of institutions. Furthermore, as the share of high rank applicants at UT-Austin rose, the pre-Hopwood assent in the test scores of their applicants stagnated.

1	A debate within the mortality literature centers around the impact of health behaviors on the prospects of disadvantaged groups. Meanwhile, a growing body of work illustrates the social processes that shape changes in smoking levels by socioeconomic status (SES), especially educational attainment. These literatures are merged by examining the mediating effects of cigarette smoking on education gaps in U.S. adult mortality by age and gender. Findings reveal that cigarette smoking is an important mediator of the education-mortality gap for all males and for younger females. In particular, education-mortality gaps for young men narrow considerably when cigarette smoking is accounted for, while older women experienced no reduction in the education-mortality gap with controls for smoking. These results are consistent with diffusion arguments that describe SES differences in smoking adoption by age and gender and provide strong evidence that smoking is an important differentiator of mortality risks by education. 
0	Sustainability has become a “key term” in contemporary policy discourse, a concept with significance for practice and policy, but ambiguous connotations and contested definitions. We draw on scholarship in cognitive anthropology to analyze sustainability as a cultural category (Atran, Medin, & Ross, 2005; D'Andrade, 1995). Cultural categories are conventions developed by cultural groups for labeling and grouping sets of objects, practices, actors, situations and other social experiences (Douglas, 1986). The extent of consensus over what it means to be sustainable affects the ability to cooperate on global issues, such as climate change and energy policy. We examine two questions: 1 – what is the conventional meaning structure of the term sustainability? 2 – what is the extent of consensus in beliefs about sustainability across countries? Our primary data is a corpus of 8,000 news articles published in 2010 in the 21 countries. We use computer aided text analysis and cultural consensus modeling (Romney, Moore, Batchelder, & Hsia, 2000), to assess if there is an overall (meta-cultural) consensus about what people categorize as sustainability (there could be no consensus), and whether there are distinct subcultures with greater consistency in their beliefs (there may be none). Based on documenting these descriptive differences, we then theorize the institutional, cultural, material and political reasons for similarities and differences. We close by discussing the implications of different cultural understandings.

1	Public opinion polarization is here conceived as a process of alignment along multiple lines of potential disagreement and measured as growing constraint in individuals' preferences. Using NES data from 1972 to 2004, the authors model trends in issue partisanship the correlation of issue attitudes with party identification-and issue alignment-the correlation between pairs of issues-and find a substantive increase in issue partisanship, but little evidence of issue alignment. The findings suggest that opinion changes correspond more to a resorting of party labels among voters than to greater constraint on issue attitudes: since parties are more polarized, they are now better at sorting individuals along ideological lines. Levels of constraint vary across population subgroups: strong partisans and wealthier and politically sophisticated voters have grown more coherent in their beliefs. The authors discuss the consequences of partisan realignment and group sorting on the political process and potential deviations from the classic pluralistic account of American politics.
1	"Studies examining determinants of divorce have largely ignored differences between factors that elevate wives' and husbands' initiation of divorce. The authors use longitudinal data and a latent class model embedded in a competing-risks event history model to assess distinct predictors of wives and husbands leaving marriages. They find that when men are not employed, either spouse is more likely to leave. When wives report better-than-average marital satisfaction, their employment affects neither spouse's exit. However, when wives report below-average marital satisfaction, their employment makes it more likely they will leave. The authors' findings suggest that theories of divorce require ""gendering"" to reflect asymmetric gender change."
0	Using data from the NELS:2000 and PETS, I assess the levels of economic, cultural, human, social, and informational capital possessed by first-generation college students and their non-first-generation peers.  I analyze the effects these forms of capital have on enrollment in and persistence through a four-year postsecondary education and on undergraduate grade point averages, and determine whether capital has a greater effect on non-first-generation students (the reproduction model), first-generation students (the mobility model), or neither group.  All forms of capital are less common among first-generation than non-first-generation students.  When analyzed separately, each form of capital significantly and positively affects four-year college enrollment, bachelors degree attainment, and undergraduate grade point average, but in models where all five forms of capital are included together, cultural capital does not affect any outcome, and informational capital does not affect GPA.  In the final models, first-generation status loses its negative effect on four-year college enrollment and graduation, and has a positive effect on undergraduate GPA. Informational capital interacts positively with first-generation status for enrollment in and graduation from a bachelors degree program, lending support to the mobility model, while social capital interacts negatively with first-generation status for graduation and GPA, indicating support for the reproduction model.
1	This article adopts an institutional approach to describe the changing secondary market for life insurance in the United States. Since the 1990s, this market, in which investors buy strangers' life insurance policies, has grown in the face of considerable moral ambivalence. The author uses news reports and interviews to identify and describe three conceptions of this market: sacred revulsion, consumerist consolation, and rationalized reconciliation. Differences among the conceptions are considered in view of the institutional legacy of life insurance and its success in organizing practices, perceptions, and understandings about markets and death. From this case, the author draws implications for analyses of morals in markets, an important and emergent topic within economic sociology.
0	This article uses data from one hundred and fifty semi-structured interviews from subjects in the US and UK. I find that the primary identities of second generation immigrants in the UK are strongly shaped by their parents’ cultures. US subjects were more likely to identify as American or Nigerian-American, while UK subjects were extremely unlikely to identify as British or Nigerian-British. Systemic discrimination and a national British narrative that depicts blacks as aliens to the white motherland are the main drivers for this finding. I found that the narratives used by African immigrants to describe Afro-Caribbeans, their proximal hosts in the UK, and African-Americans, their proximal hosts in the US, were extremely similar. Proximal hosts are the group the receiving country will assign the immigrants (Mittelberg and Waters 1992). I argue that identities at the micro level are shaped by an interaction between three actors; the individuals and their cognitive maps, the wider society, and their proximal hosts. Gender differences in identity choices and relations with proximal hosts were also observed. My contribution to the literature is making a theoretical argument as to why Afro-Caribbeans in the UK and African-Americans in the US are treated in the same ways. I also find the emergence of a nascent pan-ethnic African identify among African immigrants in the UK.
1	This article examines social stratification in individual health trajectories for multiple cohorts in the context of China's dramatically changing macro-social environment. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we find significant socioeconomic status (SES) differences in the mean level of health and that these SES differentials generally diverge over the life course. We also find strong cohort variations in SES disparities in the mean levels of health and health trajectories. The effect of education on health slightly decreases across successive cohorts. By contrast, the income gap in health trajectories diverges for earlier cohorts but converges for most recent cohorts. Both effects are more pronounced in rural areas. Given that these cohort effects are opposite those reported in recent U.S. studies, we discuss China's unique social, economic, and political settings. We highlight the association between SES and health behaviors, China's stage of epidemiologic transition, and the changing power of the state government and its implications for health care.
0	In 1989 the American Psychological Association began developing and implementing strategies to gain prescription privileges for clinical psychologists. These efforts have resulted in the passing of legislative proposals granting clinical psychologists the right to prescribe in two states. Psychiatry has challenged this agenda since its inception. The result has been a heated turf dispute between the two professional specialties. To clarify the dispute and uncover the claims and concerns each specialty uses to advance its case I conducted a content analysis of the professional specialties newsletters. I utilized Abbotts (1988) system of profession framework and the professional dominance perspective to inform my analysis .  I show that prescription rights advocates base their arguments on the claim that clinical psychologists are already highly involved with prescription practices through their collaboration with medical doctors, and on their concern of providing access to rural populations. Psychiatrists dispute the validity of both of these arguments.  My research provides strong evidence that the struggle over professional expertise and authority is at the center of the debate. I also provide grounds for the expansion of Abbotts framework to include disputes between professional specialties.
0	The multifaceted plight of teenage parents receives attention from the media and social scientists.  We investigate the processes that contribute to young parents depressed mood, with a focus on gender differences.  We believe the effects of early parenthood on depressed mood in young adulthood will vary by gender, because selection into and the life course consequences of early parenting will differ by gender.  We use longitudinal data from the Youth Development Study, based on a random sample of over 1,000 adolescents living a Midwestern city.  Younger mothers (< 20 years old at first birth) had higher levels of depressed mood in young adulthood than young fathers, and males or females who are later parents (between the ages of 20 and 30) or who are not yet parents.  Selection is the primary contributor to young mothers higher levels of depressed mood compared to early parent males, as early parent females were more likely to be depressed in adolescence.  Furthermore, life course consequences of early parenting lead to higher levels of depressed mood among early female parents when compared to later parents or non-parents.  Financial strain, traumatic life events and a diminished sense of control played the largest role in explaining these differences.
0	Protest policing scholars have theorized a general decline in more coercive police tactics since the 1960s. Unfortunately, few studies directly examine the evolution of protest control to gauge the empirical support for this pattern. To address this gap in the literature, we use semiparametric logistic regression analysis to examine patterns in police presence, the use of arrests, and the use of force at over 15,000 protests covered by the New York Times between 1960 and 1995. Using a nonparametric operationalization of time, we systematically assess how protest policing has changed, and whether the trends we observe are similar across each of the tactics we examine. While our results confirm that there has been an absolute decline in more heavy-handed policing, there are different evolutionary logics for each police tactic we investigate. In addition, our results raise the possibility that an overall decrease in more coercive protest control may simply be a function of lower levels of police presence at protest events, and not necessarily due to the development of a more amicable protest management strategy.
1	Income inequality has been increasing in the United States, and intraoccupational processes are partly responsible (Kim and Sakamoto 2008; Mouw and Kalleberg 2010). To date, scholars have focused on suboccupational divisions, such as specialty areas, to understand why some members of an occupation earn more than others. In this article we theorize, operationalize, and assess the economic effect of another way in which members of the same profession can be distinguished: by the extent to which they specialize. Using two large secondary datasets on lawyers in the United States, we find that lawyers who specialize earn more. This effect arises partly through two mechanisms-individual productivity and firm size-and depends upon specialty area prestige: lawyers in low-prestige areas actually benefit more from specializing.
0	The domestic nuclear power industry is poised to expand in response to the high costs of traditional energy sources coupled with their damaging affects on the environment.  This expansion will create a significant paradigm shift in antinuclear social movements from complete oppositionto an emphasis on nuclear security and safety along with storage of high-level nuclear waste.  This paradigm shift requires radical revision of repertoire, master frame, strategy, and redefinition of social movement success.  The execution of this paradigm shift is dependent on the effective use of social networks via the internet and the dynamic communication between major network actors, activists, whistleblowers, and expertsespecially during the shortened licensing stage of new nuclear plants..  Using facets of Network Theory, the authors initially scrutinize multiple aspects of old and emerging antinuclear power movement with emphasis on network building and repertoire framing in dealing with the public and policy makers.  Readers will be provided an objective preview of the polemic that will likely occur in the near future as the America proceeds with the new nuclear power option
1	Recent studies have sparked lively debates about White working class voting in the U.S. On one hand, there is evidence that the White working class has shifted to vote Republican, and on the other hand, there is evidence that the White working class continues to vote Democratic. Using the American National Elections Studies (ANES), we examine 32 years of presidential election results (1972-2004). We utilize theoretically justifiable measures of routine white collar, skilled and unskilled workers, which we then combine into broad and restricted measures of the White working class. Also, we distinguish between the male and female White working class and consider a variety of other predictors of vote choice. We scrutinize the entire period as a whole, each election year individually, and then concentrate on the 1996-2004 elections. In the entire period, the odds that White Working class men voted Republican were greater by a factor of about 1.35. By contrast, White working class women were not significantly different from the electorate. Yet, this conceals temporal variation. Although the White working class was more Republican than the general electorate in 1972 and 1984, and more Democratic in 1976, the White working class generally was consistent with the electorate through 1992. Since 1996, there has been a sharp divergence between the male and female White working class. Men very strongly supported Republicans 1996-2004, while there is some evidence women supported Democrats in 1996 and 2004 (but not 2000). From 1996-2004, the odds White working class men voted Republican were greater by a factor of about 2.0. These patterns are not confined to the South and hold despite controls for a variety of predictors of vote choice. 
0	Traditionally citizenship is a dichotomous concept, defining a person with citizenship as being a legally recognized member of state, while a non-citizen is a not legally recognized.  While the literature provides clarity by conceptualizing citizenship as a fairly constant dichotomy, I argue that citizenship is something fluid. Therefore I am attempting to focus and suggest that citizenship is more than just belonging or not belonging to a state, and additionally belonging and not belonging is never constant, but always fluctuating.  I will analyze interviews conducted in two federal prisons in Texas of Mexican migrants who are tagged for deportation in order to re-conceptualize our understanding of what it means to belong and not belong within a state.l
1	Scholars have long argued that civic organizations play a vital role in developing members' civic capacity. Yet few empirical studies examine how and the extent to which civic skills transfer across distinct and separate civic contexts. Focusing on Latino immigrant members of a Los Angeles janitors' labor union, this article fills a void by investigating union members' involvement in an independent civic arena-their children's schools. Analyses of random sample survey and semi-structured interview data demonstrate that labor union experience does not simply lead to more civic engagement, as previous research might suggest. Rather, conceptual distinctions must be made between active and inactive union members and between different types of civic engagement. Results show that active union members are not particularly involved in plug-in types of involvement, which are typically defined and dictated by school personnel. Instead, active union members tend to become involved in critical forms of engagement that allow them to voice their interests and exercise leadership. Furthermore, findings suggest that the problem solving, advocacy, and organizing skills acquired through union participation do not uniformly influence members' civic engagement. Experience in a social movement union serves as a catalyst for civic engagement for some, while it enhances the leadership capacity of others.

This study seeks to expand our knowledge of black immigrant cultural assimilation by examining a random sample of black immigrants from many different countries in contrast to previous studies based on predominantly snowball samples of immigrants from English-speaking Caribbean countries. In this study, I explore the effects of socioeconomic status, length of time in the United States, English language ability, citizenship status, country of origin/ ethnicity, educational attainment, skin tone, and neighborhood context on these two dimensions of racial identity. I found significant differences in both common fate and perceptions of discrimination by length of time in the United States and country of origin.  In addition, different factors were found to predict each dimension of cultural assimilation. The extent to which foreign-born blacks identify with native-born blacks is significantly influenced by country of origin, time spent in the United States, educational attainment, English language ability, gender, and socioeconomic status net of other factors.  In contrast, countries of origin and time in the United States are the only two significant predictors of black immigrants perceptions of discrimination controlling for all other factors.  These results suggest that there is a great deal of variation in the cultural assimilation of black immigrants, and future research is needed to further explore the patterns of incorporation among different groups of black immigrants.
1	Using a sample of continuously-married individuals (793 women and 847 men) and their spouses drawn from the first two waves of the NSFH, we examine change in individuals' attitudes about mothers' employment. We investigate hypotheses derived from three models of attitude change: the exposure model, the interest-based model, and the control model. We find support for hypotheses derived from ail three. Consistent with exposure hypotheses, the adoption of fundamentalist beliefs reduces egalitarianism, while spouses' egalitarianism and spouses' education are positively related to individuals' own egalitarianism. As predicted in both exposure and interest hypotheses, women's entry into employment is positively related to women's egalitarianism, while wives' occupational prestige is positively related to men's egalitarianism. Congruent with the interest model, the presence of a young child is positively associated with women's egalitarianism. Consistent with the exposure model, the number of children in the home reduces men's egalitarianism, and a traditional division of housework decreases women's egalitarianism. Finally, consistent with the gender ideology discrepancy hypothesis, derived from the control model, individuals whose background, work, and family life are inconsistent with their gender ideology at wave 1 shift their gender ideology at wave 2 in a direction that is more compatible with their background, work, and family life: egalitarians with traditional life patterns at wave I are more traditional in their gender ideology at wave 2, and traditionals with egalitarian life patterns at wave I are more egalitarian at wave 2. We discuss the implications of these patterns for larger scale change in gender ideology.

In particular, non-searching drives the glass escalator that moves men from female- to male-dominated settings.  Analyses drawing on NLSY data of women and men who changed jobs between 1996 and 1998 find that female and male job changers who start out in sex-typical jobs tend to move into jobs dominated by their own sex.  Non-searching increases female job changers odds of moving into a male-dominated versus neutral job, but the effects of non-searching on womens movement do not depend on the sex composition of their job of origin. In contrast, for men the odds of entering a male job without searching for work are greatest among those who were previously employed in a female job.  The findings have implications for understanding the role of the job search process in the maintenance of sex segregation at work.
1	"The inclusion of women in the US. military is generally understood as radically transforming traditional gender relations. Drawing from 38 interviews with women and men in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, I ask: how do women negotiate gender identities within the ""masculine"" military institution, and what types of transformations in their gender ideology and practices does this negotiation entail? I find that ROTC women's transformative agency is limited by the cultural imperative of performing gender. That is, because their very identities as women are called into question in the military sphere, ROTC women must privilege traditionally feminine aspects of themselves in order to maintain a coherent sense of self. Through this process, these women ultimately reproduce traditional femininity and male privilege."

Without reliable statistics the effects of these measures will not be known, and fears of Muslim radicalization can be exploited.  Despite these acknowledged concerns, research on the situation of Muslims in western democracies relies on mostly proxy data, referring to nationality and ethnicity (EUMC, 2006: 8; cf. OECD, 2007).  The European Commission (2005: 3) has initiated an effort toward the systematic production of harmonized Community statistics, admittedly confined for now to just such proxy data, but with a view to improving knowledge of immigrants socioeconomic integration in the long term.  Our paper examines data available on the integration of Muslims in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Britainand, as a non-EU point of comparison, the United States.  We consider the available data and their comparability, investigating not only the interests and misgivings of EU member states concerning the collection of these data in the purely domestic context, but also the influence of their European policy agendas on harmonization efforts.
1	We utilize the 2000 Equal Employment Opportunity file of the US. Census and various secondary resources to determine if party control, union density and states' anti-discrimination and family leave policy legacies affect levels of occupational sex segregation across large counties. Our findings offer a puzzle to political sociologists because two theories that are typically pitted against one another (Power Resource Theory vs. Liberal Economic Theory) predict and result in comparable outcomes. Indeed, as suggested by Social Democratic Theory, the sub-national United States have lower levels of occupational sex segregation when the Democratic Party and unions are strong, and policies are the mechanism through which these states maintain low occupational sex segregation. Yet, interestingly, as suggested by Liberal Economic Theory, occupational sex segregation is also low when unions and the Democratic Party are both weak, suggesting that unfettered market capitalism redresses socio-economic inequalities.
1	Most studies that attempt to understand immigrant political incorporation focus on patterns of electoral participation and citizenship acquisition. Given that nearly 60 percent of the foreign-born population in the United States is comprised of noncitizens, we argue that past studies miss an important dimension of the immigrant political incorporation process. In this article, we move beyond the ballot by documenting patterns of immigrant protest and conducting an analysis of the conditions under which immigrant organizing occurs in traditional gateways and new destinations. In addition to political opportunities and resources, we argue that conditions heightening group boundaries between immigrants and natives-what we call boundary markers-should play an important role in encouraging immigrants to develop a shared minority status and make collective claims on behalf of the larger group. Using hurdle models, we test our theoretical ideas with a new data set comprised of over 200 immigrant protest events in 52 metropolitan areas across the United States. Our results challenge past studies of immigrant mobilization because we find that inclusionary contexts characterized by greater access to formal political and economic incorporation both hinder and facilitate immigrant organizing, while boundary markers-measured here as threats and segregation-tend to encourage immigrant protest. Keywords: immigrant political incorporation, protest, collective action, new destinations.
0	Using support from the literature and preliminary data from my multiyear ethnographic work with Mexican adolescents and their families, I explore the construction of the norm of the immigrant bargain, the expectation that children will redeem the sacrifices made in the immigration of their parents. I move from the idea of an immigrant bargain to the concept of the immigrant bargain as a lens through which to develop important subject-centered understandings of the migration experience, left out in segmented assimilation theory. The intergenerational immigrant family narrative, a key addition to families’ cultural toolkits, is theorized as a key component of the immigrant bargain, which explains much of the relative educational success and optimism of the children of immigrants. Family narratives emerge during children’s adolescence, as the teenage sense of self surfaces. Structures manifest in the decision to emigrate—including expectations of advantage, humility, acknowledgement of the relative hardship of co-nationals and the importance of power of family cohesion—are theorized to combine with a dual frame of reference to produce a strong foundation for an intergenerational story of redemption. Children of immigrants select from their bicultural toolkit to construct a family narrative that aspires to social mobility. This subject-centered perspective on the importance of family narratives resonates with much current immigration, family, and narrative and social psychological theory. Future directions for research are outlined to assess its potential application.
0	"Although U.S. environmental breast cancer activists have been concerned with numerous types of toxins, in the mid 1990s they became especially interested in a group of chemicals called endocrine disrupters. These homone mimicking chemicals are believed to cause breast cancer and an array of other conditions afflicting women, men, children and wildlife. In this paper, I discuss how breast cancer activists interest in ""endocrine disrupter theory"" have led them to construct ""disease kinships"" between breast cancer and this array of disorders afflicting other human and non-human populationsspecifically children, men, and wildlifeas well as the earth itself  I also highlight how, and to what extent, activists efforts on behalf of these other populations differ; whereas activists have done much to protect the health of children, they have done less to promote the health of men, wildlife and the earths natural resources.  Such differences demonstrate that activists disease-kinship building is not just a biological and scientific process, but also a cultural, political and ideological one."
0	This paper reviews work on transnational activism and attempts to bridge the divide between international relations, social movement and world polity perspectives on transnational mobilization.  We provide a new perspective on transnational linkages focusing on the interactions of social movement communities in movement campaigns.  To conceptualize the emergence and maintenance of transnational movements, we identify three types of movement communities: professional communities, grassroots communities, and conscience communities, which are differentiated on bases of location and repertoire.  We argue that these imagined communities are all critical to the construction of transnational social movement communities and campaigns.  Based on this approach, research is needed to show how different types of movement communities are activated by campaigns, what parts they play in the mobilization and outcomes of campaigns, and how linkages are created and maintained among these communities.
1	"Despite the international growth of the service sector an industrial paradigm defines the study of global labor. This is because analyses of service work typically focus on firms in the United States, while studies of global labor concentrate on manufacturing. I develop a framework for analysis of global service work by comparing ethnographic cases of labor in two global, luxury hotels in China. Each hotel is linked to the same US.-based global corporation, and both employ the same organizational template and recruit same aged female workers. At the first hotel, workers silently cater to the preferences of guests, using recorded customer preference data and enacting imported feminized practices, a labor regime I call virtual personalism. At the second hotel, workers promote hotel products, displaying expertise to distinguish themselves from sex workers who frequent the hotel, a labor regime I call virtuous professionalism. Why do distinctly gendered labor practices emerge in the two settings? To explain the divergent regimes of labor I show that firms institutionalize localized consumer status struggles through the gendered organization of interactive labor. Workers 'interactive strategies and local workplace legacies mediate the forms institutionalism takes. I call the entwining of consumer markets and labor practices ""market-embedded labor."""
0	The movement of women out of the domestic sphere and into the labor force has redefined social expectations in both the occupational milieu and the traditionally gender segregated domestic sphere.  However, Arlie Hochschilds groundbreaking work on the unpaid second shift of housework performed by women after a paid shift in the occupational sphere suggests that little has changed about womens work at home despite tremendous shifts in paid labor participation.  This stalled revolution of the unequal division of household labor leaves working women with the primary responsibility for almost all household chores.  This paper examines the effects of gendered work on household involvement by examining the workplace sex ratio. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Young Women, I suggest that women who labor in nontraditional, mostly-male jobs experience less domestic investment in unpaid labor hours than women in female-dominated occupations.
1	Several studies have analyzed the impact of obesity on occupational standing. This study extends previous research by estimating the influence of body mass on occupational attainment over three decades of the career using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. In a series of covariance structure analyses, we considered three mechanisms that may alter the career trajectories of heavy individuals: (1. employment-based discrimination, (2. educational attainment, and (3. marriage market processes. Unlike previous studies, we found limited evidence that employment-based discrimination impaired the career trajectories of either men or women. Instead, we found that heavy women received less post-secondary schooling than their thinner peers, which in turn adversely affected their occupational standing at each point in their careers.
0	Building on neo-institutionalist theories of organizations and political-cultural theories of markets, I suggest here that economic sociologists need to identify and analyze meso-level institutions of routine cultural production for economic action, and that the previously neglected population of American business associations should be understood as just such an institution. Analyzing evidence from the public discourse of twenty six representative business associations (non-profit organizations of profit-oriented economic actors) I argue that their meaning-making includes  (1) the cultural production of industries (2) the articulation of collective identities beyond the aggregation of individual members interests (3) the articulation of cognitive categories and strategies of action within which members can locate their economic action (4) the production of industry norms and status orders (5) the production of networking opportunities (6) the production of camaraderie and (7) the constitution of a rich field of relations (both imaginary and active) with regulatory and standards bodies, similar international groups, upstream suppliers and downstream customers, academic research units, commercial industry services, and related business associations. The theory of American business associations as cultural produces challenges but encompasses previous assumptions that they may be simply understood as political interest groups, or as groups reducing industry transaction costs
1	To investigate the role of body size in social networks, this study estimated cross-nested multilevel network models (p) with longitudinal data from the 16 saturated schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. As body mass index increased, the likelihood of being nominated by schoolmates as friends - but not the likelihood of nominating others as friends decreased. This trend was more pronounced among girls. Moreover, similarity in body mass index strongly predicted friendship formation. These findings were not explained by correlates (e.g., academic achievement) of both body size and friendship dynamics. Thus, the connection between body size and high school social relations was largely a function of the stigmatization of heavier body sizes, especially for girls, and of homophily.
1	This study draws on the literature on political opportunity structures to investigate the effects of local and national factors on the Zapatista cycle of protest from 1994 to 2003. A cross-sectional, timeseries, negative binomial model for event counts is used to analyze the ebb and flow of Zapatista protests across the 111 municipios ( municipalities) of Chiapas during this 10-year period. The results show that while all types of demands appear to have been significant triggers of protest activity, Zapatistas concentrated their protest events in larger and more closed localities that had a history of protest activity, stable elite alignments, and a larger military presence. Openings in the political system at the local and national levels lessened protest activity in the more democratic scenarios. These results suggest that the curvilinear relationship between the structure of political opportunities and protest mobilization posited to explain social movements in well-developed Western democracies does not explain the development of the protest cycle of a new social movement in an emerging electoral democracy.
0	Substantial evidence indicates that marital disruption is associated with declines in psychological well-being. Despite the well-known negative association between marital disruption and psychological well-being, it is less known about whether or not motherhood alters this association. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we select women who are married at the baseline to compare the effects of motherhood on changes in the levels of psychological well-being among the divorced and widowed women during the follow-up period with those of the continuously married since the baseline interview. Consistent with the previous literature, our results show that marital disruption increases the depressive symptoms overall especially for the divorced. However, the childless divorced do not appear to be disadvantaged. On the other hand, the childless widowed experience the most vulnerability. Differences in the processes of marital disruption partly explain these variations.
0	Immigrants are essential to the operation of all neighborhoods in New York City.  However, while nearly forty percent of the city’s population is foreign-born and immigrants work in all occupational sectors and neighborhoods, most immigrants tend to be less integrated residentially.  This paper examines the extent to which immigrants are represented, both visually and occupationally, in the neighborhoods in which they work.  The study focuses on two neighborhoods: an affluent and largely native-born community and an immigrant enclave, using comparative observational and data analysis and community mapping.  Despite the residential and socioeconomic distinction between the two areas, they are similar in that they are major commercial areas with a large number of restaurants, stores, and services and, additionally, are each the center of employment for many immigrants.  However, immigrant representation differs in terms of services provided and overall representation of the large immigrant population of the city.  While immigrants are well-represented and catered to in the ethnic enclave, they are almost an invisible population in the affluent neighborhood despite the large concentration of immigrants who work and spend much of their time there and are critical to the neighborhood’s existence.  Instead, there consumption of “ethnic” products, such as art, food, and entertainment, remains largely symbolic and inauthentic, catering to native-born residents rather than the local immigrant workforce.  The extent to which immigrants are represented in a community reflects how well they are incorporated on the neighborhood level, which can ultimately influence their incorporation into the larger society.
1	This study examines the consequences for psychological well-being of marital stability and change over the five-year period between the two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households. We develop and test the following hypotheses: (1) those who divorce or separate experience declines in psychological well-being compared to those who remain married; (2) among those unhappy with their marriage, those who divorce or separate see improvements in psychological well-being, especially if they remarry, compared to those who remain married to the same person; (3) psychological well-being declines in the first year or two following the end of the marriage and then improves to previous levels: (4) women experience greater improvements in psychological well-being from leaving an unhappy marriage than do men. We find strong and consistent support only for the first of these. 
1	A substantial body of research has explored the extent to which the race of offenders and victims influences who receives a death sentence for capital crimes. Little is known about how race and ethnicity might pattern death-row outcomes. Drawing upon evidence from male offenders sentenced to death in Texas during the years 1974 through 2009, we extend recent research by examining whether the race and ethnicity of offenders and victims and a number of offender, victim, and crime attributes influence the likelihood of executions and sentence relief (whereby prisoners leave death row). Cox regression analyses are used in conjunction with a multiple-imputation method for handling a modest amount of missing data. The results show that cases involving minorities-with black or Latino offenders or victims-have lower hazards of execution than cases in which both offenders and victims are white. Victim and offender race and ethnicity have little to no independent effect upon the hazard of sentence relief. Keywords: capital punishment, executions, sentence relief, race, Latinos.
1	Organizational de-coupling occurs when organizational adoption of programs is separated from ongoing activities Neo-institutional theory asserts it is an effective coping strategy for modern organizations to deal with increasingly elaborated environments In this paper we investigate the consequences of organizational de-coupling from an inward-looking within organizational perspective Specifically we study how the de-coupling of flexible work program affects workers actualization of productivity Our data analysis suggests that the organizational de-coupling in which organizations only ceremonially adopt flexible work program without making it available to all workers, is detrimental to the actualization of productivity for workers who were bereft of the opportunity In contrast we find that the highest level of productivity actualization is associated with workers who enjoy a factual flexible work schedule which is nevertheless not formally adopted by the employer The implications of the findings are discussed 
0	Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS have increased among mature-aged women in recent years, with divorce and other life transitions being implicated as risk factors. In this qualitative study, in-depth interviews were used to examine the STI/HIV risks of women over 35 years old who began dating after marriage or a long-term relationship.  Using the sociology of the body as a theoretical framework, five themes generated from interview narratives were: how to meet sexual partners; sexual embodiment in transitional dating; dating risks and rules; repertoires for unprotected sex; and scripts and strategies for safer dating. The sudden loss of social status after leaving or losing a partner often complicated dating.  Dating scripts were framed by gender-power constructs of older women as caregivers, or as sexual risk-takers if their demeanor was viewed as age-inappropriate.  Womens own perceptions of HIV risk were framed in terms of unsafe (i.e. socially undesirable or abusive) partners rather than unprotected sex. Targeted messages on the HIV-related risks of post-relationship dating would be helpful for women in this transitional period of life.
0	Studies suggest that racial and ethnic minorities exhibit lower levels of social capital. Utilizing telephone survey data, this study examines the relationship of social capital among race/ethnic groups and geographic location in San Antonio, Texas.  Overall African Americans and Hispanics did not differ significantly from others in levels of social capital, although Hispanics were significantly associated with lower levels of bridging social networks and Hispanics in the Westside barrio exhibited less racial trust and social networks. Social capital in communities varies less by race/ethnicity and more by the greater diversity within communities.
0	The study of economic behavior has recently been invigorated by increasing scholarly attention to how social logics shape economic action. But current progress in sociological approaches to economic action has been held back by the lack of a conceptual framework that allows for theorizing across diverse contexts, which in turn enables the comparative testing of claims of generalizability. This paper addresses this conceptual gap by revisiting and extending the budgetary unit, a forgotten Weberian concept defined as a unit of economic activity primarily animated by non-capitalistic, social logics. I will argue that bringing the concept of budgetary units into sociological approaches to economic action strengthens theoretical capacity in three ways: 1) provides a framework for theoretical comparisons across diverse social contexts 2) provides a dynamic unit of analysis 3) draws attention to how social logics structure the distribution of resources and the provision of needs within economic units. The first part of the paper examines the benefits of the framework over concepts currently employed in the literature. The second part examines the original development of budgetary units within the body of Max Webers work. The potential of this theoretical framework is explored in greater depth in the third part of the paper using examples from diverse contexts.
0	In the last two decades, immigrants, and particularly Latino immigrant groups such as Mexicans, have begun to fan out across the country, initiating new immigrant-receiving areas at the same time that older ones are being altered by increased immigrant suburbanization.  These geographic shifts underscore the need for a more complete understanding of the role of social context in helping or hindering immigrants and their children.  The proposed study will explore the possibility that residential location directly alters the adaptive trajectories of Latino youth.  The focus will primarily be on neighborhood-level effects, specifically the size and nature of immigrant co-ethnic communities and the possibility that they could exert both beneficial (in the form of social control, adherence to sanctioned behaviors) and deleterious (adherence to oppositional culture) influences.  The data for this analysis will come from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS) and the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN).  Both surveys were designed as multilevel surveys and have never before been used in a project with an explicit focus on immigrant youth.
1	"Understanding how the idea of culture is mobilized in discursive contests is crucial for both theorizing and building multicultural democracies. To investigate this, I analyze a debate over whether we should relieve the ""cultural need"" for infibulation among immigrants by offering a ""nick"" in U.S. hospitals. Using interviews, newspaper coverage, and primary documents, I show that physicians and opponents of the procedure with contrasting models of culture disagreed on whether it represented cultural change. Opponents argued that the ""nick"" was fairly described as ""female genital mutilation"" and symbolically identical to more extensive cutting. Using a reified model, they imagined Somalis to be ""culture-bound""; the adoption of a ""nick"" was simply a move from one genital cutting procedure to another. Unable to envision meaningful cultural adaptation, and presupposing the incompatibility of multiculturalism and feminism, they supported forced assimilation. Physicians, drawing on a dynamic model of culture, believed that adoption of the ""nick"" was meaningful cultural change, but overly idealized their ability to protect Somali girls from both Somali and U.S. patriarchy. Unduly confident, they failed to take oppression seriously, dismissing relevant constituencies and their concerns."
0	Research on the role of masculine identities on violent crime is still in its infancy. This paper examines Richard Felsons work on the interplay between gender and crime and compares it to other theories of criminal behavior that acknowledge the role of masculine identities. Felson claims that the connection between gender and crime is mitigated by physical size. However, this assumes that size is determined by sex not gender norms. Consequently, it is argued that doing gender can account for a large portion of Felsons claim. Furthermore, it is argued that theorizing about masculine identities can be further improved by incorporating the intersection of race and class into the concept of gender identity. Thus, providing a clearer picture of how race, class and physical ability combine in the construction of masculinity and the decision of whether or not to resort to violence.
1	This article investigates the determinants of orgasm and sexual enjoyment in hookup and relationship sex among heterosexual college women and seeks to explain why relationship sex is better for women in terms of orgasm and sexual enjoyment. We use data from women respondents to a large online survey of undergraduates at 21 U.S. colleges and universities and from 85 in-depth interviews at two universities. We identify four general views of the sources of orgasm and sexual enjoyment-technically competent genital stimulation, partner-specific learning, commitment, and gender equality. We find that women have orgasms more often in relationships than in hookups. Regression analyses reveal that specific sexual practices, experience with a particular partner, and commitment all predict women's orgasm and sexual enjoyment. The presence of more sexual practices conducive to women's orgasm in relationship sex explains some of why orgasm is more common in relationships. Qualitative analysis suggests a double standard also contributes to why relationship sex is better for women: both men and women question women's (but not men's) entitlement to pleasure in hookups but believe strongly in women's (as well as men's) entitlement to pleasure in relationships. More attention is thus given to producing female orgasm in relationships.
0	We suggest that studying the state, women and terrorism would benefit from systematic research from the areas of deviance and social control, politics, the state and international law.   While the importance of a historical and cultural analysis is frequently acknowledged, most research on terrorism and women is narrow in scope, providing sweeping individual-oriented generalizations and reductionist chronologies.  The construction of terrorism, however,  is a critical part of the production of hegemony including specific conceptions of ideological/political boundaries and dominant historical narratives.  Though female participation in terrorism has historically been low, explanations accounting for this lack of participation are insufficient as research on women and terrorism is insufficient.  Today, interest in the involvement of women in terrorist activity is reappearing, especially since Muslim females appear to be increasingly used to carry out suicide attacks in the Middle East.  Though significantly less than men, women also have been involved in terrorist activity, and have even been in leadership positions.  More notable, however, is the fact that most womens struggles challenging the state throughout history are characterized by an absence of violence.  Terrorism is currently defined and widely understood as a particular type of (political) violence created by fanatical or psychologically abnormal individuals and groups who spread fear among innocent victims.  Terrorism, however,  is a manifestation of a much more complex societal construction, that of domination and hierarchy.  Here we suggest the importance of a more systematic understanding of terrorism and of womens participation in terrorism.
1	This article presents the first evidence based on a newly-compiled database of known lynch victims. Using information from the original census enumerators' manuscripts, we identify individual- and household-level characteristics of more than 900 black males lynched in 10 southern states between 1882 and 1929. First, we use the information for successfully linked cases to present a profile of individual- and household-level characteristics of a large sample of lynch victims. Second, we compare these characteristics with a randomly-generated sample of black men living in the counties where lynchings occurred. We use our findings from this comparative analysis to assess the empirical support for alternative theoretical perspectives on the selection of individuals as victims of southern mob violence. Third, we consider whether the individual-level risk factors for being targeted as a lynch victim varied substantially over time or across space. Our results demonstrate that victims were generally less embedded within the social and economic fabric of their communities than were other black men. This suggests that social marginality increased the likelihood of being targeted for lynching. These findings are generally consistent across decades and within different sociodemographic contexts.
0	This is a critical issue because this specific framework of disability is based upon narrow statutory interpretations from a socio-legal/medical framework rather than a civil rights framework.  This paper will address the critical interpretations of disability policy notably the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and its implications.  This paper is written in two parts: Part I will examine the (often unintended) consequences of policy through several court cases that continue to marginalize people with disabilities.  Part I will also explore theoretical analyses on disablism to explicate some possible influences of the formal and narrow endorsement of disability policy.  Part II introduces the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 as a response toward the ADA of 1990 to redefine disability policy frameworks.  The paper will suggest that the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 is a response to the federal courts’ redefining disability policy that depart from a narrow interpretation of disability, that is, a narrow socio-medical/legal framework that neglects the multifaceted sociocultural aspects of disability and the new Act is an attempt to redefine disability policy into a positive and diverse approach.  This is a positive step towards the right direction to better serve the needs and expectations of people with disabilities in America.
1	Much American research has shown that the effects of parental divorce and single parenthood on children are weaker among African Americans than among whites. So far, this moderator effect has not been studied in other societies. Are there also weaker effects of parental divorce and single parenthood for blacks in other countries? We answer this question by analyzing Caribbeans in the Netherlands. We analyze effects of parental divorce and separation on eight outcome indicators for children in adulthood and we compare these effects between Caribbeans and whites. We show that for Caribbeans there are no effects of parental divorce on own divorce, cohabitation, leaving home, and contact frequency with the father, much in contrast to the effects for whites. For socioeconomic outcomes, however, the effects are similar for Caribbeans and whites. 
0	The impact of social support systems, discrimination, and socioeconomic status, among others, are well known psychosocial mechanisms that play an integral role in race-based differences.  However, much of the work analyzing psychosocial well being in demographic studies focuses on a narrow range of indicators that are typically less psychologically driven. Taking these shortcomings into account, this roundtable is projected to provide a general overview of the impact of including personality in population-based studies.
0	In this paper we examine the link between parent-child relationships and the transition to parenthood.  We propose that parent-child relationships have an affective dimension that accelerates the transition to parenthood as these children become young adults themselves.  We also hypothesize a supportive dimension of parent-child relationships that leads to greater educational achievement in young adults, which would delay the transition to parenthood.  Using event-history models, we test these hypotheses with two datasets: the Intergenerational Panel Study of Parents and Children (IPSPC) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).  The results differ across datasets.  While educational experiences decrease the rate of parenthood in both datasets, these educational experiences are largely unrelated to parent-child relationships.  In the IPSPC, parent-child relationships increase the rate of parenthood once a suppressor effect of marriage is controlled.  In the Add Health, parent-child relationships consistently decrease the rate of parenthood in all models.  These disparate findings may be related to substantial differences in the target population of the two studies.
0	"Annalee Saxenian has argued that one of the reasons why Silicon Valley venture capital firms outperform their Route 128 counterparts is because a number of Silicon Valley VC firms partners have worked in the information technology (IT) industry before turning to venture capital whereas most of the partners of Route 128 VC firms have not.  While Saxenians account suggests that the number and quality of ties that VC firms have with the IT industry are positively related to their success level, it does not necessarily follow that IT experience automatically translates into VC expertise.  It probably does, however, translate into higher status levels, which in turn can lead to higher rates of success.  This suggests that, independent of prior performance, the ties that VC firms have (or do not have) with the IT industry are positively related to organizational status.  This paper presents a preliminary test of this thesis, using Asset Management Companys venture capital genealogy chart, ""West Coast Venture Capital  25 years,"" Thompson Financial Securities Data/Venture Economics VentureXpert database, and a series of ""Whos Who in Venture Capital"" reference books published between 1984 and 1987."
0	We relate trends in the proportions of stay-at-home father households with macroeconomic fluctuations and change in social norms regarding gender roles. Specifically, we suggest that during an economic downturn, stay-at-home father households become more prevalent; male spouses lose their job and female spouses become the sole earners of a household. Once the labor market recovers and unemployment rates decline, the proportion of stay-at-home father households also declines, but stays above pre-economic downturn levels. Thus, labor market conditions are associated with changes in division of household work. We test this proposition using CPS data from 1976-2009. We find an association between increased unemployment levels and the proportion of stay-at-home father households. In addition, each recession is associated with a boost in the proportion of stay-at-home father households in the population. Finally, the increase in stay-at-home father households is driven by an increase in fathers who choose to stay-home and are not forced to stay home (e.g., because of disability or inability to find work).
0	Evidence from a variety of sources suggests that African American children are more likely to display conduct problems than White children.  Such differences underscore the importance of research investigating the factors that place African American youth at risk for behavior problems. The present study investigates the extent to which exposure to racial discrimination increases the chances of an African American adolescent engaging in delinquent behavior.   Using data from a longitudinal study of approximately 700 African American children living in Georgia and Iowa, we begin by establishing a correlation between exposure to discrimination and delinquent behavior.  Next, based upon hypotheses derived from strain theory, we use SEM to test various hypotheses regarding the emotional and cognitive factors that mediate this association. For boys, the association between discrimination and delinquency was mediated by feelings of anger and depression and by the belief that aggression is a necessary interpersonal tactic.  The results were somewhat different for girls.  Although anger and depression mediated part of the effect of discrimination on delinquency, discrimination continued to display a small but significant direct effect.
0	Taking an identity work approach, I explore the negotiation of the imposed identity of “self-taught artists” by a group of Black painters, examining how they individually and collectively define each term to create narratives that integrate their life experiences with the imposed identity. I examine how the artists construct their self-image, the importance of their work, and their life experiences in this process.  Considering issues of race and cultural capital, these findings suggest broader trends as to how individuals negotiate imposed identities through constructing their own definitions of the labels based on their own experiences. More specifically, these self-taught artists defined the labels through claims of their independence in making a decent living, passion for improving their skills, and negotiated the identity through humor and storytelling, making the best of hard times and easing racial tension in the process.
1	This article examines the process of post-disaster recovery and rebuilding in New York City since 9/11 and in New Orleans since the Hurricane Katrina disaster (8/29). As destabilizing events, 9/11 and 8/29 forced a rethinking of the major categories, concepts and theories that long dominated disaster research. We analyze the form, trajectory and problems of reconstruction in the two cities with special emphasis on the implementation Of the Community Development Block Grant program, the Liberty Zone and the Gulf Opportunity Zone, and tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance and promote reinvestment. Drawing on a variety of data sources, we show that New York and New Orleans have become important laboratories for entrepreneurial city and state governments seeking to use post-disaster rebuilding as an opportunity to push through far-reaching neoliberal policy reforms. The emphasis on using market-centered approaches for urban recovery and rebuilding in New York and New Orleans should be seen not as coherent or sustainable responses to urban disaster but rather as deeply contradictory restructuring strategies that are intensifying the problems they seek to remedy.
0	An increasing share of the economy is organized around financial capitalism, where, in contrast to the past, capital market actors actively assert and manage their claims on wealth creation and distribution.  These new activities challenge prior assumptions of managerial capitalism found in the sociological and industrial relations literature.  In this paper, we focus on a set of pro-active intermediaries -- private equity funds –to illustrate new forms of wealth extraction and their implications for labor research.  We begin by examining the changes in the US regulatory environment that have allowed these financial intermediaries to emerge.  We then describe the prevailing private equity business model by drawing on case examples across different sectors of the economy; and we explain the implications of the business model for management and labor.  In the conclusion, we suggest several regulatory changes that could potentially limit the destructive outcomes of alternative investment activities.
1	This paper presents a new theoretical framework for the study of environmental consumption at the micro-level by building on concepts from classical sociological theory and recent macro-level studies of the environment. The framework emphasizes the local community context as an important determinant of environmental consumption. We test this framework with unique Micro-level data on consumption, household size, household affluence, and community context from Nepal, a setting in the midst of dramatic change in community organization, population size, and consumption behavior. The results of these tests are consistent with the hypothesis that local non-family organizations shift the consumption of environmental resources from direct to more indirect. We argue that the framework presented here is a useful early step toward more comprehensive micro-level models of environmental quality. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	There have been a few cross-national studies published that examine the determinants of threatened mammals species. However, these studies neglect insights from both unequal ecological exchange theory and world polity theory. We seek to address this gap in the literature using cross-national data for a sample of seventy-four nations to construct negative binomial regression models with the number of threatened mammal species as the dependent variable. In doing so, we find substantial support for unequal ecological exchange theory that flows of primary sector exports from poor to rich nations tend to increase the number of threatened mammals in poor nations. We also find support for world polity theory that environmental non-governmental organizations are associated with lower numbers of threatened mammals in poor nations. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, some policy implications, and possible directions for future research.
0	Causal arguments that take history seriously typically posit a critical juncture when cases begin to travel divergent pathways. Heeding the methodological advice to avoid infinite regress, historically oriented political scientists and sociologists rarely pay systematic attention to events and conditions preceding this critical juncture. We argue that scholars should be more mindful of what we call critical antecedents: antecedent conditions that help activate a causal process during a critical juncture. A review of leading comparative-historical scholarship shows that greater attention to critical antecedents can enhance causal inference and knowledge accumulation by: (1) resolving debates over historical timing; (2) highlighting common findings in otherwise competing explanations; (3) enhancing the social-structural grounding of choice-theoretic arguments; and (4) facilitating the comparison of cases with significant historical dissimilarities. The regress involved in such a deepened historical approach to causation proves to be informative, not infinite.
1	Inequality, family and school characteristics were linked to student achievement as shown by multi-level analyses of 107,975 15 year olds' mathematics tests and questionnaires in 41 countries. Equal distribution of country and school resources were linked to higher mathematics scores. Students scored higher in families or schools with more resources (SES, native born, two parents, more educational materials, higher SES schoolmates, female schoolmates, class time, educated teachers) or beneficial intangible processes (communication, discipline, teacher-student relationships). Students living with grandparents or siblings (especially older ones) scored lower. Physical family resource variables showed similar results across countries, supporting the social reproduction hypothesis for physical resources. In richer countries, intangible processes had stronger links with mathematics achievement, suggesting that greater availability of public physical resources raises the value of complementary intangible processes, which can help explain the Heyneman-Loxley effect of stronger family effects in richer countries.
0	Mexican migrant workers, especially the undocumented, compose a large, growing and integral part of the Idaho labor force. However, their harsh working conditions and generally lower levels of socioeconomic status, as well as the positive influence of recent undocumented Mexican migration on the Idaho economy, are still poorly recognized and understood. The two principal purposes of this article are to (1) provide a socio-demographic profile of undocumented Mexican workers to understand their size, quality, working conditions, employment and wage penalties, utilization of social services, and economic contributions in Idaho; and (2) identify the possible labor supply and demand factors affecting the social mobility and earnings outcomes of undocumented Mexican migrant workers.  The primary data sources in this research include: the 1990 & 2000 Public Use Microdata Survey (PUMS), 1994-2004 Current Population Survey (CPS) March Social and Economic Supplement and 1970-2004 American Community Survey (ACS), collected by the Census Bureau, the 1990-2002 INS statistics collected by the Office of Immigration and Naturalization Services, and the 1994-2002 Mexican Migration Project data (MMP) collected by Douglas Massey since 1982.
1	Using data from the Fragile Families Study, we examine how unmarried parents' risk of divorce influences their decision to marry. Regression results show that unmarried parents with a high predicted probability of marital dissolution (based on estimates of marital dissolution for a sample of initially married mothers with similar characteristics) had significantly lower odds of marriage to the father of their child even after controlling for individual and relationship characteristics expected to influence marriage transitions. The dissolution propensity we examine also includes a measure of the local divorce climate. As such, our results provide support for the argument that high rates of divorce in the population have led to a fear of divorce among unmarried parents which reduces their probability of marriage.

0	The political socialization of children of immigrants is often considered a job of the school. However, research has not examined whether school-based civic and political learning is more important to political outcomes for immigrant students as compared to their third-plus generation peers. This research investigates to what extent school-based factors contribute to the likelihood of voting in early adulthood and whether this effect is actually stronger for children of immigrants. We focus on performance in social studies and exposure to certain types of civics courses, and how the social makeup of the school may moderate this effect. We find that although there is not a significant difference in the school-based effects for second-generation students as compared to third-generation students, the social makeup of the school, specifically the concentration of immigrants, moderates the effect of the formal social studies curriculum for second-generation immigrant students.
1	"Data from 44 societies are used to explore sex segregation by field of study. Contrary to accounts linking socioeconomic modernization to a ""degendering"" of public-sphere institutions, sex typing of curricular fields is stronger in more economically developed contexts. The authors argue that two cultural forces combine in advanced industrial societies to create a new sort of sex segregation regime. The first is gender-essentialist ideology, which has proven to be extremely resilient even in the most liberal-egalitarian of contexts; the second is self-expressive value systems, which create opportunities and incentives for the expression of ""gendered selves."" Multivariate analyses suggest that structural features of postindustrial labor markets and modern educational systems support the cultivation, realization, and display of gender-specific curricular affinities."
1	Most theoretical perspectives on neighborhood effects on youth assume that neighborhood context serves as a source of socialization. The exact source v and Processes underlying adolescent socialization in disadvantaged neighborhoods, however: are largely unspecified and unelaborated. This article proposes that cross-cohort socialization by older neighborhood peers is one source of socialization for adolescent boys. Data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey suggest that adolescents in disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to spend time with older individuals. I analyze qualitative interview data from 60 adolescent boys in three neighborhoods in Boston to understand the causes and consequences of these interactions and relationships. Some of the strategies these adolescents employ to cope with violence in disadvantaged neighborhoods promote interaction with older peers, particularly, those who are most disadvantaged. Furthermore, such interactions can expose adolescents to local, unconventional, or alternative cultural models.
0	"Studies about coalitions or divisions within social movements often emphasize movement organizations' resources or ideologies.  But disagreements over policy often reflect differences across a wide array of organizational characteristics, which can be considered as ""core political competencies.""  These include the organizations ideologies and material resources but also factors such as preferred tactics or experience in designing outreach campaigns.  In New Jersey, environmental lobby organizations split with local environmental groups by arguing that the state's collaborative watershed management program distracted from its duty to enforce environmental regulations.  In this case, differences in the opposing factions' competencies based on geographic focus and experience in state-level politics determined the split, rather than differences in ideology or resources."
1	Previous research on China's labor market gender gaps has emphasized the human and political capital disadvantages of women and new discrimination in the reform era. Analyzing the China Urban Labor Survey/China Adult Literacy Survey, this paper shows that while women are significantly disadvantaged by various measures of human and political capital, these disadvantages explain little of the observed gender gaps in employment status and earnings. Instead, gender gaps in employment and earnings are strongly related to family status. It is only married women and mothers who face significant disadvantages. This finding is likely tied to the fact that wives and mothers spend much more time than husbands and fathers doing household chores, even net Of controls for potential earnings. These results suggest that research on gender disparities in urban China would be complemented by additional attention to family-work conflict, a topic which looms large in research on gender and labor in most other countries.
1	This study uses population data of the Netherlands (municipality registers) between 1995 and 2008 to describe and explain the occurrence of divorce among recently newlywed interethnic and mono-ethnic couples (N = 116,745). In line with homogamy theory, divorce risks are higher for interethnic couples, in particular if the spouses were born and raised in countries that are culturally distant from each other. In addition, the effect of cultural distance is smaller for second generation immigrants than for first generation immigrants. There is no evidence for a higher risk of divorce among Black-White marriages. In line with convergence theory, results show that the higher the divorce propensity in the wife's origin country, the higher the divorce risk of a couple is. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

1	Scholars and policy makers have for centuries constructed and used developmental hierarchies to characterize different countries. The hypotheses motivating this paper are that such social constructions have been circulated internationally, are constructed similarly in various countries, and follow the social constructions of elite international organizations, such as the United Nations. This paper uses data from 15 surveys in 13 diverse countries to study how developmental hierarchies are understood in everyday life. Our research shows that most people have constructions of developmental hierarchies that are similar across countries and are similar to the developmental hierarchies constructed by the United Nations. These findings suggest that developmental hierarchies are widely understood around the world and are widely available to ordinary people as they make decisions about many aspects of life.

1	Under conditions of uncertainty, we predict that development will be tied to the idiosyncrasy of organizational forms represented within local regions. Our investigation applies this theory to data on 342 counties and 43,352 businesses in the US. South during Reconstruction, finding support for the thesis that organizational idiosyncrasy generally dampens growth and challenges taken-for-granted norms of community structure. The causal effect varies somewhat depending on whether the underlying mechanisms entail increases in the production of local goods, the accumulation of fixed capital, or the attraction Of new residents and retention of existing ones. We conclude by considering if the theory may generalize to other settings, including locales that depart markedly from the close-knit agrarian culture of the postbellum South.
1	The degree to which social well-being is predicated upon levels of material consumption remains under-examined from a large-N, quantitative perspective. The present study analyzes the factors influencing levels of maternal mortality in 2005 among 92 peripheral countries. We incorporate into regression analysis the ecological footprint, a comprehensive measure of natural resource consumption, and alternative explanatory variables drawn from previous research. Results illustrate ecological footprint consumption has a moderately strong direct influence shaping lower levels of maternal mortality. Path analysis reveals export commodity concentration has a negative effect on level of ecological footprint demand net the strong positive influence of income per capita. This illustrates cross-national trade dependency relations directly influence natural resource consumption opportunities and thereby indirectly contribute to higher maternal mortality levels within the periphery of the world economy. The results confirm material consumption is an important dimension of improvement in maternal mortality. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	Females have long been considered to be the inferior sex.  From the time of Galen and Aristotle, womens sexual organs were considered to be stunted versions of male sexual organs.  Today, we still see remnants of this sexism in scientific and media representations of fetal sex development. In this research, the author examines media images of fetal sex development published in three major newsweeklies, three major popular science magazines, two major newspapers, and the initiating scientific research.  In both the scientific research and the media, fetal sex development is assumed to be equivalent to male fetal sex development. Female fetal sex development is considered the default and is largely ignored. In addition, the media are supportive of the research and its conclusions  even when previous research was later discredited. Study details are interspersed with positive evaluative statements, giving the impression that the research is valid and worthy of trust.
0	In this paper I argue that conceptualizations of oppression often conflate exploitation and alienation.  However, the terms are not synonymous and exploitation and alienation are not necessarily connected (i.e., work conditions can be exploitative, but not alienating and vice versa).  To support my argument I use examples from a three-year ethnographic study of bicycle messengering—a low-wage, physically exhausting job, rife with danger.  I propose that despite the risks and strain involved in being a bike messenger, the labor is not alienating.  In making my argument I compare and contrast the workday games of bike messengers with the machinists in Michael Burawoy’s classic ethnography of factory labor.
0	"Transnational studies and collective memory studies have been in vogue in sociology in recent years, yet surprisingly few sociologists have integrated the two areas, or brought them into conversation with studies of community formation among refugees from political violence and genocide.  This roundtable presentation, part of a more extensive research project in progress, explores the impact of memory on the formation of identities among refugees in the aftermath of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Hercegovina in the early 1990s.  Drawing on semi-structured interviews and fieldwork with more than 60 refugees and community leaders in the US, and 8 displaced persons from B-H now living in Serbia and Croatia, I discuss the ways that ethno-national identity is (re)constructed through selective acts of remembering, forgetting, and transmitting experiences of inter-group relations from childhood and extended family life, the recent war, and return visits to B-H. Drawing on these memories, differentiated as well by prior social class, regional background, age, gender, and resettlement experience, I examine the following identity formations:  (re)assumption of ""Yugoslav"" identity, turn toward ""Islamist"" identity, new nationalist identity, allergy to all national identities. This work is significant not only because it brings diverse areas of social theory and research together to bear on a little-researched new immigrant group, but also because it matters to sociologists and citizens--their ""neighbors""-- who struggle to understand and represent the meanings and consequences of extreme political violence for an increasing number of forcibly displaced persons in this post Cold War age of new globalization and transnationalism."
1	Sociologists have long used educational expectations to understand the complex mental processes underlying individuals' educational decision making. Yet, little research evaluates how students actually formulate their educational expectations. Status attainment theory asserts that students adopt their educational expectations early based on family background and social influences, and that their educational expectations are driven by a static mental construct as a result. In contrast, recent research based on Bayesian learning theory hypothesizes that students mostly adapt their educational expectations in light of new information about their academic potential. Comparing models of expectations formation in adolescence, we find that students' expectations do not derive from a static mental construct. However, students adapt their educational expectations only modestly and only in response to very large changes in grade point averages. Thus, adolescent educational expectations stabilize early and are rather persistent over time.
0	In this paper, I use theoretical and empirical evidence to argue that there is no gendered body that is independent of social class, just as there is no social class body that is independent of gender.  Using an intersectional approach, I examine the ways in which the gender and social class habitus (and cultural capital) are formed; the lessons about gender and social class that emerge from tales of social mobility and the role of the body therein; and the ways in which the gendered and classed body is marked through consumption and status displays.  In weaving these themes together, I argue that gender trumps social class in bodily expressions for men, such that the masculine body is more rigidly constructed and constrained than the feminine body; conversely, the female body is more plastic when it comes to social class constructions and expressions.  While the rigidity of gender expression for men is, in some ways, limiting, I also show that the universal and invisible nature of social class embodiment for men constitutes a form of privilege.
1	Few studies have considered how earnings inequality estimates may be affected by measurement error in self-reported earnings in surveys. Utilizing restricted-use data that links workers in the Survey of Income and Program Participation with their W-2 earnings records, we examine the effect of measurement error on estimates of racial earnings inequality. Results show that varying levels of mean-reverting error causes underestimation of earnings inequality. Notably, mean reversion is steeper for Black men than for White men, bringing about substantial downward bias in the estimated earnings gaps between Whites and Blacks at lower percentiles as well as large underestimation of within-racial group inequality for Black men. Together, our results call attention to the potential distortions generated by systematic measurement error on economic inequality estimates.
1	Persons who are relatively younger have a comparably higher incidence of crime victimization than those who are older. Comparative studies of crime rates among those 65 and older with those for younger persons across time are virtually nonexistent. This study provides these analyses. Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey are used to study the relative victimization rate among US elders. Macroeconomic indicators and environmental interventions were included to examine whether structural forces influence elder crime victimization rates. Such influences are fractionally cointegrated with the long-term elder property and personal crime rates, with each having a distinct data-generating process. The results of these analyses suggest that personal, but not property, crime rates have declined since the passage of the Crime Bill of 1994. As well, the summer months are associated with elevated rates of property crime committed against elders but not personal crime. 
1	The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) housing experiment has proven to be an important intervention not just in the lives of the poor, but in social science theories of neighborhood effects. Competing causal claims have been the subject of considerable disagreement, culminating in the debate between Clampet-Lundquist and Massey and Ludwig et al. in this issue. This article assesses the debate by clarifying analytically distinct questions posed by neighborhood-level theories, reconceptualizing selection bias as a fundamental social process worthy of study in its own right rather than a statistical nuisance, and reconsidering the scientific method of experimentation, and hence causality, in the social world of the city. The author also analyzes MTO and independent survey data from Chicago to examine trajectories of residential attainment. Although MTO provides crucial leverage for estimating neighborhood effects on individuals, as proponents rightly claim, this study demonstrates the implications imposed by a stratified urban structure and how MTO simultaneously provides a new window on the social reproduction of concentrated inequality.
0	Health care seeking behavior of immigrants in a new environment can be understood as a specific aspect of the general process of adaptation. This paper examines how health care seeking behaviors of immigrants are shaped during the early immigration stage through the comparative analysis of three immigrant groups in Hawaii: Filipinos, Koreans, and Marshallese. Individual face-to-face interviews with (1) legal immigrants in Hawaii who have been in the U.S. no longer than 5 years (2) key informants in three ethnic communities, and (3) health and social service providers  were conducted in Hawaii. Small focus groups with key informants and service providers supplemented the individual interviews. This study reveals that seeking behaviors of both primary and preventive health care among Koreans are dramatically diminished after immigration while it is increased for Filipinos and Marshallese. Differences in availability and accessibility of professional health care services stemming from the health insurance system and the health care infrastructure, coupled with state immigrant health policies make critical contributions to the transition of health care seeking behaviors of each group. The culturally distinctive, normative patterns of illness definition and responses as well as socioeconomic characteristics influence the retention of certain health care seeking practices.
0	For 2000 years the conduct and analysis of international relations saw the state as the central actor.  For the past century, realism has been the leading theory or ideology espoused by political scientists and practitioners in the field.  While a number of alternative theories have challenged classic realism, it is only the last two decades that has seen a more sociological approach, constructivism, emerge to seriously challenge realism.  The present paper follows the constructivist approach to argue that the current neoliberal flavor of globalization is rendering the state as an institution, and realism as an ideology, less central, and in some might argue nearing impotence, in the practice of international relations.  While at the present conjuncture this vacuum in global political power may on the surface seem to feature cultural clashes as a salient element, at a social structural level, the inherent contradictions of capitalism, this paper argues, fuels the global conflict we see today.
1	Social contexts in which confidants get to know each other affect the composition of their personal networks, inter alia the similarity among confidants. Results from analyses on a representative sample of the Dutch population between 18 and 65 years of age (SSND 2000), support the idea that differences in similarity among confidants can be explained by 1.) the social composition of a context, 2.) the extent to which interactions within a context are enforced, and 3.) the amount of time people spend in a context. Moreover, there is a certain degree of path-dependency in the use of social contexts, that leads to reinforced context effects on similarity among confidants.
1	Steven Nock argued that love understood narrowly in terms of emotional and sexual intimacy-was a flimsy foundation for relationships and that the institution of marriage provided a firmer footing for stable, high-quality relationships than love alone. Relying on data from the Marriage Matters Survey of 1414 married men and women in Louisiana (1998-2004), we extended Nock's insights to consider whether contemporary marriages organized along institutional lines enjoyed more stability, satisfaction, and less conflict than marriages organized around a soulmate model. Largely consistent with Nock's perspective, we found that individuals who embraced norms of marital permanency and gender specialization and were embedded in social networks and religious institutions enjoyed high-quality stable marriages, so long as they also focused on the expressive dimension of married life. By contrast, spouses who embraced a soulmate model of marriage experienced high levels of satisfaction but also experienced high levels of conflict and divorce. Finally, spouses who embraced traditional norms about marriage without the benefit of social support for those norms reported low levels of marital quality.

1	Studies have shown that intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with poor mental health. But, does women's, and specifically mother's, mental health improve after leaving a union marked by IPV? We used two waves of the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (n = 2610) to examine the association between IPV as measured by controlling and violent behaviors, and maternal mental health and union dissolution. Mothers in unions marked by IPV reported poorer mental health, became more depressed and maintained high levels of anxiety over time regardless of whether or not their union dissolved, compared to mothers who were in non-abusive unions. Mothers in stable non-abusive unions became more depressed over time, but at a lower magnitude than mothers in controlling and violent unions. Mothers in non-abusive unions that dissolved also became more depressed and anxious over time. Overall, we find that women are still at risk for mental health problems even after leaving IPV unions. 
0	Of the many forms of racial segregation that uniquely define the lives of African Americans, public housing projects are perhaps the most notorious.  Largely a by-product of racially discriminative practices seeking to control the “Great Migration” of southern blacks into northern cities, public housing was by the late 80’s widely considered a “failed” public policy.   From the early 90’s to 2007, the US Department of Housing and Development’s “HOPE VI” policy initiative had caused the demolition of some 78,000+ housing units, projecting at least 10,400 more.  The following paper employs Adams and Padamsee’s (2001) model of “policy regimes” to understand the processes by which such a massive transformation of urban spaces and the lives that inhabit them could proceed with such little public opposition.  I argue that we cannot understand the “decline” of public housing or the corresponding rise of mixed-income development without considering the changing ways that race and class inequalities are discussed and addressed in the public sphere and how the latter shapes the capacities and actions of state managers as well as the development and implementation of policy.

1	This study employs a social capital perspective to examine determinants and content of informal communication about HIV/AIDS among members of different Christian congregations in Mozambique. First, we use data from a survey conducted in both rural and urban congregations to analyze factors that shape such communication, and detect that it is more likely to occur in gender-homophilous networks, in more ideologically flexible and socially diverse congregations, and in congregations located in rural areas. We then use the survey data to examine the main themes of congregation-based communication about HIV/AIDS and find denominational and location patterns that correspond to those detected in the first stage of analysis. Finally, we use qualitative data, collected in parallel with the survey, to explore how informal communication is used to reconcile the often conflicting secular and church messages. We interpret our findings in light of structural dynamics within religious congregations and the social construction of HIV/AIDS risks and prevention in that sub-Saharan setting.
1	Dominant theoretical explanations of racial disparities in criminal offending overlook a key risk factor associated with race: interpersonal racial discrimination. Building on recent studies that analyze race and crime at the micro-level, we specify a social psychological model linking personal experiences with racial discrimination to an increased risk of offending. We add to this model a consideration of an adaptive facet of African American culture: ethnic-racial socialization, and explore whether two forms-cultural socialization and preparation for bias-provide resilience to the criminogenic effects of interpersonal racial discrimination. Using panel data from several hundred African American male youth from the Family and Community Health Study, we find that racial discrimination is positively associated with increased crime in large part by augmenting depression, hostile views of relationships, and disengagement from conventional norms. Results also indicate that preparation for bias significantly reduces the effects of discrimination on crime, primarily by reducing the effects of these social psychological mediators on offending. Cultural socialization has a less influential but beneficial effect. Finally, we show that the more general parenting context within which preparation for bias takes place influences its protective effects.
1	Humans transformed landscapes at an unprecedented scale and pace during the 20th century, creating sprawling urban areas in affluent countries and large-scale agricultural expanses in tropics. To date, attempts to explain these processes in other disciplines have had a disembodied, ahistorical quality to them. A sociological account of these changes emphasizes the role of strategic actions by states and coalitions of interested parties in transforming landscapes. It identifies the agents of change and the timing of transformative events. Case studies of suburban sprawl and tropical deforestation illustrate the value of the sociological approach and the wide range of situations to which it applies.
1	Taking a cross-national perspective, we investigate linkages between volunteer work, informal help, and care among Europeans aged 50 or older. Based on 27,297 personal interviews from the 2004 Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we estimate univariate and multivariate probit models, which allow us to analyze the interrelationship between those non-market productive activities. There is substantial variation in the participation in volunteering, helping, and caring between countries. Independent of the general level of activity in a country, we find evidence for a complementary and interdependent relationship between all three activities. Our findings not only suggest an important role of societal opportunity structures in elders' productive engagement, but also support notions of the existence of a general motivation to be active.

0	Muslims in the United States include many immigrants and their children; one expert (Smith 2004) claims that over half of Muslims living in the United States are members of the first, second, or third generation.  Given this, it increasingly apparent that any research on Muslims in the United States needs to consider how both Muslim immigrants and their American-born, or second-generation, offspring adapt to life in the United States.  This study will examine gender differences in ethno-religious identity of second-generation Muslim Americans, and place its findings within the larger literature on gender, acculturation, and religiosity. This study addresses the questions: a) are second-generation Muslim women, as a group, more religious than their male counter-parts, and b) is there a gender difference in the effect of religion on acculturation?  Gender differences in the ethno-religious adaptation of second-generation Muslim Americans is a critical area of study given that some of the more obvious differences between Muslim and non-Muslim youth are centered on the often gendered issues of sexual comportment and dress style.  Data will be obtained using semi-structured qualitative interviews with 64 second-generation Muslim Americans of varying levels of religious identification and participation.  Half of the sample will be male, and the other half female.
1	Past research on international migration from Mexico to the United States uses geographically-limited data and analyzes emigrant-sending communities in isolation. Theories supported by this research may not explain urban emigration, and this research does not consider connections between rural and urban Mexico. In this study we use national data from Mexico to investigate rural and urban emigration. We find that a central motivation for emigration - self-insurance through labor market diversification - is most relevant to less rural, non-metropolitan places. Paradoxically, while Mexican cities have the lowest rates of emigration, the rural places that are spatially proximate to cities have the highest rates. These findings suggest that while urban development retains emigrants within city borders, it may generate emigration out of neighboring rural places.
0	In this paper I argue that in order to theorize violence, it is necessary to consider not only the contingent/historical character of particular expressions of violence, but also the more permanent/meta-historical character of social identities.  This is, it is necessary not only to look at identities already constituted, but at the very process of constitution of social identities itself.    Only then, it is possible to see the schism that is inherent to every social identity.  This schism between the particular (the empirico) and the universal (as the transcendental moral horizon which allows the articulation of social life), is what accounts for both, freedom, social change, and also for social antagonism. Social antagonism, expressed as social exclusion and violence, is a reaction to the fear of social disintegration; this is, the fear of the possibility of losing the universal/moral horizon that makes society possible.  On the other side, I argue that violence expresses a paradoxical dynamic between morality and enjoyment.  Violence at the same time that attempts to restore the threatened symbolic order (that makes society possible), constitutes the ultimate transgression of that symbolic order.
1	This article uses a feminist framework to explore embodied aging by analyzing in-depth formal interviews with 57 men and women in their 60s, 70s and 80s. Emphasizing intersectionality, I focus on the interpretations and strategies these men and women use to make sense of their aging bodies. Their aging corporeal experiences allow me to examine ageist notions about aging and being old and to explore how this thinking, which valorizes youthfulness, shapes their aging experiences.
0	Adolescent problem behaviour has shown rising trends over the last 50 years. Among the possible contributors to these trends,  so called declines in the quality of family life and parenting have loomed large in both public and policy debate. Family composition and levels of family disruption have shown major changes over that period, as have parents working lives. Given these demographic trends, it seems plausible to assume that more proximal indicators of parenting  well-established predictors of young people's problem behaviour  may also have changed at the same time. To date, however, very little is known about the evidence for these assumptions; few studies have attempted to address time trends in parenting and the extent to which they could account for rising levels of problem behaviour in the young.  In this paper we undertake new analyses of two major UK data sets that have repeated measures of relevant constructs of parenting.   These data yield no evidence for a decline in parenting; instead, current evidence points to apparent improvements in a number of indicators of parents involvement with and supervision of their teenage children.  Our analysis does however highlight the importance of parental mental health, and to a lesser extent family type and social disadvantage, as of potential importance in understanding trends in youth problem behaviour.  We draw implications of these findings for future research on trends in parenting and the  rise in adolescent behaviour problems.
1	AIDS media lead unexpected lives once distributed through urban space: billboards fade, posters go missing, bumper stickers travel to other cities. The materiality of AIDS campaign objects and of the urban settings in which they are displayed structures how the public interprets their messages. Ethnographic observation of AIDS media in situ and interview data reveal how the materiality of objects and places shapes the availability of AIDS knowledge in Accra, Ghana. Significantly for AIDS organizations, these material conditions often systematically obstruct access to AIDS knowledge for particular groups. Attending to materiality rethinks how scholars assess the cultural power of media.
1	Does social capital-trust and association involvement-predict political consumerism-boycotting and boycotting? Using data from the 2002/2003 European Social Survey we conduct a multilevel logit analysis of 24,854 individuals nested in 228 within-country regions to evaluate whether social capital and political consumerism are positively related at both the individual and regional level. Findings indicate that individuals with greater personal social capital and those who live in regions with higher average levels of social capital are more likely to be political consumers. These results support previous findings that link social capital with other forms of civic engagement.
1	This study applies latent trajectory methods to the analysis of temporal changes in homicide rates among large US cities across recent decades Specifically annual homicide rates for 157 large US cities are analyzed for the 30 years from 1976 to 2005 We address the fundamental questions Did all of cities experience similar levels and patterns of rise and decline in homicide rates over these three decades? Or is there hidden or unobserved heterogeneity with respect to these temporal patterns thus leading to the identification of more homogeneous groupings of the cities? And if latent homogeneous groupings surface, is membership due to specific structural characteristics found within those cities? Evidence is found for the existence of four latent homicide rate trajectories After identifying and classifying the cities Into these four groups multivariate statistical techniques are used to determine which social and economic characteristics are significant predictors of these distinct homicide trends Criminal justice measures are also included as controls It is found that larger cities located in the South with higher levels of resource depravation/concentrated poverty higher income inequality higher percentages of the adult male population that are divorced, higher unemployment rates higher percentages of youth higher percentages of the population who are Hispanic and higher numbers of police per capita are more likely to be in a higher than a lower homicide trajectory group Higher percentages of the population enrolled in colleges and universities and locations in states with higher incarceration rates are characteristics of cities associated with membership in a lower homicide trajectory group 
1	"Despite a number of contemporary theoretical works in sociology and moral philosophy arguing that the project of modern selfhood is necessarily a deeply moral endeavor, there are few empirical studies examining the specific ways in which social actors construct moral selves and lives. Utilizing ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, this article examines how a group of adult Muslim converts in Missouri produced new moral selves in and through the use of embodied religious practices. Drawing on the theoretical insights of Bourdieu, I demonstrate how the embodied religious practices of ritual prayer, fasting and covering formed within converts the moral dispositions, or habitus, associated with becoming a 'good Muslim.""."

Results indicate highly comparable levels of reporting reliability of the composite variables in the HRS relative to those found for “summary” income approaches used in other surveys. Levels of reliability vary by type of income source—reports of monthly benefit levels from sources such as Social Security or VA benefits achieve near perfect levels of reliability, whereas somewhat less regular sources of household income that vary across time in their amounts are measured less reliably. One major area of concern resulting from this research, which may be beneficial to users of the HRS surveys involves the use of imputation in the handling of missing data. We found that imputation of values for top-end open income brackets can produce a substantial number of outliers that affect sample estimates of relationships and levels of reliability. Imputed income values in the HRS should be used with great care.
1	Although sociologists have identified education as likely determinant of migration, the ways in which education affects migration are unclear and empirical results are disparate. This paper addresses the relationship between educational attainment, enrolment, and migration, focusing on the role of gender and how it changes with evolving social contexts. Using empirical analyses based in Nepal, results indicate that educational attainment has positive effects and enrolment has negative effects on out-migration and including enrolment in the model increases the effect of attainment. In the case of women, with the changing role of gender, increased education and labor force participation, the affect of educational attainment changes drastically over time, from almost no effect, to a strong positive effect. Consideration of enrolment, and the role of gender in education, employment, and marriage may help to explain the disparate results in past research on education and migration. 
0	This study examines a particular aspect of violence against women that has not yet received a great deal of attention:  the fear of potential violence (i.e., threat) that many women experience on a daily basis.  Drawing from qualitative interviews with a sample of 14 African American and 14 Caucasian women, I examine the presence, sources, and consequences of fear to women; that is, the forces that cause fear, the extent to which fear exists in the everyday lives of women, and its costs.  Findings conceptualize women's sense of threat as a routine aspect of their lives.  The normalization of the presence and gendered nature of threat and fear provokes among women a ubiquitous, vigilant awareness that leads to the avoidance of socially constructed cues of danger.  This avoidance, in turn, can influence the structure of daily life for women and constrict their freedom.  The consequences of these social processes are great; for women themselves, there is a notable imposition on freedom of movement, a reinforcement of self perceptions of vulnerability, the noxious experience of fear and anxiety, the narrowing effects of forced choices and limited options, and long term cumulative strategic adjustments that can alter the course of a life.  Social costs include the perpetuation of gender and racial stereotypes, as well as untold costs in human creativity and productivity.  Disentangling the roots of fear, then, illuminates its social nature and its ties to the maintenance of social inequality.
0	This paper documents the multiple dimensions of the small world of the corporate elite between 1962 and 1995.  After identifying the corporations that define the members of the corporate elite in four time periods (1962, 1973, 1983 and 1995), the initial analysis examines the interpersonal affiliations constituting the small world of these corporate directors.  The next three sections of the paper define and document additional sources of social cohesion formed by the corporate elites participation in 12 policy planning organizations, 25 non-profit foundations, roughly 50 major cultural institutions across the country.  In each section, the analyses address the extent to which levels of corporate interlocking among the directors are associated with levels of inter-organizational ties.  The final section integrates all sources of social ties to describe how participation in policy planning, non-profit foundations and cultural institutions further contracts the small world of the corporate elite.  The results show that these non-corporate affiliations increase the average number of unique ties and decrease the average geodesic distances among the directors in all four time periods.  However, the contributions of each of these supplemental social affiliations change over time with a decline in the roles of cultural ties and an increase in the importance of participation in policy planning organizations.
1	Using a unique dataset on the geographic distribution of reported protest events from local sources, the study explains the variation in community-level mobilization in response to neoliberal reforms in two countries in the global periphery. Building on insights from macro, cross-national studies of protests related to market reforms, this article highlights local structural conditions that more likely generate popular contention in poorer countries. Count regression models show that localities with greater levels of state and community infrastructure (highways, administrative offices, universities, NGOs and local chapters of oppositional parties) were associated with heightened collective action opposing the privatization of health care and public utilities. These state and community infrastructures were shaped by national contexts in the era of state-led development preceding the current epoch of accelerated globalization.
1	"Complex social systems require knowledge specialists who provide information that political actors rely on to solve policy challenges. Successful advice is unproblematic; more significant is assigning institutional blame in the aftermath of advice considered wrong or harmful, undercutting state security. How do experts, operating within epistemic communities, preserve their reputation in the face of charges of incompetence or malice? Attacks on experts and their sponsors can be an effective form of contentious politics, a wedge to denounce other institutional players. To examine the politics of expertise we analyze the debate in the early 1950s over ""Who Lost China?,"" the congressional attempt to assign responsibility for the fall of the Nationalist regime to the Communists. Using a ""strong case,"" we examine political battles over the motives of Professor Owen Lattimore. For epistemic authority an expert must be defined as qualified (having appropriate credentials), influential (providing consequential information), and innocent (demonstrating epistemic neutrality). We focus on two forms of attack: smears (an oppositional presentation of a set of linked claims) and degradation ceremonies (the institutional awarding of stigma). We differentiate these by the critic's links to systems of power. Smears appear when reputational rivals lack power to make their claims stick, while degradation ceremonies operate through dominance within an institutional setting. Policy experts are awarded provisional credibility, but this access to an autonomous realm of knowledge can be countered by opponents with alternate sources of power. Ultimately expertise involves not only knowledge, but also the presentation of a validated self."
1	Social movement scholars have long been skeptical of culture impact on political change, perhaps for good reason, since little empirical research explicitly addresses this question. This article fills the void by examining the dynamics and the impact of the month-long 2004 same-sex wedding protest in San Francisco. We integrate insights of contentious politics approaches with social constructionist conceptions and identify three core features of cultural repertoires: contestation, intentionality, and collective identity. Our analyses, which draw on rich qualitative and quantitative data from interviews with participants and movement leaders and a random survey of participants, highlight these dimensions of cultural repertoires as well as the impact that the same-sex wedding protest had on subsequent activism. Same-sex weddings, as our multimethod analyses show, were an intentional episode of claim-making, with participants arriving with a history of activism in a variety of other social movements. Moreover relative to the question of impact, the initial protest sparked other forms of political action that ignited a statewide campaign for marriage equality in California. Our results offer powerful evidence that culture can be consequential not only internally, with implications for participant solidarity and identity, but for political change and further action as well. We conclude by discussing the specifics of our case and the broader implications for social movement scholars.
1	In this article, the authors examine ethnic identity development among Korean adoptees and the ways they explore their ethnicity in early adulthood. They argue that social context plays an important role in mediating whether and how adoptees pursue ethnic exploration. Employing a grounded theory analysis of a uniquely representative sample of Korean adoptees, they find that historical period and institutional setting shape the availability, content, and experience of exploration. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for research on racial stratification, ethnic assimilation, ethnic identity, and transracial adoptees.
1	Academic observers of contemporary American politics tend to portray the political sector as characterized by little variation in the options for citizen-based action, represented by professional advocacy organizations that provide few avenues for meaningful civic involvement. This article challenges this dominant imagery and examines how much variety exists in the organizational models available for citizen voice at the national level in the United States and how the observed models are linked to the goals, strategies, and claims advanced by a diverse set of national advocacy groups. Analysis of a sample of Washington, DC-based political organizations identified five distinct models of organizing that differ significantly in terms of their structural characteristics and their association with the goals and activities that animate collective action at the national level in the United States. Keywords: advocacy, interest groups, social movements, civic engagement, organizational diversity.
0	In this article, I draw upon ethnographic research conducted within the US anime fan community in order to understand the reproduction of hierarchal gender relations within a small group context. Even though the anime fan community is largely comprised of women and girls, its grounding in the masculinized sci-fi and fantasy fandoms ensures the continued valuation of hegemonic masculinitity. While male fans embody the subordinated masculinity of “nerd” in the regional context of US culture, in the local context of the fan community they recreate a hegemonic masculinity based on mental capacity. In this context, hegemonic femininities arise in which women are valued for cute, innocent, deferential, self-presentations, as embodied by maids and Lolitas. In contrast, the sexual agency displayed by fans of homoerotic anime and manga (yaoi fangirls) embodies a pariah femininity which poses a threat to hegemonic masculinity in the fan community.
1	This article examines why and how environmental activists, despite considerable political weakness and disproportionallly few resources, won substantive negotiating concessions that far outstripped labor achievements during NAFTA's negotiation. Despite a trade policy arena hostile to their demands, environmentalists gained official recognition for the legitimacy of their claims, obtained a seat at the negotiating table, turned a previously technocratic concern into a highly visible populist issue, and won an environmental side agreement stronger than its labor counterpart. We argue that this unexpected outcome is best explained by environmentalists' strategic use of mechanisms available at the intersection of multiple fields. While field theory mainly focuses on interactions within a particular field, we suggest that the structure of overlap between fields-the architecture of field overlap-creates unique points of leverage that render particular targets more vulnerable and certain strategies more effective for activists. We outline the mechanisms associated with the structure of field overlap-alliance brokerage, rulemaking, resource brokerage, and frame adaptation-that enable activists to strategically leverage advantages across fields to transform the political landscape.
1	Parent and peer influences on academic achievement are well documented, but little research has examined links to romantic involvement during the adolescent period. This study draws on interviews with 572 currently dating teens and results indicate that the romantic partner's grades are significantly related to adolescent respondents' self-reported grades, even after their own orientation toward school and traditional family, peer, and demographic controls have been taken into account. We hypothesize, following results on peer influence processes, that this concordance reveals a tendency to select similar partners, but may involve social influence processes as well. A longitudinal analysis in which partners' grades predict respondents' grades reported at the second interview (controlling for wave one grades and the other covariates) lends support to this view. We also explore the role of age, gender and race/ethnicity as affecting the nature of these relationships. Finally, we draw on the content of in-depth interviews elicited from a subset of the respondents to illustrate both types of mechanisms (selection vs. influence). These results underscore the importance of continuing to explore the role of romantic partners in connection with a broad range of prosocial as well as problem adolescent outcomes.(c) 2008 published by Elsevier Inc.
0	We investigate the influence of work on health using a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 60 and above. Using five waves of data collected between 1990 and 2002, we estimate regression models for multiple dimensions of health as a function of health at the previous wave and labor force transitions between waves. Measures of health include self-rated health, physical functioning, morbidity, depressive symptomatology, and cognitive functioning. To limit problems of reverse causality, we focus on changes in health status among respondents who did not experience any change in labor force status between waves. Our central finding is that those who remain in the labor force have significantly better health, net of baseline health status. For example, an index of six ADLs is .1-.2 lower for those continuously in the labor force compared to otherwise similar respondents continuously out of the labor force. Although small in absolute terms, this difference is more than half the size of the mean cross-wave increase in functional limitations. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that work may be beneficial for health at older ages and that this relationship does not differ significantly by gender.
0	We examine and critique claims that student achievement can be improved with increased educational markets, increased testing of student progress, and the use of tests to evaluate teacher and school quality.  We use data from the 2009 PISA survey of over 400,000 students in 64 countries to evaluate the effects of educational markets and accountability systems on student achievement.  We use multilevel modeling plus propensity score matching to estimate the role of school choice, subsidized private schools, principal autonomy, testing, and the use of tests for accountability on academic achievement. We test whether the inclusion of school SES and measured selection variables might lead to different findings about the international effects of school choice and accountability.  We find that the positive effect of school choice is spurious once school SES is controlled. We also find that both using testing for teacher and school accountability and the increased use of standardized tests is correlated with lower levels of student achievement in cross-sectional models.  In our propensity score models, we find no support for the theoretical predictions that school choice, accountability policies, and increased standardized testing leads to increased student achievement.
0	In the United States, family policies aimed at the needy have been seriously undermined, particularly with the introduction of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA).  Under this act, federally guaranteed cash assistance to those most in need and at risk, particularly low-income mothers with children, was effectively ended.  Many single-parent families, which are predominately headed by women, live in poverty and, as a consequence, the children who reside in these homes continue to face many social disadvantages.  In this paper I examine the relationship between public policy and the economic resources of children in single-parent homes across 18 western countries.
1	Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, I compare the academic attitudes of high school students from Generation X and the Millennial Generation. I then analyze the effects these attitudes have on mathematics achievement test scores. Compared to the earlier group, students in the later cohort were less likely to indicate academic reasons for attending school and largely perceived their friends as being less engaged academically. Students in both cohorts whose friends held academic values experienced an increase in math scores. The more students in the earlier cohort disagreed that they came to school for academic reasons, the more their math scores decreased; this relationship did not appear for the later cohort. Females in each cohort showed stronger academic attitudes than males; additionally, believing that popularity was important was associated with lower test scores for females, but not males, in the Millennial cohort. 
0	Despite the debate over 30 years on the socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing, the consensus on its true effects is still unsettled. The debate is centered on theoretical considerations of early motherhood as a harmful event and teen mothers preexisting socioeconomic disadvantages; and methodological challenges against selection bias. Alternative models have been developed, but tend to rely on strong assumptions and unrepresentative samples. This study extends this literature by employing a counterfactual approach using propensity score matching; and using data from Add Health. The counterfactual analysis attempts to obtain the causal effects of teenage childbearing by identifying better comparison groups to teen mothers, based on observed covariates. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to address selection bias on unobserved covariates. Add Health helps to capture recent changes in welfare policy and adolescent population composition. Results show that teenage childbearing has statistically negative effects--but smaller than conventional regression estimates--on educational attainment, but no effects on labor market outcomes and welfare dependency. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.
0	This paper describes the problem of multiple comparisons.  It reviews several methods adjusting for multiple testing, contrasting family-wise error rate (FWER) methods with more recent false discovery rate (FDR) methods. It explores some reasons why multiple comparison methods have not been more widely adopted in sociology, concentrating on the limitations of FWER methods, especially those pertaining to power and to testing under dependency. The features of FDR methods addressing these limitations are emphasized. An example from survey data research supports the argument that FDR methods may have high utility for sociology.
1	Organizational and environmental sociology contain surprisingly few studies of the corporation as one of the sources of environmental pollution. To fill this gap, we focus on the parent company as the unit of analysis and elaborate environmental theories that focus on the organizational and political-legal causes of pollution. Using a compiled longitudinal dataset of corporations in Standard & Poor's 500 from 1994 through 2001, we test hypotheses derived from an organizational political economy framework. We find that corporations with more complex structures, greater capital dependence and those headquartered in a state with lower environmental standards have higher pollution rates. In addition, the dollar amount of penalties did not curb pollution rates during this period of weakened federal environmental protection.
0	This paper explores selectively the thought of Pierre Bourdieu with attention to images of capital acquisition and conversion in order to conceptualize the career and scholarly work conditions of American academics employed as professors in major research universities.  Much has been written about the terrains of higher education, viewed sociologically, psychologically, anthropologically, and politically.  Yet, few scholarly contributions have examined the contexts of professors work relative to their support for or constraint upon knowledge production as a desirable social aim.  Although concerns have been raised about the applicability of Bourdieus work to settings beyond the specific context of French higher education, it is possible to use his writings as opportunities to explore academic contextual issues (with attention to contextual constraint) in generic ways and relative to their resonance with American higher education. The paper capitalizes on these opportunities to frame the content of professors scholarly careers and the social sites that shape their knowledge production efforts. The paper employs Bourdieus ideas to address this aim, due to his concern with the social and cultural contexts  and power dynamics  that frame lives, individually and collectively, in institutions and in society more broadly.  The paper closes with a set of ideas drawn from the works of social, sociocultural, and cognitive psychologists to consider possibilities for supporting scholarly learning, even within contexts of constraint as outlined by Bourdieu.
1	Although largely ignored in the growing literature about college choice that adopts a random utility modeling frame-work, there is reason to believe that the estimates are sensitive to the criteria used to define the choice sets. Accordingly, this paper examines the methodological and substantive implications of using merit (class rank) and socioeconomic (high school strata) to define college choice sets. Using Texas as a case study, results show that criteria used to constrain choice sets-and type of high school attend in particular-not only produce quite different post-secondary institutional profiles, but also different estimates of institutional attributes on students' top choice. These findings have methodological implications for future research about college choice and substantive importance for the prospects that the Texas top 10% law, which guarantees automatic admission to students who graduate in the top decile of their high school class, will equalize access to the state's competitive public institutions.

0	In this paper, I argue for a new approach to a rather old-fashioned sort of evidence for cross-national cultural analysis: short fiction in popular magazines.  I provide a concrete example of such analysis, answer major methdological objections, and point out the light shed by recent scholarship on the distinctive strengths and weaknesses of this sort of evidence.
1	Several studies have recently found that world income inequality declined during the closing years of the twentieth century. However, these studies feature a number of shortcomings, including the use of outdated national income estimates to measure inequality between countries, as well as sparse data to capture the smaller (but growing) component found within countries. The current study addresses these concerns and offers new estimates of world income inequality based on 151 countries covering 95 percent of the world's population during the 1990-2008 period. Overall, the results are fairly compatible with prior efforts, lending greater confidence to earlier findings. Nevertheless, the results suggest that prior studies covering the 1990s overestimate the decline in between-country inequality, but underestimate the rise in within-country inequality. Consequently, total inequality did not begin to decline substantially until the post-2000 era. After presenting these estimates, I then examine factors associated with income mobility among the 15,100 subnational percentile groups in my data set. The results suggest that (a) the negative effect of inequality is larger than the positive effect of economic growth among the poorest 25 percent of the world's population, and (b) late industrialization has contributed to income convergence between countries, while economic globalization has primarily served to stretch income distributions within nations.
1	A social problem that has preoccupied sociologists of gender and mental health is the higher rate of depression found among women. Although a number of hypotheses about this health disparity between men and women have been advanced, none consider the importance of subjectively experienced anger. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights from the sociology of emotion, we hypothesize that: (1. intense and persistent anger are associated with more symptoms of depression, and (2. sex differences in the intensity and persistence of anger are involved in the sex difference in depressed affect. Analyses of data from the 1996 GSS Emotions Module provide support for these two hypotheses and strongly suggest that women's intense and persistent anger play a pivotal role in their high rate of depression. We discuss the extent to which sex differences in these emotions are a function of social factors, biological factors, or a complex interaction between them. We also comment on the implications of our findings for future theory and research on gender, emotion and mental health.
1	This study outlines a new explanation for homophily in social networks that is neither intended nor imposed by constraints on partner choices. Rather, homophily is an endogenous product of the emergent exchange process, in which actors seek high-value partners who reciprocate their gestures. Whereas all actors initially direct exchange toward higher value partners, the gestures of lower value actors are more likely to go unreciprocated. This imbalance drives lower value actors to seek new partners, who end up being others who are also lower value. The consequence is homophily on value despite no such preference. I draw upon social exchange theory to articulate how this process unfolds in a newly forming network. A laboratory experiment tests hypotheses about how exchange patterns change over time. Findings reveal that shifts in participants' behavior over time were consistent with a concern for reciprocity, resulting in increasing levels of homophily in the network.
1	"Although many sociologists are strongly wedded to the idea of ""social construction,"" the contextual factors that influence the magnitude of construction are rarely considered. This article explores the decoupling of an actor's status from the actor's underlying quality and examines the factors that influence the magnitude of decoupling. The authors specifically consider the role of quality uncertainty, diffuse status characteristics, and the self-fulfilling prophecy. To analyze the impact of each mechanism on decoupling, they simulate the evolution of thousands of small groups using a dyadic model of status allocation. The authors discuss the results of these simulations and conclude with the implications for future research and the practical management of groups."
1	Theoretically, we consider the effects of workers' discontent with their paid work and their unpaid household work on the health of their spouse. We examine ways in which gendering shapes these effects. Empirically, we perform ordered probit, probit, selection-corrected probit and bivariate probit analyses of data from the 1987-1988 and 1992-1994 waves of the National Survey of Families and Households. We find that if wives are discontent with the appreciation they receive for their paid employment, then their husbands' health declines subsequently (n = 644 couples); if husbands are discontent with the fairness of their unpaid household labor, then their wives' health declines subsequently (n = 609 couples). Findings and implications are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
